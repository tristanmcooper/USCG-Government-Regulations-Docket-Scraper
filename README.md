## Overview
This project is a Python-based tool developed for the RAND Corporation to automate the extraction and analysis of comments from various stakeholders in a federal rule-making project. For example, it fetched over 15,000 comments from 1,200 stakeholders in the pilot test, showing that it can enhance accessibility for government researchers and improve operational efficiency through advanced data handling.
## Using the Jupyter Notebook

This project includes a Jupyter Notebook that provides an interactive environment to explore and run the Python scripts for data extraction and analysis. Follow these steps to set up and use the notebook effectively.


## Installation
To run this project, you need Python and several libraries. You can install the required libraries using the run command on the first cell in the notebook. They look like this:

```bash
pip install requests pandas
