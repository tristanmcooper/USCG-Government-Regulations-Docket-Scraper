Given some people's propensity for danger and curiosity during natural disasters, this rule would help to curb injuries and casualties during natural disasters. Considering the increasing number of natural disasters our coasts are expected to be subjected to in the coming years, this rule seems like a necessary measure to prevent more damage to property or human life. If enacted, this provision could save innumerable lives!
In years past, my hometown in South Georgia was ravaged by hurricanes and tornadoes, and one of the first things people want to do in the midst of natural destruction is drive around and see the damage first hand. Since this rule would prevent this sort of rubbernecking on South Floridian waterways, it would greatly benefit both civilians and first responders who are better trained for water travel and more justified in their use of the waterways.

Potomac River is utilized by members of the community and small local businesses and non-profit organizations. Members of the public access the river for fishing, boating, jet skiing, swimming, kayaking, and canoeing. There are even kayak and canoe training classes specifically for disabled veterans to assist them with rehabilitation. 
The previous rule entirely restricted access to the security zone that covered the waters next to Trump National Golf Club at Potomac Falls when persons protected by the U.S. Secret Service, such at President Trump, were on the Golf Club property. When the security zone would be enacted under these circumstances, the U.S. Coast Guard was required to enact the security zone, without notice, restricting access to the public who intended to use the river. 
This caused more than an inconvenience to the public. Businesses and non-profits providing recreational activities to the public were required, without notice, to stop business. This impacted the taxpayers enjoyment of the water, the consumers access to recreational activities, and cut short the summer camps that had been pre-paid. Further, when the restriction was enacted after individuals were on the water, it could prevent them from getting back to the docking station. This is not only inconvenient, but potentially dangerous as individuals often expect to spend a specified amount of time using rented equipment on the river. The previous security zone caused a danger to the public who were already on the rivers as boaters, who are generally without phones, food, medication, sun protection, or other necessities when on the water, did not have the notice to prepare for longer time on the river. 
This modified rule allows for a 250-yard transit lane, farthest from the course, to continue to be used when the security zone is enacted. As a result, it allows the camps to continue as scheduled, it does not economically impact the small businesses, and it does not leave recreational users stranded on the water unnecessarily. Further, the U.S. Secret Service protectees safety is not compromised. In short, the modified rule serves both the safety of high-level government officials as well as the recreational and safety interests of the general public.

It is not coincidental that the original rule was promulgated in 2017, the year President Trump took office. It is also not coincidental that this rule did not need to exist prior to the time that the President took office and elected to use a golf course, owned by his organization. Though this rule need not comply with Executive Order 13771 because it is not a significant regulation action, we should consider how future rules created specifically for high-level government officials to utilize personal businesses for recreation may begin to inundate those creating and enforcing rules, as well as further infringe on the interests of the public.
It is my personal opinion that government officials with security detail using their own personal businesses to enjoy recreational activities (i.e., not acting in an official business capacity) not on government property (e.g., Camp David, The White House), should not require the general public to pay for the officials recreational activities (through tax dollars) and also sacrifice their own recreational activities. Though my opinion may seem irrelevant, we should consider all of the businesses owned and/or accessed by high-level government officials and if this rule change causes a slippery slope. By that I mean, will there be additional regulations put into place by government agencies that further restrict the publics use of land or water in an effort to support the vacation and recreation activities of high-level government officials?

I also would implore the government to continue to consider how this particular security zone (and future zones) impact the First Amendment rights of citizens. It has been suggested that the security zone was enacted to prevent individuals from peacefully assembling and petitioning the government when high-level government officials were present at the Golf Club. While individuals are permitted to contact Geoffrey White or Dennis Holland, program managers for the U.S. Coast Guard and Department of Homeland Security, to coordinated protest activities, the public should have the right to appear on public property (without infringing on others rights) to protest without coordination, consistent with our fundamental, constitutional rights. 

Though the interim rule is a decent compromise that still allows for the security protection of high-level government officials and ensures public use of the waterway, issues of future rules and the First Amendment should continue to be considered.

The shortening of the security zone, a transit zone by the Maryland bank, and the establishment of a corridor to access the Potowmac Canal (aka George Washington Canal) and keep us away from Dam #2 should mostly address our needs. 

I would prefer that the transit zone be instead simply a corridor outside the security zone. I assume a transit zone was done to maintain control over traffic, if needed. I am not clear on what getting permission from the Captain of the Port entails. I am of the impression that it means being given the go-ahead by some on-site Coast Guard staff, not some advanced permit. To that end, I am concerned that the individual on duty is fully briefed on what this rule allows. I have had experiences involving access to previously restricted waters where the rule had changed, but officers with authority over access, did not know of or understand the change. Supporting this concern, I have been hearing some accounts by fellow boaters who have been stopped for no apparent reason.

I lived through the Kennedy assassination, so I fully understand the burden and need for protecting our president. I am confident that the proposed accommodation for river recreation will not compromise security.",,,,,,,

There are constantly changing upgrades to EPIRBs, electronic charts, navigation tools, firefighting/lifesaving equipment, etc., that a modern professional mariner must be familiar with.  It is also especially critical for officers to have recent familiarization of vessel handling, seakeeping, and docking characteristics on appropriate sized vessels for which the mariner seeks license authority for.

The reasons for Congress to extend the recency requirement for uniformed service personnel to seven years is a matter of record.  However, the USCG has no statutory mandate to change the recency requirement for all mariners.  For the reasons stated above, it could be detrimental to public safety and the environment if the recency requirement is extended to seven years for all mariners and/or if the recency requirement were to be eliminated.

Note that the recency requirement was in effect even before the USCG licensing/manning regulations were overhauled and rewritten in the 1980s.  There was discussion during that rulemaking project regarding if the recency requirement should be kept or eliminated.  I have firsthand knowledge that the recency requirement was kept for the reasons stated in my first paragraph above.

It is especially important to note that the recency requirement has always contained the wording appropriate tonnage or horsepower, and the word appropriate should remain intact and even emphasized.  For example, to obtain a 500 GRT deck officer endorsement the regulations require a certain amount of sea service on vessels over 50 GRT.  The USCG National Maritime Center (NMC) evaluators are currently being trained to apply this tonnage part of the recency requirement for deck officer endorsements over 200 GRT.  I concur with this practice, as it would not be appropriate if the over-50 GRT service was many years ago.  If the recent service was on a vessel under 50 GRT, then the mariner would not have recent experience on a vessel of appropriate tonnage regarding vessel handling, navigation equipment, firefighting/navigation equipment, etc.

But I find it detrimental to public safety and the environment that the NMC is training evaluators to ignore the tonnage portion of the recency requirement for deck officer endorsements of 25 to 200 GRT (see attached page from NMC evaluator training).  This exception appears to be randomly interpreted and applied, as no such exception wording appears (or has ever appeared) in USCG regulations.  And note that the recency regulation is not in a subpart that applies exclusively to officer endorsements over 200 GRT.  The tonnage part of the recency requirement is just as important (if not more important) for officer endorsements up to 200 GRT.  NMC has been issuing 100 GRT officer endorsements to mariners who have no recent service on vessels of appropriate tonnage.  An example would be a 55 year old mariner applying for a 100 GRT master endorsement whose only service on vessels over 50 or over 33 GRT was as a deckhand when he was a teenager.  NMC would issue him a 100 GRT license allowing him to be the master of a 99 GRT T-boat even if his recent service was on a 16 bass boat.  Keeping in mind my opening paragraph, the safety/navigation equipment and handling characteristics of a 16 bass boat do not even compare to those of a 99 GRT T-boat.

The recency regulation does not apply to, and has never applied to, renewals of national officer endorsements.  That should remain unchanged, because sea service is not required to renew officer endorsements.  Sea service is only one of several renewal options, therefore sea service is not a renewal mandate.  Another renewal option is an open-book renewal exercise that the USCG mails to mariners to complete at their leisure using any available reference material.  With that being such an easy renewal option, I see no compelling reason to make the sea service renewal option more stringent by making the recency requirement applicable to renewals.

A change in Federal law would apply to boaters in all 50 states and 6 territories and violations could result in penalties, tickets, insurance claims, court actions, property damage and/or personal injury and medical treatment. By definition, recreational boaters are more likely to be engaged in activities other than boating for most of their time, so are reliant on agencies such as the Coast Guard or fire department to provide reliable guidance in appropriate safety measures during their maritime past-time boating activities. While a change in the rules is proposed, this comment focuses on the ambiguous terms ""good and serviceable"" with the suggestion that these terms are not appropriate for recreational fire extinguishers and should be redefined or clarified during the rule making revision. Part 175 Sub part E 175.310 defines criteria such as weight, dates of service, pressure gauge reading, etc. that may define ""good"", but are not ""serviceable"" for disposable fire extinguishers commonly available and utilized by recreational boaters. In addition to modifying the terms ""good and serviceable"", recreational boaters should be aware that the different ignition sources on their boats may require different types and sizes of extinguishing or suppressing equipment. A novice attempt to fight a fire with the improper extinguisher may be more hazardous than donning their life jackets and abandoning ship. Regardless of the length or method of propulsion, many boats have electrical wiring (lights, horns, radios, etc.), cooking equipment (gasses, frying lard or shortening, microwaves, flames, etc), pyrotechnic signals (flares), recreational smoking devices, gas lanterns, generators, etc. that could possibly lead to accidental fires. In summary, the Coast Guard, for good reasons, proposes to further separate safety requirements on board pleasure craft and working vessels. I would suggest that the terms ""good and serviceable"" are not well-defined enough to apply to recreational boaters to be a law or enforceable policy. Adherence to the law would save life and property and non compliance with the law could lead to adverse enforcement actions and/or unacceptable risk to life and property in a recreational endeavor. With property and injury at stake, the policy should be modified to reflect current practices of disposable devices that are typically not serviceable. A review of available data for the type of fires encountered on boats (grease, electrical, paper, explosion, etc) may shed light on the type (A,B,C, etc) of equipment needed by the boater to be safe.  The burden of the rule revision is insignificant compared to the burden of a burned boat or personal injury due to improper equipment carriage and/or usage.      ",,,,,,,

In the last 15 years or so the Coast Guards role has changed greatly.  Homeland Security activities, among other things, have expanded the Coast Guards responsibilities outside recreational boating.

While I dont have a problem removing the record keeping requirements for portable fire extinguishers, I do believe the monthly inspection requirements for fire extinguishers should remain in place.  Brief, monthly inspections are not a burden.  Many recreational boats are not in use for the full 12 months of the year so a monthly inspection would only take place perhaps 6 or 8 times a year.

If a fire occurs in a building or on a boat at the dock, occupants have the reasonable safe opportunity for egress.  Most will flee and call for help.  But when a fire occurs on a boat that is out on the open water, occupants have a very limited opportunity for safe egress, and the availability, type, size, operation and number of fire extinguishers becomes a very critical part in the life safety process.

I have concerns that the limited and challenged Coast Guard resources have resulted in the Coast Guards diminished role in the recreational boating industry oversight.  This proposal will remove the fire extinguisher requirements for recreational boats from the monitored and managed 46CFR part 25.30 to the relatively unmonitored and unmanaged 33CFRPart 175.
Regardless of what the CFR eventually contains the existing fire extinguisher requirements, the information as published (updated in 2016) in the current 46CFR part 25.30 are not appropriate recommendations.  Fires and fire extinguishers have three different classifications  A - B and C.   An A fire is normal combustibles, wood, paper, fiberglass, cushions.   B fire is flammable and combustible liquids and a C fire is an electrical fire.  All three of these potential fires exist on a boat and therefore A-B-C capable fire extinguishers are necessary and should be installed.  The current Coast Guard fire extinguisher requirements only call for B capable fire extinguishers to be carried on the boat.  The recognized need for A and C capable fire extinguishers is ignored. 

In addition, the current Coast Guard requirements specify an inadequate number of extinguishers be carried on board.  For example, a 62 foot boat with a fixed engine room fire extinguishing system, requires only two 2lb (B type) extinguishers.  A 2 lb extinguisher contains about 6 to 8 seconds of fire fighting use.  Both the fire extinguisher type and quantity are inadequate as specified in the CFR.

There are a number of well intended state, local and private boating safety concerns who download, reprint and distribute these federal recreational vessel fire extinguisher requirements.  This information does not advise the boating public appropriately. 

Other regulatory groups participate in the safety standards process for recreational boats.  The American Boat and Yacht Council (ABYC) is the primary recreational boating standards organization in the United States.  The ABYC publishes over 50 standards and technical bulletins which are each maintained and updated every three to five years.  ABYC A-4 Fire Protection Equipment is one of these standards but A-4 has been reviewed only once in the last 11 years.  This is not an oversight.

The National Marine Manufacturers Association maintains the Boat and Yacht Certification Program.  This boat builder program contains about 50 ABYC Standards and Technical Bulletins that a builder must adhere to in order to achieve the NMMA Boat and Yacht Certification.  Conspicuous by its absence, the ABYC A-4 Standard is not part of the NMMA certification.  This too is not an oversight  this is a strategy that the ABYC and NMMA should explain.

The US Coast Guard publishes annually Boating Safety Statistics.  The number of reported recreational boat fire events are published in this report.  NFPA Vehicle Fire reports comprised of data taken from fire departments in the United States suggest that occurrence and losses from boat fires is approximately 6 or 7 times that of the USCG statistics.  
       
Summary
Move the portable fire extinguisher requirements for recreational vessels from 46 CFR to 33 CFR (with no measurable positive impact) as proposed.  Perhaps the requirement for recordkeeping should be excused but the multiple use of the word burden in the Federal Registers Request for Comment is not at all appropriate when it comes to the fire protection preparations for a recreational boat owner.  Inspecting an important piece of marine safety gear is not a burden for a prudent boat owner/operator. 
Please insure that the recreational boating community is protected with an appropriate, applicable and managed fire protection standard.

[Docket No. USCG20180493]
The decision on the part of the USCG to allow for the use of a Letter of Designation (LOD) as Person in Charge(PIC) of fuel transfers on inspected vessels under this Part is commendable.  Particularly for the applicability to the maritime towing industry currently in transition from uninspected to inspected under Subchapter M.  We have been using an LOD process for PIC for many years. In procedures within our TSMS, the trainee (i.e. new hire deckhand) assist in all aspects of multiple vessel specific F/O transfers (refueling), L/O replenishment, etc., until that person has gained sufficient formal instruction from the operator [the Company] and [the Company] ensures their ability to safely and adequately carry out the duties and responsibilities of the PIC.  When the vessel Captain (PIC) makes this determination by review the individuals supervised refueling history, knowledge of vessel systems and emergency response procedures, the Captain designates that person as PIC by letter to the Company Designated Person and certifies this designation by endorsement to that letter. A Fuel Transfer Authorization Log is updated and the PIC Designation Letter is maintained onboard the vessel. This is a vessel specific Designation and not transferable between vessels. Upon reporting to a vessel new to the deckhand, the PIC vessel specific LOD process starts anew as we have no sister vessels.
Per request in this NPRM, there would be no additional cost incurred to this Company under this proposed Rule.
In the interim, I would encourage the USCG, having the authority under 46 U.S.C. 3703 (a)(4), to implement the LOD option via Policy Letter pending the effective date of this Rule.  Towing vessels are being certificated on a daily basis and the requirement (Policy Letter 01-17) for an MMC with endorsement of Tankerman Person In Charge (PIC) Restricted to Fuel Transfers on Towing Vessels remains for those vessels without tankerman required to mid-stream during refueling. This is currently burdensome and in my view, without qualitative research, may become detrimental to safely conducting refueling operations for the following reasons;
	Cost of Tankerman (PIC) Restricted to Fuel Transfers on Towing Vessels endorsement is $140 (MMC and evaluation). Since the Master, Mate, or Pilot most often must remain in the wheelhouse (i.e. maintaining position along a fuel flat), virtually all unlicensed deckhands assigned to vessel must have this endorsement.
	A licensed employee (with MMC) may demand higher pay rates with no additional gain in experience, training, or knowledge.
	Risk level may actually increases. Despite the fact that most companies have a PIC process as noted above, specific training requirements for this endorsement itself, per Policy Letter 01-17, are waived. 
	The Tankerman (PIC) Restricted to Fuel Transfers on Towing Vessels endorsement is not vessel specific and there is no regulatory requirement for such creating a likely potential for an endorsed deckhand new to a vessel whom conducts transfers while unfamiliar with vessel specific procedures.

As a crew member I see too many accidents and spills that are not reported from untrained crews. Companies do not want to pay trained and competent workers. I have sent several qualified personnel to apply but companies do not want to pay a meaningful wage. The pay offered to one person I sent to apply came out to be only a little over $8 an hour.   

In the last several years I have seen a serious decline in safety and an increase in small accidents. I have seen numerous small spills that have gone unreported and one large spill which was over 14000 gallons we were told by management was 14 gallons.  All of these were preventable and caused by either poor training,  negligence or bypassing safety requirements. 

In addition mariners are over worked. Companies have been pushing STCW watch hours and pushing crews to work 14hrs a day illegally. 

I have worked on commercial vessels for 20 years and I have never seen as many safetu problems as I have in the last few years.

The recent GAP closure training is a similar situtio while shielding foreign mariners on foreign vessels from complying with that change while disqualifying US Mariners was a blatant coddling and protection of industry by forcing Americans to comply while allowing foreign mariners and companies to profit.

Additionally,  lowering standards so industry can cut costs is the standard response when a regulation hinders industry but keeps things safe for mariners, the environment safe.  Witness Deepwater Horizon where drilling in ultra-deepwater everywhere else in the world required two blow out preventers give one in the Gulf of Mexico.  The argument was industry knew what was safe and the government did not.  How did that work out? Also with the rise in accidents in the inland industry in the last few years, I feel, as a professional marine for 40 years and retired Coast Guard, this pandering to industry must stop and mariners, the environment need to take priority and if those costs for better safety passed on to the users.

I am decidely against the proposed rule making to relax PIC requirements...   There's no sustitution for required training and obtaining loads and discharges.  

""Letters of Designation"" which relieve PIC's of gaining required training and/or Loads and Discharges is a faulty avenue which will bring more spills and accidents.  

There should be a PIC- Fueling certification for those who Bunker and Transfer aboard the smaller Uninsepcted Vessels who will be soon Certificated.  

ALso, there must be NO easy avenue where individuals could apply this to obtain Tankerman-PIC for service aboard Tank Vessels without advanced schooling... ",,,,,,,

As a senior engineering officer aboard a Jones Act qualified product tanker, I see first hand the issues with Engineers and PIC requirements.  My employer requires all officers to maintain a Tankerman PIC endorsement, even Engineers with no involvement in the cargo transfer process.  The company maintains the belief that fuel/bunker transfers are equally dangerous, hence requiring the PIC endorsement.  99% of Engineers in my fleet could not knowledgably transfer cargo.  It's just not something we do.  Same as a Deck Officer could not repair the Main Engine.  

The requirements for when a Tankerman PIC endorsement is required should be revised.  A Tankerman Engineer endorsement is satisfactory, provided the classroom requirements focus on fuel/bunker transfers, which is ultimately what Engineers are primarily concered with.  Not every ship in the Jones Act fleet is an oil tanker, thus obtaining the Tankerman PIC endorsement is not possible.  A basic level of education - and the responsibilities involved - in the dangers of fuel/bunker processes is paramount.

As to persons working aboard the bunker barges, the above should equally apply.  If a ship is required to have a Tankerman endorsement (PIC or Engineer) maintain responsibility for the transfer, the person working aboard the transferring barge should also be endorsed and educated to the same level of care.  When I receive bunkers from a barge, I cannot control the actions of the barge, pumping the fuel on board my ship.  If an incident were to occur, the level of education and formal training would factor into the investigation when determining fault.  The barge personnel would then be absolved from certain aspects of the investigation based solely on their status of being lesser endorsed/educated.  Meanwhile, the PIC/Engineer endorsed person aboard the ship would bear the brunt of liability based on their endorsements/education, notwithstanding their inability to control the actions of the bunker barge and/or personnel.",,,,,,,

The revision is timely due to the changes to the facility with LNG being exported rather than imported, and the possibility of small scale vessels calling to load at Elba Island.

While we agree with and welcome the proposed changes, we also notice that key sections of the RNA that apply only to large scale LNG Tankships, for which the RNA was intended, were inadvertently left unrevised. During the Public Meeting held on July 25, 2018, it was proposed that these paragraphs that are applicable only to large LNG Tankships be amended due to the possibility of smaller vessels in the future and all participants agreed.  We therefore propose that these paragraphs be amended as below:

Please note that the numbers of the paragraphs below are as in the original unrevised RNA, not as in the revised version, where d (3) (i) and d (3) (ii) are to be renumbered as d (2) (i) and d (2) (ii)

1.	Remove paragraph (d) (1) (iii) (D) that reads:
While transiting the RNA, LNG tankships carrying LNG in excess of heel, shall have a minimum of two escort towing vessels with a minimum of 100,000 pounds of bollard pull, 4,000 horsepower and capable of safely operating in the indirect mode. At least one of the towing vessels shall be FiFi Class 1 equipped.

2.	Remove paragraph d (3) (i) and d (3) (ii) that read:
(d) (3) (i)
An LNG tankship moored inside the LNG facility slip shall have two standby towing vessels with a minimum capacity of 100,000 pounds of bollard pull, 4,000 horsepower, and the ability to operate safely in the indirect mode. At least one of these towing vessels shall be FiFi Class 1 equipped. The standby towing vessels shall take appropriate action in an emergency.

(d) (3) (ii)
If two LNG tankships are moored inside the LNG facility slip, each vessel shall provide a standby towing vessel that is FiFi class 1 equipped with a minimum capacity of 100,000 pounds of bollard pull and 4,000 horsepower that is available to assist.




As an alternative, if the paragraphs are not to be removed, we then propose as a second preference,  that the text be amended as below to make clear that the requirements apply only to large scale LNG Tankships, as was intended in the old version of the RNA, but not clearly identified as such:

Please note that the numbers of the paragraphs below are as in the original unrevised RNA, not as in the revised version, where d (3) (i) and d (3) (ii)  would be renumbered as d (2) (i) and d (2) (ii)

(d) (1) (iii) (D)
While transiting the RNA, LNG tankships of cargo capacity over 120,000 m3, carrying LNG in excess of heel, shall have a minimum of two escort towing vessels with a minimum of 100,000 pounds of bollard pull, 4,000 horsepower and capable of safely operating in the indirect mode. At least one of the towing vessels shall be FiFi Class 1 equipped.

(d) (3) (i)
An LNG tankship of cargo capacity over 120,000 m3, moored inside the LNG facility slip shall have two standby towing vessels with a minimum capacity of 100,000 pounds of bollard pull, 4,000 horsepower, and the ability to operate safely in the indirect mode. At least one of these towing vessels shall be FiFi Class 1 equipped. The standby towing vessels shall take appropriate action in an emergency.

(d) (3) (ii)
If two LNG tankships of cargo capacity over 120,000 m3 are moored inside the LNG facility slip, each vessel shall provide a standby towing vessel that is FiFi class 1 equipped with a minimum capacity of 100,000 pounds of bollard pull and 4,000 horsepower that is available to assist.

There is concern with the following revision of the RNA;
Additionally, because transiting vessels can communicate and safely transit each other using VHF communications the Coast Guard has proposed removing various bridge watch requirements for vessels moored at the Southern LNG facility. These proposed changes are necessary to ensure the safety of persons and property within the RNA during LNG tankship operations and transfers after changes in the facility layout.

By removing the Docking Pilot as watch stander on the bridge of the LNG tankship one of the layers of safety is being eliminated. The Deck Officer will not have local knowledge of the Savannah River. The Deck Officer is not trained or proficient with communicating with inbound and outbound traffic, nor to give orders to the standby tugs.

There are numerous instances where tugs in the RNA have acted under the command of the Docking Pilots and incidents have been averted. This has been proven true when an LNG tanker in the slip was pulled off the dock by an inbound tanker. Further damages were diminished by the Docking Pilot and tugs. Immediately, the Docking Pilot properly positioned the tugs to safely maneuver the vessel back alongside. A ships Deck Officer does not have training or experience to coordinate this situation. This happened within a matter of minutes.

The Docking Pilot and River Pilot have been able to use their expertise collaboratively to avoid many issues. The Docking Pilot was able to assign the proper tugs to guard the LNG tanker or the passing vessel with no incidents.

To our knowledge, no other port has such a narrow channel where two post panamax vessels pass by a docked LNG tankship. Also, these large vessels are passing at low tide so they may safely pass under the Talmadge Bridge. During low water there is a greater chance of surge. Therefore, the proposed change of removing the bridge watch will not ensure the safety of persons and property.

All vessels in the Savannah River are to standby channels 13 and 16.

Apparently this bridge tender is familiar with this person and if this type of thing continues, the study on bridge openings will not be worth anything.  Yes, there are exceptions and that is acceptable, but opening the bridge for someone who may be an acquaintance isn't.

As a boat owner who transits this area, I would like to see more frequent openings. I do not see a vehicle traffic flow study in the file but I will offer some time suggestions. Of course data would allow for more accurate timeframes. My issue with the infrequent openings 24/7 is waiting at times of the days for up to 30 minutes in a sailboat or large motor boat. Keep in mind that often there is significant tidal flow in the area that may hinder a vessel from staying safely in the channel.
I will make 2 proposals that I would hope you consider.
1) Restrict openings from 0700 - 0900  and 1600 - 1800 on weekdays. All other times would be on demand.
2) Restrict openings from 0700 -1900 during weekdays only.

Keep in mind that boat owners support area business. We often stop at the marina, eat in local restaurants and shop in near by stores or even visit the farmers market.

The deviation test period was a great success. It worked really well for automobile and boat traffic. Knowing the time in advance when the bridge would open for boat traffic allowed everyone to plan ahead of time. Lines of vehicles waiting at the bridge were much shorter because most local residents knew it was best not to try to cross the bridge in the first 15 minutes of the hour. Boat traffic passing through the bridge on the hour were able to group together instead of just one boat at a time passing through when the bridge opened on demand. 

The on the hour opening reduced the chances an emergency vehicle (fire truck, ambulance) and medical first responders would be blocked from crossing the bridge by at least 50 to 60%. 

The lifespan of the bridge will be increased with the limited number of openings. This will save taxpayers added cost for repairs and replacement.

I believe that everyone will benefit if the deviation is made permanent. 

Please feel free to call me if I can be of any help to solve this major problem for many.",,,,,,,

As such, St. Martin Parish embraces the proposition that the bridge be opened  as requested by the La. DOTD.  Indeed, we have been advised that the deviation test period was successful in reducing both boat and vehicular traffic congestion.

As a resident of Belle River, I often have to wait as much as 15 minutes on one side of the bridge to cross, complete my errands and then have to wait 15 minutes or more to get back across.  At certain times of the year this situation is even worse.  There is now a new boat launch on the south side of Hwy. 70 at the bridge so boaters can tie up, walk across the highway to the local bar with no need for the bridge to open..
   Vehicular traffic waiting for the bridge to open for them often stretched nearly a mile on Hwy. 70 toward Morgan City and an equal distance on Hwy. 70 coming from Pierre Part.  
   I personally have been late for meetings, and work sitting at the bridge waiting to cross.  I don't think sports boats should be able to cause the bridge to open at random.  If a set time is established everyone will be able to abide by the rules.  Linda Cooke     ",,,,,,,

This could be a great way of testing for those things and making sure the coast guard knows these things for emergencies is a good idea. 

Although the closing of the drawbridge will be inconvenient to some, in the long run it will prove useful if managed correctly in these coming months. ",,,,,,,

It us my ardent hope that your study obtains scientific input inrather than simply allowing oil drilling and more vessel traffic that could result in oil spills in a very remote area that lacks infrastructure. 

I agree with the letter submitted by 
Audubon Alaska, Friends of the Earth International,Oceana, Ocean Conservancy, Pacific Environment, Pew Charitable Trusts, The Nature Conservancy, World Wildlife Fund that it is vitally important to ""seek out and incorporate the best available information about the marine ecosystem.... seeking out and incorporating both science and traditional knowledge, and treating both knowledge systems with equal respect...[and]... Conduct[ing] a robust outreach effort that solicits and incorporates information from key stakeholder groups and satisfies the Coast Guards legal obligation to consult with Alaska Native federally recognized tribes and tribal organizations.""

I also very much agree with them that you must ""Consider the highly dynamic nature of the region, taking into account both seasonal and longer-term changes in sea ice, marine wildlife migrations and subsistence hunting practices. The Coast Guard should be mindful that the region is changing rapidly, and it may not be possible to accurately identify the time and location of future maritime activities. Vessel traffic mitigation measures should be flexible enough to account for this uncertainty."" 

My fear is oil drilling and shipping vessel oil spills and fervently hope you will be extremely careful that any changes in the artic coastline be done to minimize any negative environmental impact.

I appreciate the aspects of this study that will consider a. how increased shipping traffic will impact local communities and their ability to continue to utilize the land and ocean for subsistence living and b. studying the wildlife migration patters and how they may be affected by increased shipping traffic. Because the area is so isolated I suggest a strong focus on gathering information from and about the local populations in the geographical areas of interest. This information can shape future studies that will become important if shipping to these areas is, in fact, increased.

Relevant information pertaining to local communities that could benefit this and future studies could include:

Noting a communities medical and legal resources (how many doctors, hospitals, clinics, police stations, police officers, courthouses, judges, etc.) An increase in shipping traffic means an increase in people and likely an influx of potential sources of illness and disease (if a local community has been isolated from contact and exposure to diversity). An increase in traffic could also increase the need for law enforcement officers or the need for a City to update its civil and criminal code. A lot of these communities are already struggling with these issues. Noting the different capacities a community has and gathering this information while on the ground during this study could provide valuable information about a community's ability to grow and deal with an increase in increased shipping traffic.",,,,,,,

Even though much of the wildlife is suffering in the region, it is not fair to only look at vessel safety, but additional animal and wildlife safety, and precautions that vessels can take to not harm the ecosystem.

To whom it may concern:

I am writing in support of the proposed BNSF Railway Sandpoint Junction Connector Project across Lake Pend Oreille in North Idaho. Idaho and the entire Pacific Northwest region stand to gain immensely from this project. The environmental assessment (EA) done by the U.S Coast Guard (USCG) demonstrates a robust and comprehensive evaluation of potential impacts to the surrounding community and I applaud your leadership in moving this critical infrastructure project along in a timely fashion. 

The US has built a network of interstate highways encouraging the use of fuel inefficient trucking with no consideration on either the environment or development.  The BNSF has proposed the construction of a bridge to increase the use of environmentally friendly rail.  It would be a crime to retroactively deny them the ability to construct this bridge.

The proposal to build a second rail-bridge over the lake will further improve the rail system, which serves as the backbone of regional trade, supports countless industries, and benefits the economy throughout the Northwest and beyond. Just like adding an additional lane to a highway, this upgrade will expand the efficiency of freight moving across the region.

As defined in the EA, the improvements to rail infrastructure across Lake Pend Oreille are expected to relieve rail traffic congestion, reducing wait times for locomotives on the track and at important community crossings. Additionally, this increased rail capacity is expected to also reduce excess emissions from idling trains on the tracks or locomotives that need to power up to resume traveling. This project will not increase rail traffic. Any decreases or increases in rail volumes are determined by the market. What this project does do is ensure that current traffic levels can run more proficiently than it has in the past with just the single track.

The EA also concludes that the Sandpoint Junction Connector will not result in significant impacts to any elements of the human or natural environment. In fact, the company worked collaboratively with the USCG to identify important mitigation efforts for certain fish. BNSF is clearly invested in proactively ensuring this project will achieve full compliance with stringent environmental standards that will keep our community healthy and safe. 

The Pacific Northwest depends on an efficient rail network to safely deliver the goods that we use every single day. As the economy continues to grow and consumer demand rises, the need for increased rail investment follows right alongside this upward trend.

After reviewing the EA, I am confident that the Sandpoint Junction Connector project will be held to the highest of standards, have no significant impacts on our community and deserves swift approval. Plus, since private investment is funding 100 percent of this project, the community will benefit from this critical infrastructure upgrade without having to pay for it.

Thank you for your consideration of this important matter.

Sincerely,
",,,,,,,

 I'm concerned that the scope of the Coast Guard's environmental assessment, as drafted, is too limited to adequately inform rail line communities of all the impacts associated with this project, if it were approved.

As someone who lives along the coast, I have already had experience of BNSF carrying out inadequate environmental assessments which led to our community being seriously impacted without ever having having been included in an environmental review. 

We were fortunate, and the threat of legal action persuaded BNSF to make changes in where their trains idled  (since they were idling for hours 20 feet away from a heavily used community park!). However the whole situation could have been avoided if BNSF had carried out an adequate environmental review that included ALL of the affected communities.

The plan to go ahead with a second bridge will impact rural and urban communities throughout the Pacific Northwest. I am concerned that this is another example of inadequate environmental assessment.  The Coast Guard's environmental assessment, as currently drafted, without full input from the community, cannot adequately public weigh all the costs, benefits, and risks of BNSF's proposal.

I request the United States Coast Guard require and complete an Environmental Impact Statement, before any further decisions are issued on BNSF's proposal to construct a second rail bridge across Lake Pend Oreille.

A project of this magnitude must not be rushed - we deserve all the facts. I'm concerned that the scope of the Coast Guard's environmental assessment, as drafted, is too limited to adequately inform rail line communities of all the impacts associated with this project, if it were approved. Furthermore, I'm concerned that many statements and claims in the environmental assessment, including claims that the project proposal will reduce rail congestion and vehicle delays, are not substantiated with studies or data. 

Rural and urban communities throughout the Pacific Northwest are impacted by how BNSF manages rail operations in ""the Funnel"" between Spokane, Washington and Sandpoint, Idaho - I'm worried that opening the Funnel with a second rail bridge will turn this rail line into a fire hose. More fluid rail operations may be in the corporate interests of a national rail company, but it may not be in the interest of local communities that could experience more frequent, vehicle-delaying, train traffic - some of which carry dangerous and hazardous materials that can pollute our environment and harm people. Even for communities outside Idaho, these impacts may be significant. But, the Coast Guard's environmental assessment, as currently drafted, fails to help the public weigh all the costs, benefits, and risks of BNSF's proposal.

If nothing else, I'm concerned about the risks to Lake Pend Oreille, the 5th deepest lake in the United States. Lake Pend Oreille is part of the ancestral homeland to indigenous people of the inland Pacific Northwest. The Lake is also an ecologically critical area for endangered bull trout and is a unique part of America's national heritage. I would be appalled if our federal government failed to provide the highest level of environmental review a place like this so clearly deserves.

I used to live in Bonner County,  ID, and worked in Sandpoint.  Any spillage on this lake would cause and environmental catastrophe.  This lake has a fragile ecosystem, which was seriously imperiled by decisions made by shortsighted people in the early part of the 20th Century.  However, over the past few decades, decisions have been made which have helped the lake and its native species, begin to recover.  A new railroad bridge to transport more oil and coal would likely increase the chances of an accident which would have serious repercussions on the Lake and the economy of the area.  Much of the economy is based on tourism around the Lake.  If that were disrupted, it would destroy an economy which struggles to survive.  That economy survives on the summer tourism that the Lake provides.  Many businesses make enough money during the summer months to allow them to get by during the winter months.  If an environmental catastrophe happened which polluted the Lake, many of these businesses would dry up and blow away.  This project is poor in conception and should be roundfiled!

I request the United States Coast Guard require and complete an Environmental Impact Statement, before any further decisions are issued on BNSF's proposal to construct a second rail bridge across Lake Pend Oreille.

This is not to mention the effects that continuing to exploit the planet for fossil fuels will have on climate change.

Aside from what is likely pertinent and reasonable discussion below I would like to add that going to huge expense to primarily service an industry that is very likely to kill us all if projects such as this one are continued as if they have any right to be begun. It is a screaming folly to make any concessions at this time to the endeavors of the fossil fuel industries.

Rural and urban communities throughout the Pacific Northwest are impacted by how BNSF manages rail operations in ""the Funnel"" between Spokane, Washington and Sandpoint, Idaho - I'm worried that opening the Funnel with a second rail bridge will turn this rail line into a fire hose. More fluid rail operations may be in the corporate interests of a national rail company, but it may not be in the interest of local communities that could experience more frequent, vehicle-delaying, train traffic - some of which carry dangerous and hazardous materials that can pollute our environment and harm people. Even for communities outside Idaho, these impacts may be significant. But, the Coast Guard's environmental assessment, as currently drafted, fails to help the public weigh all the costs, benefits, and risks of BNSF's proposal.

It is of great importance that we keep our economy moving, and when I see increases in rail activity, I see our economy moving in the right direction. I'm in favor of building a second bridge.

I also would like to see an increase in the amount of freight being transported by rail because of safety concerns. If we limit the amount of freight on rail, we increase the amount of freight on roads, where the incident of a crash is far higher and far more dangerous. 

With all that being said, Sandpoint is a major hub for rail activity with a North, West, East and South rail. Now is the time for the City of Sandpoint and Bonner County to demand more rail crossing arms, more safety features and better efficiency moving the trains through our area (which I believe is what the second bridge is being designed for). 

As for the likely-hood of a derailment, it's a risk/reward scenario. For the amount of the rail activity everyday in our country and across the globe, the percentage of a derailment is very low. Take the risk and mediate. Same with flying, the risk is low and the reward is high.

For Emergency Response, increase training and hire the proper people in case of a derailment. Burden should lie on the rail roads for this and not all on the local communities.

As for Socioeconomic & Cumulative Effects, I have no comment. Sounds like there is some great projects going on. Get the bridge built while the building time is good.

As for the Bull Trout, this is a straw argument and holds no water. Lake Pend Oreille is flush with Bull Trout and is one of the greatest bodies of water in the world for Bull Trout survival. A second bridge will have absolutely no bearing on that fish species. In fact the bridge will create more cover and shade for other species of desirable fish (Small & Largemouth Bass, Walleye, Pike, Perch and I would assume other trout species). 

As for Contaminant Mobilization, this is a small risk and measurements by qualified water testers should be conducted everyday during construction. If changes in heavy metal deposits are found, alter the consumption during that time and study how the construction can be done safer. My suspicion is that the heavy metal problems exist upstream of Lake Pend Oreille and that the bed of earth the second bridge will be using is under constant water movement with the lake turning into Pend Oreille River, will help dilute the water quick.

As for the Draft EA Errors, I don't see them as errors. I see them as common sense. Bring a large amount of people to an area for construction, those people are going to spend money in our community. As for more rail lines, less waits at crossing arms is a natural conclusion. 

This demand for a more stringent EIS is a stall tactic being used far too much in our country. All it will do is give a bunch of attorneys more paper work to come up with that wastes time and money. Not falling for the scare tactics. I say build the bridge. Get it done.

I support Lake Pend Oreille Waterkeeper & Idaho Conservation League because I love where I live and the lake I live on, but I don't support measures like this with a hidden agenda based on emotional thoughts and scare tactics. ",,,,,,,

This has occurred over and over again all across the country. Please do not give this corporation the opportunity to destroy our pristine lake!

BNSF Sandpoint Junction Connector Project Proposal Summary of Deficiencies
As Identified by Lake Pend Oreille Waterkeeper & Idaho Conservation League
Acronyms and Definitions
BNSF  Burlington Northern Santa Fe railway company; project applicant
EA  Environmental Assessment; determines whether or not a federal action has the potential to cause significant environmental impacts
EIS  Environmental Impact Statement; the most thorough environmental review option under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1970; performed if the project will likely have significant environmental impacts
Why an Environmental Impact Statement is needed
An EIS is needed to thoroughly evaluate impacts to the human, economic, and environmental health. Most importantly, an EIS will identify measures to mitigate impacts resulting from the project and identify any remaining unavoidable and significant adverse impacts for the benefit of rail side communities and the health of Lake Pend Oreille.
Rail Traffic & Derailment Risk
 The EA does not consider how projected increases in rail traffic volumes in our area will increase the risk of a derailment.
 According to the Idaho Statewide Rail Plan from 2013, train volumes on Idahos network are projected to increase by 143% by 2040.
 BNSF transports hazardous materials, the majority of which is volatile Bakken crude oil.
 A derailment of hazardous materials within the vicinity of the Lake Pend Oreille basin could
have serious consequences to human and environmental health and our local economy.
 Projected train traffic volumes directly relate to an evaluation of spill risk and derailment.
A study under the EIS framework is needed to clarify what these projections are and how they might impact the amount of freight moved and number of rail miles traveled.
           

         Emergency Response
 The EA does not consider how the Lake Pend Oreille and Pend Oreille River Geographic Response Plan (GRP) will need to be modified to accommodate new challenges resulting from the project.
o One of the emergency response boat launch sites is Dog Beach.
o According to the EA, Dog Beach will have limited-to-no access during construction.
 To our knowledge, the GRP is the only framework currently available for emergency
responders to use when addressing a derailment over the lake.
 The EA does not consider the limitations of the GRP in its current state, nor how BNSF would mitigate those short-comings.
An EIS would bring to light how construction would limit implementation of the GRP under all scenarios and how such limitations could be amended. An EIS could inform community leaders and emergency responders of the shortcomings of the GRP and also enables the proposal of mitigation options.
Socioeconomic & Cumulative Effects
 The EA does not consider all potential socioeconomic costs, benefits, or cumulative effects (e.g., noise pollution from construction and existing train traffic) to rail side communities.
o e.g., in Sandpoint, at least three other major construction projects are proposed to occur during the project timeline. These include the City of Sandpoint (COS) Downtown Revitalization Project and various other COS master planning efforts, construction to replace and repair buildings affected by the February 2019 downtown fire, and a proposed Best Western remodel.

         Draft EA Errors
Several contradictions are made within the EA text, which highlight the need for a more thorough analysis. And, references needed to support assumptions or conclusions are often lacking or are all-together missing. Here are a few:
 While the EA asserts that the project need is based on the limited ability of existing infrastructure to handle the continued growth of freight rail service demands in the BNSF northern tier; it also asserts that the project would not increase or change rail traffic volumes on BNSFs northern tier...
 The EA eliminated socioeconomic impacts from review based on assumed minimal or no effect. Without citing any evidence, the EA asserts that the project would not impact businesses in the Sandpoint area. It also asserts that businesses within Sandpoint would temporarily benefit from the influx of economic activity during construction, yet no study of economic impacts is referenced.
An EIS would address these shortcomings by studying vehicle transportation and emergency response in the study area. An EIS would describe impacts on wait times at grade crossings and emergency response that could result from operation of the Proposed Action vs. the No-Action Alternative. Finally, an EIS would provide an opportunity to clarify, revise, or omit any EA statements that were made either without supporting evidence or with inappropriate inferences.

The increased number of train trips increases the risk of derailment and adversely impacts to the local economy and on local threatened species.
The railway conveys hazardous material, so a spill is likely, given recent history.

I do not believe the local infrastructure can handle the problems created by this application.

The Environmental Assessment Report (produce by the applicant - Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway) is biased, It contains many assumptions and several contradictions. It (and its producer) cannot be trusted, An independent investigation must be done..

An Environmental Impact Study is needed to properly assess the danger of a derailment to the community and the danger to threatened species. The project simply cannot proceed without a thorough understanding of consequences.

The possibility of derailment and subsequent pollution of our lake is just too great a risk. More trains over Bridge Street will negatively impact recreational activities at City Beach. Residents and visitors, children, trying to spend a beautiful day at City Beach will be subject to nearly constant screeching train noise and breathing in coal dust and diesel emissions while  theyre trying to enjoy swimming and playing at the lake. More trains logically means longer wait times at crossings. I dont see how Sandpoint benefits in any way from becoming over taken by the corporation BNFS. 114 trains blazing through our town each day will have a huge impact on the beauty, peace and clean air and puts our lake at risk. BNFS benefits financially of course. According to progressiverailroading.com for full-year 2018, BNSF reported operating income of $7.8 billion, up 7 percent, and total revenue of $23.9 billion, up 12 percent. Rail congestion is slowing their profits. So they want to expand. But how much is enough(?) Why should we sacrifice the beauty and the quality of life of our town so Warren Buffet/Berkshire Hathaway can make more more more money (?)

Regarding the Proposed Construction of Railroad Bridges Across Sand Creek and Lake Pend Oreille at Sandpoint, Bonner County, ID, please accept my comments:

As a resident of Spokane, Washington, I am very concerned about increasing the number of cargo trains that pass through my city.  It is already very evident to me that many of the trains convey coal, oil, and other hazardous materials.  If even more trains pass through Spokane, the likelihood of trains accidents and spills is much higher.

In addition to increased risks of derailments and adverse impacts to the Spokane River (and tributaries), even more trains will contribute to polluted air, increased wait times at crossings, and many other adverse impacts.

I have observed that many of the BNSF bridges have cracks and appear to need maintenance, and/or should be replaced.  What will even more train transits do to poorly maintained bridges?

   At the Davisville Road private crossing, blockages by waiting trains are common.  This is a danger with firefighters or police

   A second BNSF bridge crossing the lake will reduce the time and number of times when the trains need to stop on the

""The Lake Pend Oreille CHSU is essential to bull trout conservation because it is among the more secure and stable bull trout refugia across the range of the species and may provide a very important stronghold against potential extinction. Adfluvial bull trout comprise the predominant life history form present in the CHSU, and the CHSU has averaged over 800 bull trout redds annually over the last 10 years with a high of greater than 1,250 redds in recent years. Lake Pend Oreille not only provides important FMMO habitat to bull trout local populations in Lake Pend Oreille tributaries and Pend Oreille River tributaries but to bull trout populations in the Lower Clark Fork River CHSU. Bull trout local populations have not been recently
documented in Pend Oreille River tributaries that were known to be historically present. Reestablishing local populations that are broadly distributed throughout the CHSU has been identified as necessary for bull trout recovery (see Appendices 1 and 2 for more detailed information).""

In this report - it is clearly stated that Lake Pend Oreille is considered a 'core area' in the Bull Trout Recovery plane:
https://www.fws.gov/.../Bull_Trout.../Chapter3_Clark_Fork_River_Recovery_Unit_M...
""The goal of the bull trout recovery plan is to ensure the long-term
persistence of self-sustaining, complex, interacting groups of bull trout distributed throughout the species native range so that the species can be delisted.""

Furthermore, migrations of Bull Trout to the Clark Fork critical habitat subunit or that of tributaries such as Trestle Creek, must be ensured through studying any interruption in the emigration of these species which have been known to migrate up to 150 miles.
https://www.fs.fed.us/rm/pubs_other/rmrs_2006_horan_d001.pdf

Given the construction of the bridge will disturb the sediments of the mouth of the Pend Oreille River and Sand Creek and impact turbidity downstream, a thorough study on the potential for disturbing habitat and spawning locations in the associated tributaries and at Lake Pend Oreille is necessary in order to comply with the endangered species act and all critical habitat requirements.",,,,,,,

I have lived in Bonner Co. for the last 41 years.  My husband  Les and I moved to the Sandpoint area while I was pregnant with our daughter who is now 41 years old and our 2 1/2 year old son who is now 43.

We started our own business, a insulation business and did all the energy programs backed by the government and in our area was run through Northern Lights.  I stayed home until our daughter started school and then started working for the Apline Ski shop owned by the original owner and his wife.  I helped manage the shop up at Schweitzer and in town.  Our family received  wonderful season pass discounts for me working at the ski shop and i got to ski free.  Because of Les's work, working with all the contractors in the area and me working at the ski shop and being active in our local church and in the schools we new everyone in town.  We could say Hi to everyone.  It was small town and we loved the fishing, skiing, hiking, working, gardening here.  We were never rich and sometimes strugled but life was good.

We originally moved here from Utah but I am originally from Minnesota and my husband from California.  I pushed for the life style I wanted our family to have, similar to mine in Minnesota, we got it here in Idaho, minus massvie mosquitos and humidity.

When we first came through in 1970 on our way to Canada for some classes my husband was taking we fell in love with the beauty and the pristine nature of this area. We are adamantly opposed to a double bridge across Lake Pend Oreille. We think it will be devastating to the area not only from an environmental perspective, what if theres a spell into the lake? But from the perspective of tourism, which this county relies heavily on. Noise, pollution, traffic. There are already too many trains as it is. We live very close to the tracks and this will adversely affect our lives, as well as many others.

My husband has read and studied up on the impacts this has on the enviroment, childrens lungs, brains, our lungs.  I could go on and on but I wont. I hope you have read this and I thank you if you have.  I am 68 years old, moved there when I was 28.  We love Sandpoint, how long have you lived in this area?  Why do you live here?

Please think carefully and I pray you try to stop this from going through.

My name is Liz Iha and I'm a resident of Sandpoint in Bonner County, ID. Thank you for taking this time to receive public comment on these proposed bridges. Due to the time in which we live, when protection of our ecosystems and environment is not just good sense, it's imperative, I believe it's absolutely critical that a full EIS is performed for this project.  

Also, I believe that before BNSF adds more rails across Sand Creek and Lake Pend Oreille that they take care of a couple things first:
1. The city of Sandpoint be listed as a quiet zone. This means that for each crossing in Sandpoint, BNSF installs the technology that will minimize if not completely negate the use of train horns. Extremely loud train horns cause undue stress in this city as they are used at any time and any hour. 1am, 3am, 5am, etc. These additional bridges would most certainly result in additional trains and thus additional train horns blaring. 
2. Cap coal cars. Coal dust and lost coal is an issue and environmental hazard. https://www.sierraclub.org/planet/2017/04/bnsf-derailed-train-company-must-finally-pay-price-for-dumping-coal-washington-s

The current Sandpoint Connector Proposal Report fails to adequately address the impacts of the project on the City of Sandpoint, the navigational safety of boaters, and the access of residents to Lake Pend Oreille and the city water system. 
Construction of the bridges within Sandpoint and across Lake Pend Oreille will have a significant impact on quality of life for residents, businesses, visitors, boaters, and the tourism industry.  Over 12,000 visitors come to Sandpoint each year, pumping $43,000,000 into the local economy.  In summer, the focal point of this industry is Lake Pend Oreille and the City Beach. The Draft EA plan would include the building of two temporary and two permanent bridges each over Sand Creek and Lake Pend Oreille, as well as an overpass above Bridge Street, which is the access to City Beach. I will focus on three concerns:  navigational safety, noise from pile driving, and closure of Bridge Street.
a)	Navigational SafetyAt the end of the described project there would be two permanent bridges over Sand Creek and Lake Pend Oreille; during construction there would be an additional work bridge at each site. Drawings in Draft EA: Appendix A, Drawings 8 & 9, show that when the project is completed, the posts/piles on the two permanent bridges at Sand Creek and the posts/piles on the two permanent bridges on Lake Pend Oreille will NOT be aligned. In Appendix A and in the Draft Narrative we learn that the new bridge across the Lake will have navigational spans between posts/piles that are twice as wide as the spans on the old bridge (3.9). New bridge piers would align approximately with every other pier on the old bridge (3.9). (EA p. 58, hard copy). Thus, a boater navigating through the middle of two posts on the new bridge, would be directly and immediately confronted with a post on the old bridge, since the posts do not align. The two bridges would be only 50 feet apart (EA, p.20 hard copy), giving boaters only a few seconds to react, probably not enough time to even turn their boats. Boaters use this route at night with limited visibility. In addition, there is no description of how the working bridge posts would align with those of the two permanent bridges. This is a prescription for disaster. An EIS is needed to clarify and resolve this safety situation.
b)	NoiseThe most disruptive noise from construction will come from the driving of 1,100 bridge piles for the temporary and permanent bridges. For the Sand Creek Permanent Bridge located in the City, there will be 64 piles driven with 1,200 strikes per pile; for the Lake PO permanent bridge there would be 288 piles with 1,600 piles at 101-110 decibels. Fifty-five decibels is the measured ambient noise; 75 decibels is the threshold for human harm. The EA estimates that two piles per day can be driven. That means that up to 3,200 strikes at harmful hearing levels could be driven each day for up to a year and half for the Lake PO Bridge. Residents within a mile radius of the pile driving will experience the noise as louder than the ambient noise around them. In addition, humans are affected not only by the loudness of noise, but also by the pitch and frequency of noise, whose effects are not analyzed in this Draft. The Draft states that bubble curtains will be used to reduce noise; these work to reduce noise that is below the water; it is unclear how much noise is reduced. An EIS is needed to better assess the effects of noise on aquatic and shoreline creatures, human residents, and daily quality of life for the duration of the construction project. The EA provides numerous charts and narration related to construction noise (p. 17-24, 50, 57-58, 68, all hard copy)
c)	Bridge Street ClosureThe Bridge Street Closure is only casually mentioned as a possibility on EA pages 79 and 87, hard copy, yet even a temporary closure would cause critical disruption. (Page 11 also mentions potential of congestion in this area due to equipment). Bridge Street currently has parallel highway and railroad overpasses; the Draft EA proposes to add another rail overpass. Any closure of Bridge Street will cut off access to: City Beach, Sandpoint Water Treatment Plant, City Marina, RV Park, Seasons Condominiums, Best Western Inn, and the Amtrak station. Bridge Street narrows at the overpass, with concrete supports on either side; beyond that is water; there is no possible alternate route. The EA does not address the frequency, duration, or timing of Bridge Street closure(s), or its impact on the population, the vital tourist industry, public access to Lake Pend Oreille, access to the city water system, or residential access to homes. An EIS is needed to further assess the necessity for closure and what actions (if any) can be taken to maintain access.

Appendix F: Biological Assessment, Sandpoint Junction Connector Project

	 Bull Trout

In this EA and its Appendix F: Biological Impacts, BNSF concedes that fish within the construction impact zone may be harmed and killed, with damage to internal organs (Hard Copy, p.55), loss of food supply (Hard Copy, p.58), and an increase in predation (Hard Copy, p. 57). In the EA, these effects are dismissed as short term, only affecting a small portion of the bull trout population (Hard Copy, p.84), whose loss will be mitigated by the increase in bull trout population when the USACE Albeni Falls Dam Fish Passage Project on the Pend Oreille River is completed; however, fish from this Project would need to pass directly through the construction zone to migrate into Lake Pend Oreille.

Bull trout are designated as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act. Bull trout migrate between Lake PO and its mountain creek and river tributaries to spawn and rear juveniles; thus the interface of rivers and creeks with the Lake are critical areas for survival.  A Critical Habitat Map (EA Hard Copy p. 54; Appendix F, Hard Copy p. 42) shows the migration patterns of fish between the PO River, Pack River, the Clark Fork River along with their myriad creeks and the northern area of Lake PO. The entire northern area of Lake Pend Oreille is designated as a Critical Habitat Area for the bull trout (Appendix F: Biological Assessment, Hard Copy p. 41).  Figure 6: Action Area Map (Appendix F, Hard Copy, p. 30) shows that the construction zone for the Sandpoint Connector Project overlaps the critical habitat zone of the bull trout (Figure 8: Bull Trout Threshold Distances (Appendix F, Hard Copy, p. 50).  This is corroborated by Appendix F: Construction Timing Table: BNSF Sandpoint Junction Connector: Key Element Construction Timing with Bull Trout Migration (PDF page 122), which shows that the construction project will interfere with fish migration (and thus, spawning as well) for a four-year period.
 
What the EA does not address is that the construction impact zone is in the critical migration paths of bull trout between the Pend River and Lake Pend Oreille. This includes fish currently entering the PO River from the East River Basin of the Priest River (EA, Hard Copy p. 53) and the migration path of fish that will be released from the Albeni Fish Passage Project. Bull trout also migrate in and out of Lake Pend Oreille from several rivers/creeks just to the east of the construction zone (Appendix F: Hard Copy p.40). Thus it appears that the construction impact zone may have a significant effect on the migrating bull trout population, their life cycle, and their ability to spawn and produce future generations; this issue is not addressed in the EA. An EIS is needed to address the overlap of the Bull Trout Critical Habitat Zone, the Bull Trout Migration Zone, and the Sandpoint Connector Construction Zone.

Christopher Jaufmann

I am writing in response to the proposed Burlington Northern Santa Fe (BNSF) Bridge Construction Project. Docket ID: USCG-2018-1085

The Spokane Riverkeepers mission is to protect and restore the health of the Spokane River watershed and to defend our right to a clean Spokane River.  The Spokane Riverkeeper advocates for clean water and educates the public about issues that impact our waters. Citizens are encouraged to get involved and stay connected to their Spokane River, one of the regions most valuable natural assets.  

This proposed project would create numerous direct, indirect and cumulative impacts affecting the city of Sandpoint, Bonner County, Idaho, and for the down rail region in the Spokane Valley and the City of Spokane, Washington.  

1.	If constructed the proposed bridges would create potential impacts for species listed under the Endangered Species Act (ESA).  Bull trout are threatened under the ESA and no longer occupy much of their former range in the interior mountain west.  The proposed fill as well as the potential of trains spilling coal and/or oil under transport pose grave dangers to these already vulnerable populations of native fish in Lake Pend Oreille.  Additionally, when completed, the bridges will exacerbate the potential impacts to interior redband trout living in the Spokane River, down rail in the Spokane Valley.  These species of native trout are listed as a species if concern in Washington State and any spill of coal or oil could irreparably damage redband trout populations and their long term habitat.

2.	The traffic that is added to the down rail lines in Washington State have other cumulative impacts.  There is an increased risk of an oil spill over the Spokane Rathdrum Prairie Aquifer. It should be noted that a spill into Lake Pend Oreille could pose pollution to our Spokane Rathdrum Prairie aquifer which draws some water from Lake Pend Oreille.  Additionally, down rail, this aquifer would be vulnerable to spilled oil as it is very shallow, and protected only by a shallow lens of gravel in most places.  This aquifer has been designated by the  Environmental Protection Agency as a sole source of drinking water for the entire region.  A spill of Bakken crude oil or Alberta diluted bitumen oil could cause irreparable harm to this valuable community resource.  Increasing rail traffic only increases the odds of such an accident.

3.	Additionally, the increased traffic that this project would bring, puts our communities at risk. Spokane City fire fighting officials have identified deep concerns with the transportation of crude oil by rail through these down-rail communities.  An oil spill in down town Spokane that catches fire, presents a situation for which there is no immediate or appropriate response.  Many citizens would be put at risk in such a scenario.   Washington State has identified oil spilling by rail a significant potential in the permitting process for other west coast oil by rail projects.

Spokane Riverkeeper is asking that you evaluate BNSFs proposal as a serious risk to the environment region wide.  It also presents localized impacts to the areas under construction at Lake Pend Oreille.  As such, we request that a full Environmental Impact Statement be written and considered for this proposal and that it consider impacts to down rail environments and communities.

Thank you for the opportunity to comment.

When a train comes by the sound is deafening but the biggest problem I have is that debris is dropping, flying off the rail cars and splashing all around me. One must pull under the bridge to avoid being hit by  debris including coal chunks. The increased environmental regulations are ignored largely by BNSF. Oil cars are supposed to be pushed, not pulled for safety reasons and most often they are pulled. This is reflected by the fact that there is no engine noise coming from the rear locomotives most often. Night time transport is often used illegally for unsecured loads.

At the bridge location this river has significant navigational issues especially in high traffic summer months and during high volume water flows.The addition of another bridge will increase navigation hazards by multiples. It's not a matter of if an accident willl happen it is when and how often it will occur. 

A full environmental study impact statement should be required by BNSF to completely identify all hazards environmental and navigational so that proper risk management solutions and disaster preparedness. The second bridge is being built primarily to accommodate increased loads of highly toxic chemicals and further review is maximum.",,,,,,,

The replacement of railroad bridges across Lake Pend Oreille and Sand Creek on the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railroad Company Hi-Line will relieve a known chokepoint in the mainline rail system and the project needs to proceed.  The rail traffic through Sandpoint, Idaho, the largest city in Bonner County, is an important economic stimulus and vital link for interstate and foreign commerce.  

The proposed steel and concrete structures over the water will be constructed with the most modern safety technology that can be applied to modern railroading.  This is in contrast to the existing 115-year old bridge which has been updated several times but is now obsolete.

Many federal, state and local laws and regulations govern and protect aquatic, riparian and terrestrial areas and the plants, animals and fishes that inhabit them.  Those relevant to this project include the Federal and State Endangered Species Acts, Fishery Management Acts, Marine Mammal Protections and Migratory Bird Treaty Acts.   

It is known that pollutants from rail roadbeds include fuel, oil, grease, industrial lubricants; heavy metals such as copper and zinc and land erosion.  The design and placement of the railroad bridge and advanced stormwater systems will help mitigate any pollutants released into the environment.

The plan to modernize this railroad bridge system makes good sense.  There is an urgent need for it to proceed to help ensure that the regions economy remains strong, a traffic chokepoint is relieved and modern controls are put in place through the design and build process so that various pollution concerns are addressed.

There is already dust and exhaust going into the lake.

Unless you can guarantee there will not be an increase in rail traffic, and that you have a plan and reserved resources to deal with an accident, we are not in agreement to the second rail line. Additional rail traffic causes further polluting and putting our lake and surrounding environment at risk, to the cost of our community. There would be additional dust, exhaust, rail crossing delays, and noise.

The attendant bridge tender has a duty to ensure safety of both highway and marine traffic on this span over the Duwamish Waterway.

The proposal to not have a bridge tender at the span during certain hours is worrisome as it may lead to unintended consequences.  The current plan seems to contradict City of Seattle opening requirements that the bridge openings should be requested no less than one hour prior to the opening.  Emergency openings could very well be delayed.  Fog conditions may require an audible warning which may not be sounded if a bridge tender is not present.  In addition, the overnight bridge tender would immediately be on scene to report any accident or emergency on the four 11-foot driving lanes, sidewalks, bike lanes or to any bridge support.  A presence on the bridge also allows for a semblance of public safety or security.

Filling the bridge tender position from 11:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. should be explored as the public expects a certain predictability to operations so there is no question or ambiguity between bridge operations, vehicle and marine traffic.   Each bridge is unique, and this trunnion double leaf bascule bridge is no exception.  It seems that there should be qualified bridge tenders available to fill this position and maintain the public safety element or the benefits outweigh the costs if that is the real issue.  

Additional rule changes to 33 CFR 117.1041, in my opinion, are not in the public interest.

To establish the best security measurements possible its necessary that the Coast Guard can access all the areas in and around the event space. Therefore its not helpful if vessels other than the participants of the event are on the water that day. Regarding the safety, for participants and non-participants of the event, I think its absolutely supportable to prohibit all other vessels on the water. Its a reasonable measure for a specific time frame and for the safety of all. Making that happen, all attendees can focus on the event and dont have to worry about safety issues more than necessary.   ",,,,,,,

Dear Ma'am/Sir:  

This letter is in response to the Coast Guard's request for comments regarding the proposal to establish a 48 hour time limit in Anchorage area B in Bolivar Roads (Docket Number USCG 2019-0028).  

As background, the Houston Pilots is a voluntary association of 100 Texas state licensed ship Pilots.  Houston Pilots are commissioned by the Governor of the state of Texas to safeguard the interests of the State and citizens of Harris County by facilitating the safe and efficient movement of vessels in Texas state waters, which includes the Bolivar Roads anchorages and the Houston Ship Channel (HSC).  Last year the Houston Pilots safely conducted nearly 19,000 ship movements along the HSC and over 1600 movements to or from the Bolivar Roads anchorage.  

The Bolivar Roads anchorage is a relatively small and busy anchorage located inside the jetties leading to the ports of Houston, Galveston, and Texas City.  Time limits for vessels using these relatively low capacity anchorages ensure that vessels with the most pressing logistical and husbandry needs get access to the inshore anchorage in a safe, fair and predictable manner.  

For this reason, Houston Pilots supports the proposed rulemaking imposing time limitations on vessels using Anchorage B.

  The 180-day temporary deviation should be made permanent on September 9, 2019, the last day of the deviation period, this change better balancing the needs of marine and rail traffic. 

  Additionally the Coast Guard should investigate: 1) expanding the two-hour advance notice to 24 hours, as requested by Amtrak in its December 4, 2018 letter; and 2) eliminating the provision of bridge openings for tide restricted commercial vessels between 7 a.m. and 8 a.m. and between 5 p.m. and 6 p.m.

  The hard statistics of extremely infrequent vessel traffic requiring the opening of Portal Bridge (an average of one vessel round trip every 6 weeks from January 2017 through October 2018) and the extremely frequent passage of trains and passengers across the bridge during the two five-hour periods of closure (267 of 455 daily trains and 149,000 of 197,000 daily one-way passengers, both in October 2017) provide the quantitative support for these changes.

As a part of our purview, trans-Hudson transit mobility is important to us and to our constituents (NJ Transit's rail riders, as well as their towns and counties).  That includes continued smooth operation of trains over Portal Bridge, especially during peak-commuting hours, when large numbers of rail riders depend on NJ Transit and Amtrak trains to take them to their offices and other destinations in a timely manner.

The following material forms a portion the content of a letter sent concerning this matter, dated December 4, 2019.  We repeat parts of that content, to fit the limit of characters allowed, in this format.

DAVID PETER ALAN
Chair, Lackawanna Coalition



LACKAWANNA COALITION
Box 283
Millburn, N.J. 07041
www.lackawannacoalition.org


	The Lackawanna Coalition is a not-for-profit organization that advocates for better transit along the Morris & Essex, Montclair-Boonton and Gladstone rail lines of New Jersey Transit (NJT) and connecting transit.  Our constituents include thousands of commuters on the above-mentioned lines, as well as thousands more on the Northeast Corridor (NEC) and North Jersey Coast Line (NJCL) of NJT.

	We agree with the proposal for closing Portal Bridge as stated.

	However, we believe that the Coast Guard should strengthen this rule in the future, as follows:
	We call for the bridge closures during the specified periods to be mandatory and not permissive.
	We strenuously object to the proposed exception for draft-limited vessels.
	We call for a requirement of at least 24 hours' notice when any bridge opening is requested.
	We also call for the ""closed"" periods to start one hour earlier; at 4:00 a.m. and 2:00 p.m.

	Rather than present extensive background information, we refer to and incorporate by reference an article entitled ""Hey!  Wanna Buy a Bridge?"" written by your commenter herein and posted on the web site of Railway Age, www.railwayage.com on June 18, 2019, as part of a series about Gateway.

	In that spirit, we endorse in principle the decision to keep Portal Bridge closed during the peak-commuting periods of 5:00 to 10:00 am and 3:00 to 8:00 pm on weekdays, so trains can pass freely over the bridge during those times.  We believe that the restriction at issue has substantially reduced the risk of significant delays to thousands of commuters and other riders into New York City, and some going in the other direction.  The results have been improved operations on the railroad, improved productivity for the riders, and consequent benefit to the regional economy.

	We strongly recommend in principle that the first sentence of proposed rule 117.723(e), which states: ""The draw of the Amtrak Portal Bridge, mile 5.0, need not open for the passage of vessel traffic from 5:00 a.m. To 10:00 a.m. and from 3 p.m. to 8 p.m."" be implemented, as modified here.  We also recommend that the phrase ""need not open"" should be changed to the stronger ""shall not open"" to indicate that allowing trains to pass freely during these periods is mandatory, rather than merely permissive.  

	We strongly object to the rest of the proposed rule, which would allow tide-restricted vessels to call for bridge openings between 7:00 and 8:00 in the morning and 5:00 and 6:00 in the afternoon.  We do not know how many such ""tide-restricted vessels"" are registered with the Coast Guard in the region, but we do know that bridge openings for maritime traffic occur only about once every six weeks on average.  We also know of no such openings during these hours within the period of March through September, 2019.  Other openings relate to maintenance and testing, which are never required when the railroad is busy.  In fact, those activities can be performed when railroad traffic is at its lowest level.  Without that objectionable loophole, even purported ""tide-restricted vessels"" would still have 14 hours available to call for bridge openings: five hours during the mid-day and nine hours during the evening and at night, and they would still have all day on week-ends.

	Therefore, the Lackawanna Coalition calls for continuation of the current policy of keeping Portal Bridge closed at least during the hours of 5 to 10 in the morning and 3 to 8 p.m.; preferably beginning one hour earleir.  We call for stronger language to make that policy mandatory, and we strongly object to the proposal to allow certain vessels priority during the peak of railroad commuting time, both in the morning and the late afternoon.  We also call for 24 hours' notice for any opening.

									Yours very sincerely,

I do not support the changes proposed by the Towboat and Harbor Carriers Association of N.Y./N.J.

The USCG's ""temporary deviation to test the proposed change to the bridge's operating schedule and determine whether a permanent change to the schedule is necessary to better balance the needs of marine and rail traffic,"" was a great success, with no publicized vessel delays and no publicized train delays, a marked improvement from 2018, the year before the temporary deviation, when there were three separate occasions when tens of thousands of rail passengers were delayed due to bridge openings.

Quantitative support for the USCG's proposed changes in Portal Bridge Operating Regulations is very clear: extremely infrequent vessel traffic requiring the opening of Portal Bridge (an average of only one vessel round trip every 6 weeks from January 2017 through October 2018, reduced to less than half of that rate to one request an average of every 40 days from March 14, 2019 through July 12, 2019 - 9.125/year) and the extremely frequent passage of trains and passengers across the bridge during the two five-hour periods of closure (263 of 441 daily trains as of Thursday, December 5, 2019) and 149,000 of 197,000 daily one-way passengers (as of October 2017).

On an annual basis, the ratio of current passenger revenue train movements across Portal Bridge compared to recent bridge openings for vessel movements is more than 11,000 to one (103,400 trains/9.125 vessels=11,332).

Proposal:
I suggest that the USCG's proposed permanent Portal Bridge Operating Regulations at 33 CFR 117.723(e), be revised as follows: 
          The draw of the Amtrak Portal Bridge, mile 5.0, at Little Snake Hill, New Jersey, need not open for the passage of vessel traffic from 4 a.m. to 10 a.m. and from 2 p.m. to 8 p.m. At all other times the bridge shall open on signal if at least 48-hour advance notice is given.

If my suggested changes in the USCG's permanent Portal Bridge Operating Regulations are not incorporated at the end of this comment period, I request that a new test deviation period with opening regulations that incorporate all my suggested changes be initiated as soon as legally possible.

Going further:
In parallel with that new test deviation period, I propose that the USCG initiate an investigation into permanently leaving Portal Bridge closed, with an agreement by Amtrak to replace it with a new fixed bridge that increases vessel clearance at high tide from the current 23 feet to 25 feet. 

Thank you for this opportunity to comment.

My only question is why is a regulation needed in the first place. I understand that this race could be a hazard to people on the waterway, but is there no way they can be relegated to the edge, or there simply be stated times where people can move through.

TO THE US COAST GUARD FOR RI/MA WIND ENERGY
AREA ACCESS ROUTE (TRANSIT) STUDY
APRIL 14, 2019
COMMENTS IDENTIFIED BY DOCKET NUMBER:  USCG-2019-0131

THE GOAL OF THIS STUDY IS TO ENHANCE NAVIGATIONAL SAFETY BY EXAMINING EXISTING MARITIME TRANSITING ROUTES AND WATERWAY USES.  THE COMMERCIAL FISHERIES CENTER OF RI REPRESENTS ALL TYPES OF VESSELS (COMMERCIAL FISHING, CHARTER, RECREATIONAL & SAILING YACHTS) THAT WILL TRANSIT THROUGH THE RI/MA WEA.  OUR CONCERNS CENTER AROUND THE TRANSIT LANES LOCATION AND WIDTH OF THE LANES.  HUNDREDS OF FISHING VESSELS (TRAWLERS, LOBSTER & CRAB VESSELS, SCALLOPERS, GILLNETTERS & LONGLINERS) FROM RI, MA, CT, NY, WILL TRANSIT THROUGH THESE WEA TO THEIR TRADITIONAL FISHING GROUNDS AND RETURN TO THEIR HOME PORTS.  THEY WILL REQUIRE THE SHORTEST AND SAFEST TRANSIT LANES THROUGH THESE OFFSHORE WIND FARMS.  
CONCERNS AND NEEDS:
1.	NORTH & SOUTH, EAST & WEST AND NORTHWEST TO SOUTHEAST TRANSIT LANES.
2.	BEST OBSERVED DATA WOULD BE THE VMS TRACKING.  AIS IS LIMITED, IN TIME (2016 TO PRESENT) AND VESSELS 65 AND GREATER.
3.	TRANSIT LANE WORKSHOPS HAVE PRODUCED INDUSTRYS PREFERRED TRANSIT LANES VIA AN INDUSTRY CONSENSUS (MFWG).
4.	INDUSTRY HAS CONSISTENTLY DEMANDED 4-MILE-WIDE TRANSIT LANES TO NAVIGATE SAFELY.
5.	4-MILE-WIDE TRANSIT LANE RATIONALE; OSW DEVELOPERS REGARDLESS OF THE DETERMINED WIDTH WILL LINE THE EDGES WITH TURBINES, FORCING MOST PRUDENT NAVIGATOR TO ESTABLISH A  TO 1 MILE BUFFER FROM THE FENCE OF TURBINES.  AT 2 MILES THAT WILL HAVE THE ENTIRE FLEET NAVIGATING IN TWO-WAY TRAFFIC RIGHT DOWN THE MIDDLE OF THE TRANSIT LANE, HIGHLY SPECULATIVE AND DANGEROUS.  THE OFFSHORE FLEET THAT FISHES MULTIPLE DAYS (5-12 DAYS) NORMALLY LEAVES AND FISHES IN FAIR TO MARGINAL WEATHER CONDITIONS, BUT USUALLY IS DRIVEN HOME BY HEAVY WEATHER FORECAST AND CONDITIONS.  HIGH WINDS AND SEAS, LOW VISIBILITY, SNOW, TIDE CONDITIONS ARE CONTRIBUTING FACTORS ALONG WITH THE KNOWN BACK SCATTER FROM OUR RADARS, ARE ALL A RECEIPE FOR DISASTER IN A 2-MILE-WIDE TRANSIT LANE OR LESS.  ADDITIONALLY, ANY LOSS OF POWER AND OR PROPULSION, IMPEDING STEERAGE AND VESSEL MANUEVERABILITY AND LAYING DEAD IN THE WATER IN A 2-MILE-WIDE TRANSIT LANE WILL ONLY TAKE 10  30 MINUTES BEFORE COLLIDING WITH A TURBINE FOUNDATION CAUSING LOSS OF VESSEL AND LIVES.  AT 4 MILES WIDE THERE IS AMPLE TIME TO DEPLOY AN ANCHOR, TRAWL DOOR OR DREDGE TO SLOW THE VESSELS DRIFT UNTIL ASSISTANCE ARRIVES.  THE LIMITED TRANSIT LANES WILL FORCE A MYRIAD OF ALL CLASSES OF VESSELS TO TRANSIT THROUGH THESE DESIGNATED LANES, SMALL AND SAILING VESSELS WITH LIMITED LIGHTING AND VISIBILITY FOR THE LARGER VESSELS TO OBSERVE AND MOST DISCERNING ARE THE HIGH SPEED VESSELS MOTORING AT 20  40 KTS, UNBEKNOWST TO RULES OF THE ROAD (PORT  PORT) INCREASING THE POTENTIAL OF MORE COLLISION AT SEA, LASTLY, SHIPPING LANES HAVE BEEN DETERMINED BY THE USCG BASED ON SIZE, SPEED AND FREQUENCY OF TRAVEL WITH 4 MILE WIDE LANES THE ACCEPTABLE WIDTH.  ALTHOUGH, IN THE SHIPPING LANES THERE ARENT A FENCE OF TURBINES ALONG THAT 4 MILE PERIMETER, THERE IS FLEXIBILITY FOR ONCOMING TRAFFIC AND HEAVY WEATHER CONDITIONS, BUT NOT THROUGH AN OFFSHORE WIND FARM. 
6.	FISHING ACTIVITY (MOBILE & FIXED) MUST NOT BE PROHIBITED WITHIN TRANSIT LANES
7.	TRANSIT LANES MUST HAVE PROPER MARKINGS AND LIGHTING IN ORDER TO VISUALLY NAVIGATE A SAFE PASSAGE WAY
8.	NEW CHARTS WITH DETERMINED TRANSIT LANES HIGHLIGHTED MADE AVAILABLE FOR MARINERS
9.	US COAST GUARD SEARCH AND RESCUE, MEDEVACS, DEWATERING PUMP DELIVERY AND ANY ADDITIONAL ASSISTANCE MUST ESTABLISH A NEW PROTOCOL IN THE WIND ENERGY AREAS.  MAY IMPEDE THE ABILITY FOR AT SEA ASSETS TO ASSIST, MOST NOTABLY HELO ACTIVITY DURING MARGINAL TO HEAVY WEATHER CONDITIONS AND LOW VISIBILITY.  THE HELO WILL NAVIGATE AT AN ALTITUDE OF 500 OR LESS, RIGHT AT THE LEVEL OF THE TURBINES, DEMANDING MULTIPLE SETS OF EYES TO AVOID A COLLISION.  THE ABILITY TO STOP THE TURBINES IN MINUTES HAS SOME MERIT, BUT, DOES BECOME ANOTHER HINDERANCE IN THEIR NAVIGATION WHICH MAY BECOME A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR IN ABORTING THE HELO AS AN ASSET.  
CORDIALLY,

We agree with and emphasize the comments you have already received from the Commercial Fisheries Center of RI. We specifically want to re-emphasize the importance of a 4-mile wide transit lane needed for the safe transit of all vessels and the likely limitations of USCG search and rescue within a Wind Energy Area. Transit lanes need to be specifically designed with these limitations in mind for the safety of all mariners that may transit the area.

However, and more importantly, we also want to ask that these transit lanes not only be studied and determined through the MARIPARS process but also that any USCG recommendations (including recommended transit lanes width, routes, and any other special considerations) that result from the MARIPARS be incorporated into rulemaking and the appropriate international agreements so that these important safety measures are binding on BOEM and on all future development within the wind energy area.  

In addition, we would also ask the USCG to tell BOEM to halt all development of all the Wind Energy Areas off the Atlantic coast (including the NY Bight) until all the PARS have been completed. To not have enforceable transit routes determined and mapped before the design and construction of any Wind Energy Area is simply putting the cart before the horse. The energy companies should have that information before they bid on a lease area and certainly before they submit a COP. Without that information, they are likely to waste time and resources pursuing designs that will inevitably endanger mariners. Transit lanes must be safely designed and routed in a comprehensive fashion so that they are all coordinated throughout the NE Lease Complex and beyond. The challenges of the NY BIght are similar to the NE complex and close enough geographically that any transit lanes in the NY Bight should also be coordinated with the lanes of the New England lease complex.",,,,,,,

I am writing on behalf of the two New Bedford Massachusetts FV Gabby G and FV Megan Marie for the Coast Guards MA/RI wind energy area port access study. These vessels frequently navigate through WEA to get to fishing grounds to the south and east of the area.  As currently proposed the WEA will be a hazard to navigation and could end or curtail the ability of these vessels to utilize their traditional fishing grounds.  
Without the implementation of north/south and east/west transit lanes as proposed by RODA offshore vessels will not be able to safely get to port in a timely manner, which will reduce access to fishing opportunities.  One such example would be the Illex Squid fishery that takes place on the edge of the continental shelf south of the WEA.  Vessels in this fishery only have 48hours from when the first squid are caught until they must be offloaded in order prevent them from spoiling.  With a majority of these vessels offloading in New Bedford if there is not a direct line of transit to and from this port then the entire fishery could be wiped out.
 I must urge the Coast Guard to recommend that BOEM require the implementation of said transit lanes with a width of at least 3 nautical miles in order to ensure the safety of vessel traffic. The build out of the WEA will create natural bottlenecks and force all current vessel traffic into these lanes, thus transit lanes should be developed to allow a large number of vessels to safely navigate at the same time including in heavy seas and poor conditions, for that will be when they are needed most.  Vessel safety should be the number one priority in this project, with an adequate number, and width, of transit lanes to ensure this.  In addition all turbines should be required to have AIS and lighting equipment with backups to help aid in navigating these areas.  To emphasize this point there was recently an allision in Europe between a wind turbine service vessel and a turbine because the lighting equipment on the turbine had malfunctioned. 
	Id also like to request that the Coast Guard conduct a port access study for the proposed New York and New Jersey WEAs with the hope that transit lanes can be developed prior to the leasing of these areas.

Thank you for your time and consideration,

The commercial fishing industry is important, and/but quite small in Rhode Island. We should do what is reasonable to accommodate their needs, such as placing turbines in E-W arrays. I do not think we can afford to move from 1 mile to 4 mile spacing between them, and still produce the energy we need for our region.

Fishing in and safely navigating through the wind farm area is only possible with prudent one mile spacing of the wind turbines, in a uniform grid pattern. It is also imperative to include a series of 4 mile wide traffic separation lanes that will separate opposing streams of traffic, accommodate traditional fishing operations, and most importantly, allow for the Coast Guard to perform search and rescue operations
The current planning for the adjacent projects in the Mass/RI WEA have different turbine layouts, no traffic separation navigational corridors, and do not align the orientation of their wind turbines.  This will make it impossible to safely navigate through and fish in the wind farms
Based on data, annual vessel transit through the Mass/RI WEA range from 13,000 to 46,900. This does not include the many vessels that now transit the area without AIS or VMS units.  This is a average of 128 transits per day on average. However, during the summer months, this increased to 512 per day! During times of heavy fog or rain, transiting safely without a 4 mile wide traffic separation lane will be impossible. Wind farm developers have stated that due to navigational risks, vessels would likely go around the wind farm area. Coastal pilot associations have stated large shipping traffic as well as tug and barge traffic will avoid going through the wind farms and will go around, predominantly to the west of the wind farm area. This will create a funneling into a narrow area just west of the wind farm area, with the transit of as many of 500 vessels per day during the summer months. The passing of so many vessels in such a narrow zone, is inherently dangerous and creates a huge potential for collisions.  Requiring vessels to transit around the wind farm area is not practical, particularly for smaller vessels in adverse weather conditions such as gale or storms force winds and icing conditions. This might cause a more risky transit and require vessels transit further toward Open Ocean and away from safe haven. Economic impacts with the additional distance include increased fuel costs and loss of valuable fishing time.
My experience is that at certain times, there can be 20 to 40 squid, mackerel, butterfish, monkfish, and crab and lobster vessels fishing in or transiting through the wind farm area at any one time. There will also be an increase in vessel traffic associated with the construction of and support of the wind turbines.
Potential for interference with radar will also create difficult issues. False targets, multiple reflections, and ghost targets will all make transit through the wind farms dangerous.  The Coast Guard report recommends transiting through the wind farms in daylight and good weather. This comment shows the lack of understanding in commercial fishing operations. Typically, fishing vessels travel through the wind farm area at night, often following departing adverse weather conditions and heading back home through also at night during adverse weather conditions. If we waited for good weather, we would never go fishing.
The Coast Guard initiates about 10 search and rescue operations in the wind farm area per year. Wind and adverse weather conditions may not allow for USCG assets to go into the wind farm area. Search and rescue capabilities may also be impacted by the presence of the wind turbines, particularly USCG helicopters.
Finally, it is only reasonable, that the fishing industry which has operated in and adjacent to the wind farm area for over 100 years, can expect to safely navigate in and across the wind farm area. To do so, it is imperative to include multiple 4 mile Traffic Separation Schemes. This will accommodate opposing traffic streams of traffic, allow for course alterations to avoid collisions with other vessels or wind turbines. It will provide vessels with a safe path to pass when overtaking other vessels. It will also allow for mechanical failures and emergency stopping, possibly allowing vessels disabled time to anchor and avoid drifting into wind turbines. Finally, it should be expected to be able to safely navigate through wind farms, where freedom of movement is restricted by the very existence of the wind farms during unfavorable meteorological conditions. If no Traffic Separation lanes are included and the Coast Guard states we must travel through the wind farms at our own risk, it is entirely possible our insurance companies will not allow us to do so.

I'm am writing you to express my concern with the Coast Guard recommendations.  The current plan has no allowance for shipping lanes, which in my option shows a disreguard for the safety of the men, woman and vessels that transit that area.   BOAM's own document suggest you take advantage of the fishermen, tug captains and shipping companies with years of experience transiting that area.  I can't find one that thinks it's a good idea to build these without properly planned shipping lanes. Can you?  Massachusetts Maritime Academy and the Pilot Association are recommending lanes.  Every fishing organization, fisherman and lay person with any knowledge of the area are recommending lanes.  Yet the Coast Guard recommendation is to transit through the wind farms in daylight and good weather.  That comment shows a lack of understanding of what happens in the real world of commercial fishing and shipping. I had to read it a couple of times to even believe what I was seeing.  Transiting through in any type of weather, gale force winds , heavy rain , snow or icing situations will be nearly impossible.  The amount of radar clutter and false echoes, never mind if there are other boats in the area will make it extremely difficult. You are asking smaller vessels that get caught in weather to not take a direct path to port, but to in best case run parallel to port and in some cases go further away from port.  For the life of me I can't understand an agency that is responsible for maintaining and enforcing navigational safety, would even consider not having shipping lanes in such a heavily congested wind farm?  We all have seen the data on the number of trips made in that area on a daily basis.

We are the last generation to look at open ocean, we all know these wind farms are going to change everything for better or worse.  I would encourage you to listen to the people who use and know that area, use some simple common sense.  Without those shipping lanes it's not a matter of if, but when will we have a major accident and may cost someone their life.

I believe it is logical to close the area where the triathlon will be taking class in order to preserve life and limb. I also think it is prudent to only allow vessels that have been approved by the Captain of Port. I think it would be wise if only the most necessary vessels were allowed to pass and they had to follow some temporary special procedures to ensure the safety of the competitors.  ",,,,,,,

Cameras or portable trackers that racers can were may be of value to those eager to watch. Hope this comment is of value.",,,,,,,

There are only 2 days per year during the swim portion of the triathlon when it will come into effect, making it relatively easy and reasonable to enforce. Additionally, it promotes the safety of everyone involved; Iron Man participants, event runners, safety and emergency personnel, and the general public. That goes for event security as well; the ability to control the area around this event allows the Coast Guard and DHS to maintain security and protect all around.  ",,,,,,,

We agree with this initiative and find it to be a unique problem that no one has yet addressed. As friends of athletes who have participated in the Ironman World Championship, we appreciate your thoughtfulness in caring for the athletes safety and success during practice and the race itself.

We suggest an enhancement to this regulation to improve the water conditions for the athletes swim as well as ensuring their safety. With the difficulty of swimming 2.4 miles in rough waters, we believe that it would be best to extend the hours of the regulation to 3:45 AM on both days in October. We found that this allotment of time would allow for 1) the waters to calm before the 2500 athletes compete and 2) the Coast Guard to have ample time to ensure the waters are clear of vessels and other personnel. We chose 3:45 AM as it is an hour before swim check-in begins. We find this will be useful especially in the first handful of years as the policy is being introduced to ensure effective communication to and understanding by impacted vessels. 

A point discussed within the proposed regulation was that this change should not have any significant economic implications. We believe extending the regulated time will have no additional impact on economic output or productivity. 

We appreciate your time and look forward to seeing this regulation put into action.",,,,,,,

Instead of the risk and cost of an experimental wireless remote operation, just establish a call-in period.  By making Tilleman bridge a 4 hour call-in, 24-7, and by making Walnut and Nitschke bridges a 4 hour call-in from 11 pm to 7 am, you could reduce the number of Bridge Tenders to 6 (half of what they have now).  You would still have a live Bridge Tender on each bridge when they require an opening.

In addition, a recent incident in Menasha with a bicyclist attempting to cross the open doors made national news (as it was videotaped).  This may save money, but it won't offer the safety required at these drawbridges.

The equipment and programming are still being troubleshot and the camera placements were influenced by convenience (existing poles) instead of desired results. 
     My major concern about going Full Remote is the recent decision by WISDOT to replace the current Green Bay City Bridge Tenders with Brown County Snow Plow Operators.  The plan calls for no overlap.  Therefore, 100 years of Bridge Tender experience will be replaced with 45 minutes if a lift needs to be done on any of the three bridges in Green Bay at midnight on December 1, 2019.  Making such a drastic personnel change this far into the process and on the tail end of the NPRM is irresponsible with respect to the public and maritime safety, and shows a certain disregard towards the Coast Guards approval process. 
     The four senior City Bridge Tenders were moved to Walnut Street Bridge in March, 2019 to facilitate and prepare for future Full Remote Operations.  The Tilleman Memorial and Ray Nitschke Memorial bridges have been operated remotely through the summer without major incidents.  There were a couple of gate crashes but that is a normal, infrequent occurrence.  Now, new operators, who have been trained in Sturgeon Bay and not Green Bay, will be responsible for all openings as of midnight on December 1, 2019.  
     As a current City Bridge Tender and a retired Coast Guard Officer, I strongly recommend that Full Remote Operations be delayed at least one more summer so these new operators can gain some experience.  Openings on a foggy morning, a dark rainy night, or a crowded Farmers Market evening are all situations the new operators should not be required or allowed to do alone for the first time.

    	Thank you for proposing to establish a temporary safety zone for safety reasons. The air show is an important event in the military. Therefore, considering the temporary safety zone also helps to boost up the morale. Also, your consideration of possible problems in terms of small entities and the relationship between federalism and Indian Tribal governments. 
You clarify that the impact of small entities would be insignificant according to 5 U.S.C. 605(b). Furthermore, as the environment perspective, according to the Department of Homeland Security Directive 023-01 and Commandant Instruction M16475.1D, you clearly define there would not be a significant impact on the human environment. All those concerns into account, it is important to establish a temporary safety zone.
    Thank you for the opportunity to provide comments on it.

I believe the proposed temporary safety zone duration should be extended to provide some cushion time for the air shows. This cushion time will be convenient should the air show be pre-poned or delayed for any reason. Also, it will ensure that any unauthorized persons or vessels do not enter the safety zone immediately before the scheduled air show. ",,,,,,,

However, later you developed that upon approval some vessels will be aloud to enter if approved by the Captain of the Port Sector Upper Mississippi River or a designated representative. One question that comes to mind is what are some potential scenarios that would allow a vassal acceptance into the safety zone? Of those that get approved to enter how can we ensure the up most safety for those vassals who are clearly a potential risk? With the waterways between MM 366.3 and 369.8 being closed for nearly six hours a day between the dates posted above is their a possibility to narrow the time frame down a vassal can get approval to enter the safety zone during this time? Possibly when you can ensure more safety can be provided?

The main focus is to make sure that the vessels traveling through these mile markers are going to be in no danger.

Although I am not part of a business entity that would be affected by the Regulatory Flexibility Act, I would like to state that this regulation is quite considerate of the environment around the firework display. I would, however, like to raise concern on whether debris that comes from this display will affect any marine life. If any harmful damage can occur as a result of this display, it is essential to develop a plan or safety precautions to protect marine life; this can include netting, platforms that will collect the debris or implementing barriers in the water. Some individuals may argue that constructing these barriers or safety precautions may create a situation in which the costs outweigh the benefits. Although this may be true, it is critical to note that if this region continues to display fireworks in this area year after year, the cost will soon be irrelevant in comparison to the benefit. After all, it is probable that the United States will not stop celebrating Independence Day in the future.",,,,,,,

By passing this proposal, civilians will be at less risk of injury to person or property and the Coast Guard will prevent itself from any liability. I believe this rule benefits both parties and should therefore be approved.",,,,,,,

However, one question or concern I have is regarding the timing that the Apra Outer Harbor becomes a designated safety zone. As the rule reads now the Apra Outer Harbor becomes ""a safety zone from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. on July 4, 2019."" At the same time, the fireworks show is set to begin at 6:00 p.m. and last until 9 p.m. 

If the goal of the rule is ""to ensure the safety of vessels and these navigable waters before, during, and after the scheduled 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. fireworks display,"" then the timing of the designated should be broader than the fireworks show itself.

As a practical consideration, this means that someone could lawfully be in the middle of the safety zone at 5:59 p.m. with the show set to start one minute later. Even if they were to be escorted out at 6 p.m., based on this rule, they could still be exposed to the potential dangers of being too close to a fireworks show.

Considering expanding the duration that Apra Outer Harbor is a safety zone, even from 5:30 p.m. to 9:30 p.m. would alleviate these concerns, not add too much of burden, and be consist with the safety concerns this rule is attempting to address. ",,,,,,,

If a firework explodes and hits a vessel that would not be very good. I think it is a good idea because it won't cause people to make stupid mistakes and hurt others. It is good because it will protect people from getting hurt. Overall I agree with this regulation.

I have 2 comments I'd like to share at this time. 

With regard to publications, I would like to note that the Subchapter T Inspection Checklist provided on Homeport (https://homeport.uscg.mil/Lists/Content/Attachments/2581/T-Boat%20PreInsp%20List.pdf) lists 46 CFR 166-199 as a Recommended"" document to be carried aboard. I'd like to recommend that NVIC 01-16 Change 2 addresses this recommendation. Specifically, I'd like to suggest that 46 CFR 166-199 is recommended to be carried aboard in electronic or paper version, and that this recommendation is mentioned in the updated NVIC. 

Second, I would like to suggest that discussion is provided in NVIC 01-16 regarding mariner credentialing. Specifically, I recommend that approved training courses/programs are permitted and encouraged to train students in the use of electronic publications, including the applicable CFRs. ",,,,,,,

Requiring paper charts as a primary source of navigation information is analogous to requiring paper and pencil to do arithmetic problems when it is actually computers and calculators that do this sort of work. Paper charts are not as updated as frequently as electronic charts can be, require more space to use and storage when the modern vessels use all electronics throughout the vessel, it is silly to require paper charts. 

As a licensed captain, I have not had to use paper charts in well over 10-15 years. ",,,,,,,

The United States Coast Guard policies and standards for inspection activities provide for a system of reporting that is essential to safe operation of vessels.  The information collection for certificates of compliance, boiler and pressure vessel repairs, cargo gear repairs, shipping papers and NFPA 10 certification harmonizes how the CG conducts an examination and allows for consistency in evaluating vessels both foreign and domestic.

The information collection request verifies data needed to verify safety of operations under 46 CFR Part 97 etal.  The forms contain action codes, instructions and notices that are easily delineated and understood by users.

The certificate of compliance substantiates that a vessel is fit for duty and along with the other criteria helps to detect deficiencies in the safety management system of the vessel that hinder compliance.

The boiler and pressure vessel repair reporting where the regulations have a preemptive effect over state and local regulation in the same field make it essential to verify the nature of repairs to important maritime operational equipment.  It is a simplied format that is easily discerned by inspectors or repair persons.

Reporting on cargo gear repairs is important to determine condition and suitability of shipboard cargo gear such as masts, stays, winches, booms, cranes, elevators, running gear and other equipment.  The form is a certification that various tests including those required at least once in a year have been conducted.  

Shipping papers are important to verify quantity, proper shipping name, hazard class or suitability and other data for lading on vessels.  These forms are harmonized worldwide, and the information well understood by any experienced commercial mariner.

NFPA 10 certificates ensure that that fire protection systems are under an inspection, repair and maintenance program so that this important equipment is operational if needed. 

Synonymous data elements on federal forms and reporting mechanisms have sometimes been used interchangeably.  Common data elements standardize the information collection to promote increased efficiency and interoperability of the reporting process.

The paperwork burden on responders is minimal and the information captured is essential to protect the public.  The Coast Guard request for extension should be approved.

The Marine Chart Division (MCD) of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is responsible for charting U.S. coastal waters. Pursuant to that responsibility, NOAA depicts the locations of permanent safety zones established by the U.S. Coast Guard. The purpose of my comment is to provide feedback regarding the notice of this proposal to establish a permanent Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) safety zone around the Big Foot Tension Leg Platform, located in Walker Ridge 29 on OCS in the Gulf of Mexico. Refer to Federal Register / Vol. 84, No. 243 / Wednesday, December 18, 2019 / Pages 69348 - 69349.

My credentials follow:

Nautical cartographer, member since May 2016 in the Nautical Data Branch (NDB) of the MCD at NOAA.

Experience in vetting boundaries and regulations associated with Federal Register Proposed and Final Rules as they relate to nautical charting under the direction of senior cartographic reviewers.

Assigned by my branch chief to examine the Federal Register Notice associated with this proposal to establish a permanent OCS safety zone.

Experienced in using GIS software, i.e., ArcMap 10.5.1, in plotting geographic coordinates on NOAA nautical charts.

My feedback follows:

(1) Supplementary Information ""III. Discussion of Proposed Rule"" currently states ""The Coast Guard proposes to establish an permanent OCS safety zone extending 500 meters (1,640.4 feet) from the coordinates: Latitude N 26-55 longitude W 90-31-14.952.

(2) Section ""147.861 Safety Zone; Big Foot Tension Leg Platform, Outer Continental Shelf on the Gulf of Mexico."" currently states ""(a) Description. The Big Foot Tension Leg Platform (TLP) is in the deepwater area of the Gulf of Mexico at Walker Ridge 29. The Big Foot TLP is located at latitude N 26-55.308 and longitude W 90-31-14.952, and the area within 500 meters of the Big Foot TLP, is a permanent safety zone.""

Discrepancies exist with the formatting of the coordinates specified in that the latitude of the former (1) is in degrees-minutes while the latitude of the latter (2) is in degrees-decimal minutes, and the longitude of both the former (1) and the latter (2) is in degrees-minutes-decimal seconds. I request to consider a revision of the formatting of the latitude coordinates specified in both (1) and (2) to degrees-minutes-decimal seconds. The horizontal datum (e.g. North American Datum 27 (NAD 27), North American Datum 83 (NAD 83), World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS 84)) of the coordinates is not specified. I request to consider an addition of the horizontal datum to the coordinates. The purpose of these considerations is to increase consistency and accuracy while to simultaneously eliminate any potential confusion.

Inc owns and operates a fleet of three Subchapter K vessels on the Mississippi River in Saint Paul, MN at Mile 840 UMR. We are a small family business that normally operates from April through October with a workforce of 60 seasonal employees and 10 full time employees. Our vessels range in size from 162 to 300 passengers, we carry 90,000 passengers annually on regularly scheduled sightseeing, dinner and lunch cruises as well as private charters.

We are highly concerned over the planned RedBull Flugtag event and the accompanying special local regulations proposed. Our company has suffered multiple high water events this spring and early summer leading to significant loss of revenue and cancellations. We simply can not afford to incur further cancellations and lost revenue due to this event. More importantly we are highly concerned in regards to the safety of spectators, vessels  and our licensed marine staff that may arise during the event due to extreme congestion on the waterway and a potential lack of law enforcement vessels. 
Thank you,

This resulted in approved transits through the area not being able to be accomplished due to safety concerns. The patrol vessels were not able to maintain a navigable channel through the spectator vessels and any hopes of transiting needed to be abandoned. And, I believe this took place even before the actual event began.

Many more patrol vessels than in the past will be needed to maintain order. Additionally, significant efforts will need to be made to keep the navigation channel clear prior to the event and to clear the channel immediately after the event.

It is not secret that commercial navigation and all the industries that depend on it have been very severely impacted by high water this year. Being in a northern climate, there will not be nearly enough days to catch-up before winter again sets in. However, we accept that we are but one of a vast number of legitimate beneficiaries of the river. And, we understand that entertainment is an appropriate activity on the river. Though a seven-hour closure seems a bit much, it is the control of the situation before, during, and after the scheduled event that is paramount.

Safety is our greatest concern. Without adequate controls, the effect of the spectator vessels can get out of hand. We are trusting that the USCG; law enforcement; and the event sponsor will ensure that enough patrol vessels are in place to appropriately manage the situation. Additionally, we are willing to work with the aforementioned entities to do what we reasonably can to help create a successful event.

navigation and mooring of LNG carriers through the San Juan Harbor San Juan PR.

The timing of these meetings, both of which are to be conducted on 7/26/19, should be reconsidered in light of the extreme unrest and mass protests, and in some cases, violence, occurring in San Juan at the current time as the people of Puerto Rico are calling for the resignation of their governor. Based on current events, these meetings should be rescheduled, or additional meetings should be scheduled for a later date when the people can be more focused on the LNG carrier safety issues and not on the performance of their governor. Some people who would normally attend may not turn out, not wanting to encounter the protesting groups in their travel to the meeting location, the Sheraton Puerto Rico Hotel and Casino, 200 Convention Boulevard, San Juan. 

Although the opportunity to input on regulations.gov until August 4th is provided on this electronic forum, no information in terms of supporting documents are attached to this meeting notice. The documents detailing the proposed adjustment to the current safety zone established under 33 CFR165.754, Safety Zone: San Juan Harbor,San Juan, PRare not provided online. Providing the documents electronically would be allow people concerned about the unrest and violence to stay safely in their homes, read the documents, and still provide input. The information is currently planned to be given out at the meeting, which the people may not be able to attend due to the unrest, therefore eliminating the possibility of any input. Providing the information electronically also allows the elderly, and people with busy schedules, to input.

Right now, cruise ships are not docking in San Juan as a result of the unrest, which is being reported on quite extensively in the media. Thousands of people are turning out into the streets and highways. The protests have been ongoing and daily and could be expected to continue through the 26th, if the governor doesn't resign. Also the issue of their governance is acting as a red herring in distracting the people's attention from the important issues concerning LNG. 

The issue of LNG in the San Juan Harbor does not only affect the people of San Juan. Other harbor users, including the tourists who travel on the cruise ships which visit Puerto Rico, are affected by LNG carriers and their navigation and mooring in San Juan Harbor. These tourists are not likely to be in San Juan at the current time due to the fact that the cruise ships are not docking there due to the unrest. Any of these tourists who might be interested in attending these meetings will not be able to attend, and also cannot get the information to comment online, since the information is not posted here. A vehicle to allow these people, and other people who are currently on the mainland of the USA, either natives of San Juan who travel back and forth, or US mainland based residents who may occasionally cruise to or vacation in San Juan and other ports of call, also cannot get the information, since they cannot be expected to all be in San Juan on July 26th. 

Therefore, I respectfully request that the meeting scheduled for 7/26/19 be postponed and held at a later date, or conducted as scheduled, with additional sessions held later at a less volatile time. Also, I request that the information concerning the safety zone changes, and the other documents mentioned in the Federal Register 34323 Vol. 84, No. 138 published on Thursday, July 18, 2019, as described, be posted in this docket. This includes: The Letter of Intent and Waterway Suitability Assessment from New Fortress Energy to construct and operate the required infrastructure for offloading and transferring liquefied natural gas at the Army Terminal Turning Basin in San Juan, Puerto Rico received on Dec. 12, 2017 by the U.S. Coast Guard, the Coast Guard's recommendations, and the September 26, 2018 Coast Guard Sector San Juan determination of suitability for the proposed operation in the Port of San Juan that was made. 

Thank you for your consideration of my comments. I have cruised in the past, and would like to see the safety of cruise ships and other waterborne vessels in the harbor assured for all travelers, and for those people on land near the harbor or docks, which are very busy tourist areas. ",,,,,,,

CORALations is an award-winning coral conservation organization, founded and based in Puerto Rico.  

Summary
We are writing to request that additional hearings be announced and deadline extended for public comment, consistent with the advanced notice and publication requirements of the Administrative Procedures Act for reasons described below.   We ask Coast Guard to circulate official notice to the media, with focussed attention to effectively inform affected stakeholders. We ask that all related documents be posted online for public access and analysis as soon as possible.   

For the Record: 

The notice makes reference to The operation of LNG gas carriers and add the new facility within the San Juan Harbor, San Juan, PR.  It is not clear to us what add the new facility means. 

This notice was posted only 8 days prior to announced public hearings, and to our knowledge, only in the Federal Registry. While it may be possible for the Coast Guard to argue expedition on homeland security and navigational safety issues, this would not apply to addition a new LNG facility. 

We argue that meaningful public participation cannot be obtained anywhere with only 8 days prior notice. Nowhere would that be more true than Puerto Rico today.  The island is at an historic crossroad as FBI continues arrests of local government officials, and the governor was unseated by relentless, yet non-violent street demonstrations.  Local agencies involved in these critical determinations are currently in organizational chaos. A significant extension is only reasonable. 

We recognize minimal due diligence on the part of the Coast Guard to meet social justice obligations of public transparency and meaningful participation would include dissemination of this notice to the media, with focussed outreach to all impacted interests. This would include, but not be limited to:  local communities and industries found on the harbor, environmental organizations, interests that protect local historic and cultural patrimony of the old city, local tourism, the cruise ship industry, Isla Grande Airport, and commercial cargo shipping interests from the States as well as the Lesser Antilles. 

This very online form style prototype edition of the daily Federal Register on Federal Register.gov,1 displays prominently: 
This document has a comment period that ends in 70 days. (10/04/2019)   The description verbiage however, indicates deadline is on or before August 4th, 2019.  This can confuse the general public, and could result in meaningful comments not being recognized for the record. 

If the amendments add a new facility then likely a determination of consistency under the Federal Coastal Zone Management Act may be required. 

A new facility or mooring or transit would require Section 7 compliance to the Endangered Species Act, as the waters of the bay are listed critical habitat for the acroporid corals, that at least pre-Maria were found near the harbors entrance. 

This Harbor is surrounded by historic structures listed and/or eligible for listing in the National Registration of Historic Places. It is possible that official notice must be given to the National (NHPO) and local State Historic Preservation Offices (SHPO).

Information concerning the proposed safety zone changes, and the other documents referenced in the Federal Register 34323 Vol. 84, No. 138 were not posted, making it impossible for the public to provide meaningful analysis and comment.  We therefor ask that this also be rectified by posting for review any and all relevant documents in the federal record as well as those documents referenced specifically in notice:  

1) The proposed safety zone adjustment these hearings are being called for regarding the operation of LNG gas carriers and add the new facility within the San Juan Harbor, San Juan, PR. 

2) The Letter of Intent and Waterway Suitability Assessment from New Fortress Energy to construct and operate the required infrastructure for offloading and transferring liquefied natural gas at the Army Terminal Turning Basin in San Juan, Puerto Rico received on Dec. 12, 2017 by the U.S. Coast Guard.

3) The official response and recommendations from the Coast Guard to the Dec 12th letter from NFE. 

4) The Coast Guard Sector San Juan determination of suitability for the proposed operation in the Port of San Juan, September 26, 2018.

C.	Re: The proposed adjustment to the current safety zone established under 33 CFR 165.754, Safety Zone: San Juan Harbor, San Juan, PR.

1.	What information in the LOI, WSA, and other submittals to the USCG form the basis for the proposed adjustment?  Is all or any portion of that information available to the public?  Is the information required to be made available prior to an adjustment, for the adjustment to be valid and not subject to future challenge?  

2.	What are the specifics of the proposed adjustment?

3.	What type of increase in the size, type or frequency of vessels being used by NFE or others, would require either a new WSA determination, or an additional adjustment? 

D.	Re: The Coast Guard Sector San Juan and New Fortress Energy hosting public meetings on July 26, 2019 for the general public to provide comments regarding the proposed adjustment to the current safety zone established under 33 CFR 165.754, Safety Zone: San Juan Harbor, San Juan, PR.

1.	Is the public hearing required by law or regulation, for LNG to be delivered to SJH for:
(i) NFE's truck facility: and/or,
(ii) deliveries of LNG for San Juan 5&6?

2.	What information is required by law or regulation to be made available to the public in advance of the hearing on the proposed adjustment?

3.	Is it customary that, like here, the proposed adjustment has not been made available to the public in advance of a hearing to make comment on the proposed adjustment?

4.	Is it customary that, like here, the bases (studies, reports, analysis, and other submittals) for the proposed adjustment are not made available to the public in advance of a hearing to make comment on the proposed adjustment?

5.	If the public hearing is not required by law or regulation, what is the point of having the hearing without making public the content of the proposed adjustment, and the rationale and need for or the proposed adjustment?

E.	Re: PREPA proposed a land-based LNG terminal in San Juan to replace the New 
Fortress Energy ship-based LNG terminal in the latest Integrated Resource Plan submitted to the Puerto Rico Energy Bureau.  The land-based LNG terminal would provide natural gas to PREPA San Juan 5 & 6 units as well as to the PREPA Palo Seco complex via a to be constructed land-based pipeline.

1.  Did the Dec 2017 LOI submittal or the Sept 2018 WSA approval contemplate the ships delivering LNG to a land-based terminal, or the volumes increasing to serve Palo Seco?

2.  Will the proposed adjustment allow additional or larger LNG ships than that described by NFE to deliver larger LNG volumes to the proposed land-based LNG terminal?

3.  Will a separate letter of intent and waterway suitability assessment be required for ships to deliver cargoes into 
SJH for a land-based LNG terminal?

4.  Is the answer to 3 above different if only San Juan 5 & 6 use LNG from ships versus if volumes of approximately the same amount, are later desired or required for Palo Seco?

F.  The evaluations necessary to assess the safety and security concerns for a proposed LNG project require a diverse and varied expertise that is not only privately held by consultants and industry professionals but also contained within numerous governmental entities at the federal, Puerto Rico and local levels  as well as that contained within the expertise and experience of NGOs.  In that regard, which such parties were invited and, then participated, in the WSA for San Juan Harbor relative to the NFE project?

A.	Re: U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) receipt on December 12, 2017 of Letter of Intent (LOI) and Waterway Suitability Assessment (WSA) from New Fortress Energy (NFE) to construct and operate the required infrastructure for offloading and transferring of liquefied natural gas at the Army Terminal Turning Basin in San Juan Harbor (SJH) in San Juan, Puerto Rico.

1.	What assumptions as to number of cargoes, size of ships, cargo capacity of ships, and frequency, were used when USCG approved the WSA?   Where is this information made available to the public for review?

2.	Did the submitted LOI and WSA only consider shipping and infrastructure for: 
(i)	NFE's small, low-volume truck loading facility to provide LNG to on-island industrial users; and/or,
(ii)	large quantities of LNG to be vaporized and natural gas provided to Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA) San Juan 5 & 6 power generation units? [Note that after the Dec 2017 submittal by NFE, on July 30, 2018 PREPA issued the RFP 81412 for the supply of LNG and delivery of natural gas to San Juan 5 & 6 (PREPA RFP).  Therefore, it is not apparent that there was enough time to identify, analyze and incorporate PREPA RFP requirements not known in Dec 2017 in the Sept 2018 USCG WSA approval.  In addition, another reason PREPA RFP requirements may not have been considered in the Sept 2018 USCG WSA approval is that the PREPA selection of NFE for the supply of LNG and delivery of natural gas to San Juan 5 & 6 was made in November 2018, after the Sept 2018 USCG WSA approval.] 

3.	To the extent that the December 12, 2017 submitted LOI and WSA did not include construction and operation of infrastructure for LNG to be vaporized and natural gas provided to PREPA San Juan 5 & 6 power generation units, is it now included and if so when was it added?  When were the PREPA RFP requirements added to the WSA relative to the USCG WSA approval?

4.	Is all or any portion of the information in the LOI, WSA, and other submittals to the USCG that form the basis for the determination on September 26, 2018 that the Port of San Juan is suitable for the proposed operation, required to be made available to the public in advance of the WSA determination or this hearing?  Or customarily is it made available, even if not required by regulation?  The WSA process  when involving LNG terminal and shipping operations  is conducted in conjunction with the review process of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), which allows substantial review opportunities by the public and significant information being provided.  In the absence of FERC oversight relative to the New Fortress Energy project  there appears to be no sharing of project related information nor information regarding safety and security considerations and assessments that should be precedent to the requesting of comments.

5.	Besides this hearing and the 2018 WSA approval, does the USCG plan on having additional approvals or hearings relative to this project or other projects that might propose to transport, store and use LNG in San Juan Harbor, for issues such as hazard studies or exclusion zones?  Will the hazard studies and information forming the basis of security and safety zones be released to the public, in whole or in part, prior to a final determination of any changes to 33 CFR 165.754.  Equally important  why is this information apparently not available now prior to the Comment Deadline?

6.	How are allowable ship sizes, ship LNG cargo capacities, delivery frequencies, and mooring durations determined with respect to safety and hazard analyses?

7.	Was there an evaluation of how frequency of LNG deliveries would impact other shipping traffic in SJH and thus require adjustments to the activities of 3rd parties?  Without such information  a traffic impact assessment in a manner of speaking  how would one have any basis to provide a meaningful comment to the hearing proposed for 33 CFR 165.754?

B.	For the purposes of considering a WSA or an adjustment to the existing harbor regulations, does it matter whether the LNG is delivered in:
(i) containers that are offloaded onto shore, versus 
(ii) delivered in on-board tanks and pumped from the vessel into onshore storage facilities, versus 
(iii) regasified on a vessel moored in the harbor, with the gas piped onto shore to be used in power plants?

There are many questions with respect to the proposed LNG zone that remain unanswered. The lack of access to information about the proposed LNG zone impedes meaningful public participation in the administrative proceeding and the due process that the USCG must afford the citizenry, particularly residents who live within the potential impact zone of the proposed LNG operation.  The public requires access to the file, including the Letter of Intent, Water Suitability Assessment and Report, and other documents. 

Is there a separate proposal for a safety zone for the LNG carriers/ships while they are moored?
What is the proposed size of the LNG carriers/ships entering the bay?
Will there be a limitation on the size of the LNG carriers/vessels that will be entering the bay?
What is the proposed number and frequency per year of LNG carriers/ships in San Juan Bay?
Will there be a limit on the number of LNG carriers/ships in the Bay?
How much time will the LNG carriers/ships take to unload the LNG? Will unloading time vary for truck deliveries and supplies for the PREPA San Juan units?
How long will the LNG carriers/ships be permitted to be moored in the docks/wharfs?
Is the safety zone contemplated for LNG shipments to feed/supply trucking operations, the PREPA San Juan 5 & 6 units, both, other projects, or any shipment of LNG into San Juan Bay?
What is the estimated total yearly maximum volume of LNG to be brought in through San Juan Bay for the trucking project?
What is the estimated total yearly maximum volume of LNG to be brought in through San Juan Bay for the PREPA units?
What is the estimated total yearly maximum volume of LNG to be brought in through San Juan Bay for any other uses?
Will the LNG be transported in ISO containers or in bulk tanks or any other method?
Will there ever be more than one LNG carrier in San Juan Bay?
Will there be ship to ship transfers of LNG in San Juan Bay?
What precautions would be required for the LNG carriers/ships in the Bay?
Will additional safety and/or emergency plans, equipment or facilities be required for LNG shipments into San Juan Bay?
How and where will the LNG for the San Juan 5 & 6 units be revaporized?
What is the population-how many people live and/or work within a thirty-mile radius of the wharfs where the LNG Floating Storage Unit (FSU) would be moored?
What notice, if any was provided to the communities within the potential impact zone of the LNG project?
What is the cost of the different aspects of the NFE LNG shipping project, wharf work, truck loading, supply infrastructure for PREPA supply and total cost?
What contracts have been entered into for the NFE LNG shipping project and the former government administration including contracts relating to the port and for supply of LNG to the PREPA plants?
What permits are required for each aspect of the LNG shipping project and the status of each?
Why does New Fortress Energy allege that Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) authorization is not required for the importation of LNG into San Juan Bay? Are there any documents to substantiate this NFEs position?
Has the United States Army Corp of Engineers (USACE) issued any permits for any aspects of the LNG shipping project? If so, are they available to the public?
Are there any environmental assessments or impact statements for the NFE LNG shipping projects? If so, are they available to the public?
Has the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued any permits for any aspect of the LNG shipping projects? If so, are they available to the public?
Has there been consultation on the NFE LNG projects with the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, National Marine Fisheries Service (USFWS, NOAA/NMFS)? If so, is the documentation available to the public?
Has there been consultation with the Puerto Rico agencies on the NFE LNG projects? If so, please provide the documentation.
What is the casualty history in San Juan Bay?
What is the status of the San Juan Harbor Improvement project?
What are the limitations of the Army Terminal?
Would more frequent LNG shipments be required because of the limitations of the Army Terminal?
What has the modeling for upset conditions for the LNG shipping demonstrated?
What do the simulation studies indicate about the proposed LNG shipments?
What other kinds of zones-exclusion, security, etc. are contemplated for the LNG shipment projects?

The establishment of an LNG safety zone in San Juan Harbor has far-reaching implications for the Puerto Rico electric system,  and would create incentives to perpetuate central station, fossil fuel generation that negatively impacts public health and the environment, drains the Puerto Rican economy and lacks resiliency.  El Puente/ELAC respectfully requests that the Coast Guard allow access to the information requested, deny the proposed rule amendment and the establishment of an LNG zone in San Juan Harbor.",,,,,,"https://downloads.regulations.gov/USCG-2019-0460-0006/attachment_1.pdf",

The EPA when establishing protocols for the types of  BWMS that are approved, needs to address the high risk of significant human health problems created ballast water.       
     Spreading algae, that an algal virus is known to thrive in, and is known to have jumped species becoming a human pathogen should be considered by an agency who mission is to protect the environment, completely unacceptable.                          Mosquitos carry many human pathogens and their larva thrives in algae. Theses work done by Elizabeth Kathleen McCraven published by the university of New Orleans as far back as 2009 states mosquito larva is often found in ballast water. The need to prevent bacteria, virus, and other invasive species from being spread is essential if our waters are to be protected for future generations. Some ballast water problems are multiple issue and may be addressed better at land based facilities. With shipping traffic expected to grow exponential in harmony with increase trade and population,  failure to act with strong standards for BWMS  will continue to destroy our water resources. We can not afford to take a wait and see position about whether a viruss is capable of causing human health problems. When considering the testing protocols fo BWMS it should be imperative that BWMS need to render all VIRUS and bacteria non viable with a goal for the future of a zero particle count. An invasive pathogenic virus introduced now by ballast water is even capable of laying dormant in sediment With the possibility of finding a host years later. Once an invasive is introduced it is usually to late to fix the problem.",,,,,,,

Dear Sirs,
  When considering the protocols, and testing procedures that BWMS must meet, to protect human, wildlife and agricultural health against the risk posed by the vast universe of unknown bacteria, virus, fungus, etc., in ballast water, waiting to act for onboard BWMS development to meet all goals, is not an acceptable reason to avoid action now. Evaluating and improvement of BWMS should be a continual work in progress with changes made as technology advances not according to a timetable review.
   Infrastructure projects of Land based facilities to test and develop new BWMS while cleaning ballast water for commercial use need to be built to facilitate continuous improvement. Ships should be required to install the best BWMS available now, in conjunction with development of land based BWMS facilities.    
   The expense for ships using land based BWMS facilities as an alternative to onboard BWMS, should be lower. Cost to maintain and operate BWMS equipment or the need to replace a system that in the future may prove inadequate, would be eliminated. Ships using land based BWMS could be free from installation cost, maintenance, inspection, and save space when multiple BWMS applications are needed for various issues. Ships both foreign and domestic using onboard BWMS should be periodically required to submit to inspection, to insure BWMS are being maintained in working order. Land based system would eliminate financial incentive for ships autonomous business interests, tempted to cut corners to save money.  Land based BWMS facilities would allow easier study and sampling by the EPA, Coast Guard, educational institutions, scientist and BWMS manufactures to continually improve protocols, standards and testing for onboard BWMS, as well as ships using the facilities. Ships with structural designs that will not support BWMS could be kept in service with land based BWMS facilities.
   Virus in the worlds waters not already moved, are believed to be regional in origin. With land based BWMS the study of new virus, bacteria, fungus, and invasive species could provide a wealth of information to protect human and wildlife health world wide. New Invasive and harmful pathogens could be detected earlier at land base facilities monitoring ballast water discharges. By using land based BWMS facilities there would not be interference or involvement with the internal operation of both domestic and foreign ships.  
    Algae, chemical spills, etc., possibly could be cleaned from our waters with the use of land based BWMS facilities. With oil spills, chemicals spills, discarded nuclear waste dumping, toxic waste dumping along with the known nuclear accident spilling into oceans, (which are infecting the worlds waters) all BWMS should be capable of detecting these problems, so they can be addressed. Homeland security should be involved with many of dangers ballast water poses when the protocols, standards and testing of BWMS are considered for both foreign and domestic flag ships that are discharging millions of gallons of ballast water into American waters.
     It has been reported, the issue of BWMS and the Great Lakes states, along with other states that have specific issues affecting sensitive waters, will be addressed by the EPA in the fall of 2020. The protections and use of BWMS that are needed to address the dangers of ballast water should not be subject to what is believed will be allowed in the final implementation of the legislation signed in Dec 2018. Compromised standards that do not completely protect our waters are unacceptable. BWMS protocols, regulations should be based solely on what is needed to insure protection of our waters.
    Each of the Great Lakes having unique eco systems and their own issues of pollution and invasive species, should be required to use BWMS on all ships traversing the Great Lakes, whether land based or onboard. The need to stop the spread of invasive species and pathogenic problems such as algae and mosquitoes from being spread through out the Great Lakes is essential to preserving these great natural resources for the future.  
    Most viral and bacterial pathogens in putrid water become more problematic when it is warm. Today we have beach closings as a results of red tides mixing with green algae, flesh eating bacteria, brain eating bacteria, mosquitoes carrying deadly disease etc.,  all in warming waters. Unknown virus and bacteria are being released by melting arctic ice and from waters all over the world, creating an exponentially greater risk in ballast water discharges. Compromised BWMS  standards will not protect  against the exponential growth of ship traffic. 
     BWMS facilities probably will never be the silver bullet to replace all on board BWMS, but in many instances it may be the only adequate solution, providing  the bonus of facilitating continuous research for the development of new BWMS with better testing methods to insure future BWMS will work.

My name is Wenjun Sun and I am an Associate Professor at Tsinghua University in Beijing, China.  Professor Wenjun Liu and I, on behalf of Tsinghua Disinfection Research Center, had done extensive research and testing of ballast water treatment (BWT) systems in China since 2008.  Our center is one of the centers of excellence in China for studying disinfection science and technologies, including chlorine, ozone, UV, etc. for municipal water and ballast water treatment.   We have conducted full-scale testing of BWT systems.

We have gained significant experimental data over more than 10 years which prove that the most probable number (MPN) method is a very appropriate method for measuring viable organisms in ballast water after treatment with ballast water management systems (BWMS), particularly for UV based systems.   
I do not agree with the Draft Policy Letter statement that there are no ""type-approval testing protocols for BWMS that render nonviable organisms in ballast water that are based on the best available science.""  The MPN methodology is used regularly in IMO type-approval testing of BWMS.  That methodology is correct when nonviable means ""permanently incapable of reproduction"", because it provides more than enough time (weeks) for organisms to dark-repair and photo-repair (hours) (Hull et al. 2017).  Repair happens right away (Sancar and Sancar 1998, Sinha and Hader 2002), and both dark-repair and photo-repair happens toghether when the lights are on.  

Water treatment of ballast water is a new application compared to water treatment of drinking water and wastewater which has many decades of experience.  We can look at that experience and knowledge to help learn for ballast water treatment.  In China, as in the United States and all other countries that have water treatment regulations, culture methods like MPN are used to make sure the water is safe for people to drink and safe to go to the environment.  No method is described as used for organisms that are ""permanently incapable of reproduction"", so we need to think if they would be, and because the culture methods give time to repair, they do show this.  The same applies to ballast water organisms, culture methods like MPN give time for repair to happen and can be used to test systems that ""render organisms nonviable permanently incapable of reproduction"".  It is probably why culture methods are used for bacteria in ballast water (ETV 2010) even though those methods do not have ""permanent inactivation"" in their titles.  

The USCG should adopt IMO MPN methodology because it is available right now, it matches for  organisms that are permanently incapable of reproduction, and it is supported by the best available science.  

With respect,

It is noted that in the context of ballast water mediated invasions of organisms the ability to reproduce is more relevant than the vitality of the transferred organisms. 
Determining the ability to reproduce is commonly defined as ""Viability testing""

CUC IL deems that 'Viability testing' is an appropriate way to evaluate ballast water treatment systems because it determines the ability of organisms to reproduce after being discharged into a new environment.

Viability testing is a widely accepted method to analyze the <10 m fraction using the Most-Probable-Number (MPN) technique, such as the EPA-accepted Colilert and Enterolert methods from IDEXX for E. coli and enterococci.

Internationally, MPN-based assays for the 10-50m fraction are widely accepted in the ballast water test community. 
As demonstrated by DNV GL and associated sublabs, there is ample scientific support for the reliability of aforementioned  MPN-based assays.

In conclusion, CUC IL endorses and supports the inclusion of an MPN-based assay for the 10-50 m fraction in the context of USCG Type Approval testing of ballast water management systems.

In this comment submitted via attachment, plus supporting documents, we reiterate the value and validity of the MPN method for determining performance of ballast water management systems (BWMS) that permanently render organisms incapable of reproduction and argue for its adoption by the USCG.  Eleven internationally known and well respected scientists and engineers have signed on to this opinion.

While the USCG claim to have no knowledge of an MPN method based on best available science, we cite 12 peer-reviewed scientific publications related to use of an MPN method for BWMS that have been published since 2015.  Many of these evaluate UV-based disinfection processes.  We also note that the MPN method is an accepted method for International Maritime Organization (IMO) type-approval testing.  We review evidence as to why culture-based methods implicitly include any repair or reactivation in their assessment, and determine permanent inactivation of relevant organisms for BWM for UV-based or oxidant based disinfectants. We also note that every major public health regulation world-wide accepts the use of culture-based methods, such as the MPN method for assessing protection of public health.

We conclude that 
	UV disinfection is a safe and effective means for permanently inactivating prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms with decades of research backing this fact.
	Culture methods such as MPN are accepted under US federal regulation for use in drinking water and wastewater compliance testing and public health monitoring, and other than some of the organisms in ballast water in the USA, are the standard for regulated methods around the world.
	The algae MPN-based method utilizes an extended period of light exposure that would incorporate any possibility of photo-repair and light-independent repair, and is conservative for determining viability of UV disinfected organisms.
	UV is effective and works at very low doses for organisms of concern in BWMS, thus it is an economical option for treatment and should be an available technology for the maritime industry.

We are a US based, EPA registered FIFRA pesticide used for water treatment, biofilm removal and as a medical grade disinfectant, sanitizer, algaecide, fungicide and biocide. 

After reviewing the Ballast Water treatment programs, we propose the use of a newer product option, which utilizes nanotechnology to eradicate mollusks, pathogens, barnacles and other fouling agents within the ballast tanks. 

Our technology is implemented with ease, and simplicity whereas past and current product options require significant infrastructure, chemical generation equipment, multiple product programs, and gallons of liquid chemicals to be stored on ships where space and weight are commodities. The solution provided by our Company provides logistic advantages, reduced storage mass, and ease of use which is not currently utilized while enhancing ship and crew safety.

The currently proposed range of technologies using chlorine products, peracetic acid or hydrogen peroxide do not treat biofilm passively.  Chlorine and peracetic acids are not capable of preventing bio-adaptation which is critical in emergent and invasive species. Chlorine, peracetic acid and hydrogen peroxide are not stable in vacillating pH ranges. Chlorine is not stable beyond pH 7.8-8.0. These and other proposed chemical options can create toxic by-products making them a poor choice for aquatic ecosystems and environments.  

Chlorine dioxides used in ballast tank treatments are archaic technologies which use generated chlorine dioxide, sulfuric acid and other toxic chemicals to produce a chlorine dioxide product. Though they do remove biofilm, these outdated techniques require large volumes of liquid chemical to be stored and do not provide logistic advantages. 
 
Utilizing our technology removes the above barriers, and provides a stable chemical, and safer environment for the ship, crew and aquatic life. Our technology is a tablet or powder form which creates only Na (sodium) as a byproduct making it a safer solution for aquatic life. Currently EPA registered for water treatment and as a Medical Grade disinfectant, we can reduce the bioburden and pathogen load with up to 8-log reductions in less than 5 minutes while lowering the mass of chemicals storage on a ship and provide safer and simpler solutions for dry dock ballast treatments as well. 

The chemistry has a quick activation time to provide efficient results in seconds where sudden ejection of ballast tank contents could have resulted in catastrophic outcomes for the environment and aquatic life using other technologies. 
It is our recommendation our chemistry be utilized in dry dock ballast treatments and cleaning protocols to provide a superior method of pathogen eradication and safe residual biofilm reduction. 

We are proud to present better solutions to protect waters from invasive and emergent species and pathogens today and for a safer future. Our technology provides better and safer solutions even when ships are required to reduce ballast contents quickly. 

We look forward to hearing from you. We are fully engaged in utilizing US Coast Guard and EPA compliant solutions which are smarter, safer and provide superior logistic advantages to the current market solutions.  

Please contact us for additional technical data.

This comment is submitted within the comment period which ends September 3, 2019.
This event is being conducted by an entity that has a privately owned racing facility built to its specifications and paid for by public tax dollars.

*  The location is not good as it is a choke point along the ICW.  There are NO alternate routes.  There are numerous other safe locations this event could be held, specifically the publicly funded, yet private facility built for the Sarasota Scullers at the World Class Benderson Park, Sarasota Bay, Blackburn Bay, Lemon Bay and numerous other locations.

*  The length of time of the shutdown is excessive (twelve hours).

* The Day of the week is least conducive to a complete waterway shutdown.  This can be held during the week or at non-peak hours.

*The location of the proposed command center (launch) for this race is a major Boat Ramp paid for by boating taxpayers.  While this boat ramp is physically located within the City of Venice, it is owned and managed by Sarasota County.  Residents from all over Sarasota County utilize this facility and it is one of the largest and busiest.  Shutting down this ramp on a Saturday (arguably the busiest boating day of the week) will be a hindrance to the overall good of the boating community. In reality, however, the ramp is shut down to public access the day PRIOR for set up, translating into a TWO DAY Closure.

The event last year was such a planning failure that it received very minimal participation and even fewer spectators.  It was such a bust that the event was shut down early, but boaters were still negatively impacted and were not notified of the early stoppage. It was NOT shut down early as a consolation to boaters; they simply had no participation in the race.",,,,,,,

Within those slips is A rental boat company with a fleet of six boats and also waves boat and social club with their fleet consisting of nine boats. We get lots of boat traffic here on the weekends especially with our fuel dock being conveniently placed on the ICW. Not to mention we have a restaurant on the property that gets a fair amount of customers from the water. As if the red tide wasnt enough to hurt our business last year then we also had one whole day where boaters couldnt come in or out at the marina because of this regatta. 
Im sure there is a time and place for this to take place, but just on our property alone we have 4 different Businesses, Ill greatly affected by this event. We are one of three marinas in the local area affected by this

There are No alternate routes and this will undoubtedly force inexperienced boaters into the Gulf. This is ridiculous and a safety factor that was overlooked.  Who will take ownership of any incidents?Boat owners pay registration fees that fund the boat ramp. These rowboats pay no vessel registrations. How can the decision makers give exclusive access to an outside entity that does not fund the ramp and take it away from those that do, regardless if its 12 hours or 12 minutes? The coast guard (probably in Miami) is charged with deciding whether to allow this event but the concern is they dont have a feel for the Local intimacies of our boaters, the uniqueness of the proposed Venue and its impact on the locals.

The Battle of the Bridges event on September 28th, 2019, would stop boater related activities on the ICW from Stump Pass to the Venice outlet. This is very inconvenient to local businesses, marinas and recreational boaters. The following comments are germane:

1. Last years even had only a couple of entrants, and community interest was minimal...yet access was still denied.
2. When the rowing club has access to Benderson Park, which was built (at great cost) for just this purpose, why is the event not held there?
3. The negative effect on local businesses (i.e. boat fueling, boat rentals, boat fishing charters, etc.), local marina operations and recreational boaters far exceeds minimal commercial revenues from such a small venue.
4. The event organizers have displayed ""bullying"" behavior toward the local community at large, and seem to avoid local (boating) community involvement, as evidenced last year and again this year.

Please cancel this event and inform the organizers of the displeasure they have evoked.

The area was set up for local  tax paying boaters not  such events.",,,,,,,

In a parallel sense, suppose I request the 12 hour closure of I-75 because my auto club wants to conduct a drag racing competition.
Seriously, the rowers have their stadium in which they can participate.  The idea that they want to curtail my rights and the rights of other tax payers is obnoxious to me. ",,,,,,,

The number one priority for US Rowing is safety. Because three bridges are part of this regatta course, it is very important that vessel traffic is controlled during the regatta. Danger of collision can be a serious matter because the boats rowers are using offer little protection.

Last years regatta ran well because only approved regatta support power boats were on the course. The regatta finished early and the waterway was reopened early.

I have been involved with other regattas on the intercostal waterway as a rower and an official where the regatta did not restrict vessel traffic. In every case, safety issues caused races to be stopped. Most boaters are very respectful of others using the waterway but unfortunately you never know when one boat will put others at unnecessary risk.

With the current concern over toxic flesh eating algae in the gulf which caused death to individuals with open wounds, the risk of swamping a rower are higher than ever.

While the economic concerns of businesses are valid, it is hoped that safety will remain the top priority.

Venice has a proud tradition of supporting sports and become the best in the state in multiple years. Rowing is a rapidly growing sport in Florida but this the only rowing regatta in Venice the entire year.

In closing, I would like thank the USCG for the important support it is giving to boater safety.",,,,,,,

Hi Danielle,
December 3, 6, or 10 would work for an afternoon meeting.  It can be just us and meet at a neutral place or anyone else that you wish to meet with and we can use City Hall. Shirley Gibson schedules our special events, Roger Clark is in planning and is very familiar with what can and cant be done as is City Engineer Kathleen Weeden.
Let me know and where, when and with whom and Ill set it up.

Good afternoon Major Holic.
 
I was wondering if in the next few weeks you might have 30 minutes for me to talk about the Battle of the Bridges rowing regatta.
 
It is a rowing event we at Sarasota Scullers hosted last year in Venice. We are looking at next years event and before we more forward we wanted to get input from you and the City. I would like to keep the meeting small if possible. 
 
A late afternoon appointment would be best for me so I can come after school.
 
Look forward to seeing you soon,
Danielle

   Why is there no wiggle room for compromise on any of this?  Lets be realistic, a twelve-hour COMPLETE SHUTDOWN of the Main and only Navigable thoroughfare?  Why cant there be some concessions on the part of the race organizers?  Why cant vessels be escorted and allowed to slowly and safely pass through at designated times?  
 
   Im not opposed to this group, just this plan.   The below link to an ABC 7 Sarasota You Tube video from last years event, specifically the interview with ""Julie towards the end, highlights the unfortunate, but real disconnect between this small rowboat group and the larger boating community.
 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeUJYkVFJlI
 
   Venice Train Station boat ramp is closed for the day of the event and a significant part of the day prior for set-up.  Last year the floating docks were installed around 11:00 am the day before; the group declaring Docks in on their Facebook page. This ramp is used in the evening hours for sunset cruises, dinner at waterfront restaurants (Old Salty Dog, Marker 4, Pops, Crows Nest, etc.), evening fishing, etc.  They are losing money by this event!  To classify this shutdown as just a few hours as previous commenters have mentioned is not factual.  As Denise Fisher stated in her comment (Public Submission ID: USCG-2019-0508-0027) I feel the water- way in Venice should be used by all.  And by all, I would hope when she truly means All, especially the ones who pay extra taxes to access and maintain said waterway.  If thats what she means, I agree.
 
   Many boaters have smaller vessels that are not safe to enter the Gulf of Mexico in anything less than stellar conditions. Doesnt the USCG advocate for safe boating?    Why has this been overlooked?
 
    Marine Max marina at the south bridge on the ICW accommodates hundreds of vessels and Fishermans Wharf to the north has in excess of sixty.  Additionally, Country Club Estates on the Island and Harbor Lights Cooperative, LLC. would add an additional forty vessels.  That is a LOT of boats in a very small  area, not including boats that are launched at the Train Depot.
 
  It has recently been stated by the race organizer that all the permits have ALREADY been approved by the City and USCG.  That is FACTUALLY NOT TRUE.  These marinas believe they have no choice but to acquiesce and go along and accept whatever Concessions the race organizer feels appropriate.  Fishermans Wharf was actually asked to produce sales receipts to prove their losses.  Please have a rep from any government agency supporting this race call the businesses and ask.  It will be an eye opener!  Marine Max 941 485-3388, Fishermans Wharf 941 893-7870.  Businesses are FLAT OUT being Bullied into believing everything is already approved, just like last year!  Local businesses are losing money with this proposed event!
 
   Again, this event needs to be relocated to an area that will not impact registered boaters safe voyages.   Compromises have not been explored- but should.  Let both sides win.  Please be an ambassador and build positive relationships with local boaters.  

   Endeavour to BUILD BRIDGES with the local boaters, rather than BATTLE THEM.

If they answer truthfully, they will learn no permits have been issued and I would be requesting a refund. Integrity and character are still important, arent they?

Now that doesn't sound so bad, until you consider you're either leaving the Venice inlet to go to stump pass or vice versa. That's a considerable distance of open water.  Truth be told there are many boaters out there that don't have the knowledge to navigate open waters if the weather turns for the worst.  So you can see how this affects this area in a very negative manner.

This race is a 5K race.  The course at Nathan Benderson Park is a 2K course.  The timing of this race provides an excellent starting point for the Head Race (or 5K) season.

Last year it was great fun to see the number of people enjoying the race on both sides of the intracoastal - some were sitting on their own lawns and some were sitting/standing on the sidewalk.

I realize this could cause an inconvenience for some but I think there are many times when we give up convenience to support good causes.  I believe our youth are a good cause.

The sport of rowing has become an important part of youth athletics in our 3 county area and to have an event that can showcase the sport for local youth and parents to see plays an important part in the health of the sport in our area. As adults we often go off about getting our kids off the sofa and away from video games, well this sport is the very opportunity parents are looking for. This sport is one that requires effort and dedication by its athletes and the sport provides our youth rowers with camaraderie as well as a sense of being part of a team and working for the good of the team, not just themselves. 

We shouldn't overlook all of the other sports in our area that have facilities (fields & stadiums) on public lands, in our parks and our schools. These dedicated facilities are underutilized and off limits to the very residents of the counties where they are located, even though their tax dollars paid for these facilities and continue to pay for their upkeep.   All the Sarasota Scullers are asking is that a small portion of the Intercoastal Waterway be closed for a 10 to 12 hour time span. That leaves another 364 days and 12 hours for full utilization of the Intercoastal by our boating community. 

The concerns of those who feel their businesses are in jeopardy and that the revenues will be negatively impacted should consider what happens at youth rowing events. As teams from surrounding communities around the State of Florida come into the Venice area for the regatta an amazing thing happens, parents very often travel with their team and spend money in those areas. They make it a day or two where they frequent restaurants, local beaches, shops and department stores to get the things they forgot to bring like lawn chairs, water snacks etc.   Another consideration that has not been mentioned is that by noon time the regatta will already be half over. 

Let's try to work together to not only allow the regatta go off as planned but let's try to work together to see if we can't come up with some creative ideas to make the event more than just a regatta. Let's not gripe about it, but somehow look for somebody or something that can make it more like a local event. That might include those very businesses that feel the regatta will not help their business. Maybe those restaurants and stores could have a booth set-up to sell their food or maybe help create a goodie-bag for the rowers that could include a coupon or menu from their restaurant or information about their businesses. All I'm saying is let's do this for our kids, let's showcase our wonderful area and let's get creative to include resources beyond just the rowers and their families. In closing, many years ago the cities of Boston and Cambridge MA fought to prevent having a regatta called the Head of the Charles Regatta on the Charles River in the Fall. Well somehow it happened and today it is the largest single regatta in the USA and the world with thousands of rowers and upwards of 500,000 spectators annually! I'm not saying that's what we are going for, but just imagine what we can do if we work together. Let' support our kids and have a little fun in the process!  ",,,,,,,

First and foremost, there is a multi million dollar rowing facility at Benderson Park specifically for this purpose. Having the contest there proposes no inconvenience to anyone.
To the contrary, having this on the intra coastal negatively affects many such as:

The intra coastal is akin to a public highway much like Interstate 75. Would the Interstate be closed between two exits by special permit for a bike race or marathon during the peak hours of the day?

The negative affect to recreational and commercial boaters would be incalculable both financially and physically.

The potential hazard of forcing all craft to engage the Gulf to continue on a journey north or south would have yet to be known perils facing uncertain sea conditions and inclement weather with no viable flight to safety. We all know many recreational boaters can be less than prudent in their opinion of their seamanship nor the capabilities of their vessel.

A negative effect would prevail for local businesses that rely on dockside patrons, even those not directly between the bridges because it would halt and discourage any travel that day.

The waterway is right to everyone 24/7 not just a select few.

I am certain that a committee came up with this brilliant idea without caring about the impact to hundreds of citizens. Imagine if you will a cruiser navigating from ,say, Pine Island Sound traveling north for a weekend getaway without knowledge of the shutdown. They need to retreat to Stump Pass ( difficult to navigate) or stay at anchor for several hours before being able to proceed on their way. What do they do for rest, bathroom facilities ( if no head onboard), food , water, medical emergency etc.

This is a selfish and short sited plan all for the purpose of a fun competition ( to them) with no regard for others.

I am certain that you will get positive comments motivated by those not seeing a total picture or not caring.

I repeat, it isn't like  they don't have  a perfect option to formulate a fun competition....BENDERSON.

PLEASE don't bend to the will of a few myopic individuals to the potential massive inconvenience of hundreds if not thousands.",,,,,,,

While it is an amazing venue, Nathan Benderson Park provides rowers with a completely different experience.

Two of the largest regattas in the country in Boston, MA and Chattanooga, TN attract thousands of athletes and significant sponsorship. 
My primary rowing club is in Pittsburgh, PA. I started guest rowing at SCRC a couple of years ago, and had no idea how lovely the area is. But rowing attracted me to Sarasota, and now a bunch more of my teammates have (at my urging) traveled to Sarasota to row with SCRC and race at NBP.

I strongly feel that the proposed ""Battle of the Bridges"" on Sept 28th,2019 presents a grave SAFETY PROBLEM to all local boaters. 

 In light of another missing boat this week with 2 Firefighters missing on the open seas, the Coast Guard is proposing to FORCE boaters who travel in the ICW from Shamrock Park to include Fisherman's Wharf Marina, to go out into the Gulf of Mexico to get to there desired destination.

There are quite a few weekend boaters who will not know about this shutdown. A number of boaters in smaller crafts will be forced to use Stump Pass.What if there are high winds and bad sea's in the Gulf on that day? Will the Coast Guard assume responsibility for mishaps? Will the City of Venice do the same if there are bad sea's and another lost boat and crew?

On a financial note, local business within the area of the shutdown will not be able to serve their customers on a SATURDAY in the  area's of shutdown .I am a FREEDOM BOAT CLUB MEMBER and I will not be able to use MARINE MAX'S Harbor to go out boating. There are 400 BOATS in that marina as well.No one will be able to use the public ramp at the Train Station on a Saturday as well. 

The Sarasota Scullers have the Benderson Park Rowing Facility built for them, why not use that location and not cause the closing of the ICW ?

In summary, This is a Safety Issue as well as a financial disaster to local business, as well as use of PUBLIC WATERWAYS for exclusive private use.

This regatta is about Venice and helping put it on the map. It's also about showing off and marketing that our waters are safe to be in and welcoming (red tide has impacted this perception). If you have attended any of the regattas throughout Florida - or anywhere else in the country - you would know that if you're welcoming and offer a safe waterway, thousands of people will come. They will experience the city, it's people, stay at hotels, buy food at grocery stores - or more often, restaurants - and see your business. Visitors won't see any of Venice if they're staying near UTC and spending time and money there, near Nathan Benderson. Saying 'go do this thing in Sarasota because it's nicer than here' is like saying, 'go spend time and money at UTC and the restaurants and hotels around there, not here in Venice.' I don't understand how people don't see this net value. Businesses pay hundreds/thousands of dollars on marketing; this event will bringing people from all over - far and near - to businesses in our area in ways other marketing never will. The business upside doesn't even touch on the obvious benefit of supporting our local youth - and youth from all over. You have a unique thing here in Venice - this part of the intercostal is curved and just the right length to test rowers in very different ways than a straight course does. Nathan Benderson is like drag racing, whereas Venice's Battle of the Bridges 'head race' is more like motocross; both skills are needed for our growing rowers to compete and win nationally and internationally.",,,,,,,

This comment is submitted within the comment period which ends September 3, 2019. 

The closure of a federal waterway on a Saturday for 12 hours, with the boat ramp being closed the night before at 6pm is an excessive amount of time to commit to a youth race that will likely not provide a significant economic boost to the local economy. Instead, it will prevent any charter captain, recreational fisherman or recreational boater from enjoying their right to the waterway.  Not everybody in the area is retired and for those of us that are still working, we look forward all week to dropping the boat off the lift at the house, picking it up at the marina or launching at the public boat ramp.  None of these will be an option for us if the ICW closure is implemented.

There are numerous more viable options in Sarasota and Charlotte County including the mega million $ facility that was built to accommodate this event in Sarasota.  This facility struggles financially and would benefit from an event being held there. If Benderson is not viable for the event, there are large swaths of open water far from the ICW in Sarasota Bay and Gasparilla Sound that could accommodate this event, with virtually no impact on the 1000's of boaters, jet skiers and other water enthusiasts.  

Holding this event on a Federal Waterway (similar to I-75 for boaters) on a weekend is short sighted, selfish and the economic impact will not offset the immeasurable damage done to the local boating community, Marinas, bait stores, waterfront restaurants and the like.  

Finally, and maybe most importantly is the fact that if this closure occurs it will force all boaters to move out to the Gulf of Mexico if they wish to navigate north or south of Venice.  Not all boats and not all captains are capable of operating a vessel in rough water conditions and if this closure occurs, the safety of these boaters could be put in jeopardy depending on the weather conditions.  All for what? A few bucks?  This is not about the kids. The youth would have no idea if they were competing on a closed Federal Waterway or in the open flats of Sarasota Bay/Gasparilla Sound. 

It is time to seriously reconsider this events location, timing and closure of a Federal Waterway to benefit a select few of the areas wealthy families and friends, while harming vast numbers of people who rely on the use of the waterway for business and pleasure.

II. Background, Purpose, and Legal Basis:46 USC 70034, specifically subsections B (3) (4) (5)(6)(7) All of these subsections deal with public and business input.  Emphasis on subsection (7) which reads, advisory committees consisting of all interested segments of the public when the establishment of such committees is considered necessary because the issues involved are highly complex or controversial.   80+ comments on the Federal Registry in week 3 of 4 is unprecedented and proof this is highly controversial.
IV. Regulatory Analyses:Section IV(A)- Executive Order 12866  United States requires benefit-cost analysis for any new regulation that is economically significant, which is defined as having an annual effect or adversely affect[ing] in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs or creating an inconsistency with other law or any of several other conditions.  Furthermore agencies are required to engage in prior consultation with both private and public stakeholders before drafting notices of proposed rulemaking and ensuring they have at least 60 days for public comment.  Of 80+ comments received a significant number deal with negative economic impact on businesses.  For this reason alone, this permit should be denied.
 Executive Order 13563 Section 2(B) To the extent feasible and permitted by law each agency shall afford the public a meaningful opportunity to comment through the Internet on any proposed regulation, with a comment period that should generally be at least 60 days. At the very least THIS comment period should be extended to the full 60 days required to fully evaluate the economic impact and due process.
    Exec. Ord 13563 Sec. 4 - Flexible Approaches:Certainly a schedule could be established allowing vessel traffic to transit the race course with an escort hourly or between race heats.  A Reasonable compromise would be if a total of six or more vessels are awaiting transit at either end of the course they be allowed to pass hourly with an escort at Slow Speed/Minimum Wake. By now race organizers know how many entries have been received.  This data could be used to shorten the closure of the ICW to a more reasonable time period.  12 hours is unreasonable, especially considering the failure of last years entries and lack of spectators.
Section IV(B) Impact on Small Entities.  The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, 5 SC 601-612, specifically 605 (B) has been applied incorrectly.  It requires Federal agencies to consider the potential impact of regulations on small entities during rulemaking. The term small entities comprise small businesses, not-for-profit organizations that are independently owned and operated and are not dominant in their fields, and governmental jurisdictions with populations of less than 50,000. According to the latest (2018) US Census, the City of Venice has a population of just 23,376. https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/venicecityflorida,FL/PST045218

The Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this proposed rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.  This is erroneous and validated by the public comment section.   To date no less than 21 comments have been received on the negative business impacts.  Many comments involve multiple businesses.  This is unprecedented and an oversight that mandates the denial of this Permit.

Section IV (F) Environment
The NEPA and EPP are flawed.  As can be read in ATTACHMENT A, the agency representative does not appear to like boats and the written words speak for themselves.  A new EPP must be submitted by an entity other than Mote, preferably with one appointed by the USCG, ACOE or FWC.  

Just as in last years event there will again be dozens of mooring balls and lane markers affixed to the sea-bed with heavy weights and ropes tied to buoys (see attachment B & C) that will pose an obvious danger to marine life, especially manatees and sea turtles that are still hatching on area beaches. This year is the highest hatch rate for turtle nests according to Mote Marine:
https://mote.org/media/uploads/files/2019_Weekly_Summary_for_Week_34.pdf
Manatees are thriving along this specific stretch of the ICW and seen daily.  Their numbers are growing to a point they have been downgraded to Threatened.

In addition to the weighted buoys and ropes affixed to the bottom, the temporary floating dockage that will be erected into the ICW the day prior to the event will also have a negative impact on sea life. These numerous obstacles placed in the path of marine life for 12 to 24 hours will certainly be detrimental to their well being.  An unbiased EPP should be re-submitted and reconsidered by Legal prior to issuance of any permit.

To whom to may concern,
	
	Please find below my comments on the proposed event Battle of the Bridges to be held on the ICW in the city of Venice Florida.
 
	Section II of the supplementary information leaves the impression that this event WILL happen. By what authority can this private entity close a 3.5 miles section of the Intracoastal Waterway? This section of waterway is an extremely busy section, especially on weekends, providing the only safe passage between the Venice Inlet & Stump Pass. The event closes this passage for 12 hours. 

	Under section IV part A, Provisions need to be made to provide reasonable, timely and safe passage of recreational & commercial vessels. 

	Part B, many businesses will be adversely affected by this event, Two large Marinas, several boat rental businesses & boat clubs will be SHUT DOWN for the day. Charter boats that utilize this waterway will be SHUT DOWN for the day. 

	Part C is most concerning given that if the impact of last years event is being used to justify this years closure one must document the fact that we were in the middle of the worst RED TIDE event in 15+ years last year. I do not believe a true analyses of the vessel traffic has been done, therefore the true impact this event will have on the recreational boating public is unknown. 

	Given the deceptive unethical manner in which last years event planning was kept from the recreational boating public, along with the shortening of the comment period from 30 to 15 days by the USCG, I feel a reexamination of this whole event is in order. 

	Given the fact that a public information request last year to the City of Venice on this matter was answered with in 2 days with full documentation & my PIR to the USCG (2018-CGFO-02757) still to this day has not been answered how can I not feel that this whole thing does not pass the sniff test.

	In conclusion, as a life time Florida resident & recreational boater I am personally adamantly opposed to this proposed rule that will allow the closure of the ICW for a period of 12 hours (6am to 6pm) on a Saturday. 

Respectfully Submitted,
Patrick E. McCarthy

Please review last years USCG Battle of the Bridges After Action Report -16751 Authored by Z.R. Gray, BMC.  Please pay particular attention to Section 8, Sponsor Contact.  Read the very last sentence carefully, because it is true.  You were played.  
Please also review section 10 (d) as well.  Please tell the boating taxpayers why a boat crew was run to fatigue. I ask, did this row boat race compromise the ability of the USCG to respond to other marine emergencies.  SEMPER PARATUS, remember.  Multiple crews should be assigned to this event simply because of the travel and event time alone.  CG crews should not be placed in situations where underway times exceed five hours.  
I also ask, WHY are taxpayers paying for USCG personnel for extended periods of time  for a private club when the Club Sponsor is paying for local police vessels.  The event sponsor should PAY for all USCG Assets and personnel should this incomprehensible permit be approved.
Any Closure of the waterway will cause inexperienced, under equipped boaters into the open Gulf of Mexico.  Somebody is GOING TO inherit that liability.  Is the City of Venice, Sarasota Scullers, or US Rowing going to step up and write checks.  It says right on the permit in Section 2 that USCG is not responsible for the safety of transient craft in the area or the safety of real and personal property in the area.  The responsibility rests solely with the sponsor of this event.  Digest that. Just based on the costs of rescue assets (see attachment A), the costs for a marine rescue CAUSED BY THIS EVENT will far exceed the insurance policy submitted, and rather quickly.
To all of the cheerleaders saying that rowing is great for the kids, etc.  You are correct.  Rowing is a great character builder. This sport is fantastic for our youth. No question. Having this event on a Federal Highway and shutting down a boater funded boat ramp for two days is simply wrong.  If Benderson is not designed for a Head-Race thats your oversight not the boaters. What other races are not compatible with Benderson.  For those saying its only a couple hours, you are simply wrong.  For those on TV https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeUJYkVFJlI saying the boaters should just suck it up-your words validate your ignorance of the boating community.  To those saying this will put Venice on the map, come on.  Have you tried getting into a restaurant, even in the off season here.  To those grand standing that this event was a huge success last year, please.

The event sponsor misled all businesses last year and again this year.  One only has to read the article in the Gondoliar Sun from last year, Jan 29 2018 to see where the sponsor stated the necessary permits were already obtained.
https://www.yoursun.com/venice/newsarchives/opinion-split-on-regatta-on-intracoastal/article_6d64c2ee-85fc-5caf-bee7-c7cfd1ff03dd.html?fbclid=IwAR3isGxEWN1Z__fZDvNk-Gvj4DXekW9Cc8_jwECinpQjxVjnW4R0w54LuAU

Read the paragraph that states the following: There was some chatter among the boaters about trying to fight the use of the waterway, but with the city having signed off on it, the regatta now has all the necessary permissions, including Coast Guard approval, event coordinator  ... said.  That was not only false, but a flat out misrepresentation designed to force businesses and the public to believe everything was approved.  This tactic continued this year as well.

   The boaters tried very hard to work with the event sponsor for both last year and this year.  They were ignored.  The boaters wanted to work with the sponsor to seek a compromise.  To US Rowing, this could have been pulled off with some reasonable compromise and a clearer vision, not fogged by ego.  This is where the controversy originated and should it fail, it will be for no other reason.  Help was offered, several times, but refused.  Not one boater was asked to attend a single planning meeting.  Despite knowing how controversial this was last year alone, not one person planning this event had the foresight to invite anyone opposed to see what the concerns were and seek a middle ground.  Not One.  That is your mistake.  
USCG, the boaters were NOT included in planning this event, this year or last.  Your job is to keep boaters safe, not pander to people that only want it their way.  This is not Burger King.  You had the wool pulled over your eyes last year, please do not let it happen again.  ",,,,,,"https://downloads.regulations.gov/USCG-2019-0508-0087/attachment_1.jpg",

Dear United States Coast Guard, Department of Homeland Security:
I am writing regarding your proposal for a safety zone for fireworks displays; Patapsco River, Inner Harbor, Baltimore, MD on 21 September 2019 for a private fireworks event and 10 November 2019 (with an alternate date of 11 November 2019) for a public event. 
The proposed rule and following action is a necessary one to ensure the safety of life in the harbor of Baltimore, MD. This safety zone will restrict persons and sea faring vessel from entering the prescribed area for 2 hours on each date respectively. This NPRM has been analyzed under Homeland Security Directive 023-01 and Environmental Planning 5090.1 (series) and the studies have found that these actions of a safety zone for four (4) hours in total in a small area of the inner harbor will have minimal impact on the human environment. The directive also states that during the times prescribed within the proposed rule, in and around the port and on the barges thee will be proper signage FireworksDangerStay Away. 
However as a 15 year Army veteran with two deployments to the Middle East in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom, I would like to hear more in-depth from the respective proposing agency concerning the issues that may need to be addressed to ensure the safety of all those in and around the surrounding area:
	Type of security surrounding the inner harbor and the buffer zone on the ground and sea as well as the number of roving patrols on both the land and sea.
	The scope of responsibility from Serpico Pyrotechnics, LLC and The Baltimore Office of Promotion and The Arts of Baltimore, MD respectively. 
	The policing up of the refuse by product of fireworks and excess fallout on water surface if any or a contingency plan to minimize the fallout
	Compensation aspects for security for participating law enforcement and federal agencies to include special duty pay for off duty law enforcement personnel
	The possibility of public intoxication from wedding guests who may wander into safety zone as well as intoxication the public event which may host up to tens of thousands of persons
	Posted signs of repercussions with proposed rule number to be used as a deterrent  to trespassing personnel during proposed times
	Proximity to and sufficient number of first responders (fire and rescue services) both on land and sea
	Lighting for posted signs on land and road blocks or caution signs on surface streets surrounding the harbor for increased traffic warn drivers and pedestrians about the scheduled fireworks displays who may become distracted by the night sky being filled with bright lights and sounds

The existing regulation that this amendment adds to is 33 CFR part 165, title 33Navigation and Navigable waters, part 165 regulated navigation area and limited access area. This amendment is considered to be routine and frequent.  I feel that the language of this proposed rule is clear and concise and accomplishes it goal of notifying the public of its intention and covers all mandated regulation rules. I fully support this amendment and its goals, as I have researched other similar amendment surrounding the same topic of safety zones for firework displays and have found no negative comments after the events in which the USCG has provided security in accordance with its mission to protect Americans and to ensure our maritime safety. Thank you for the opportunity to exercise my right to comment on this proposed rule. Please add my name to your mailing list so I may stay abreast of this project.

Sincerely,
Bryson J. Amaral

Earlier this year, Sunoco Partners Marketing and Terminals located in Nederland, Texas submitted a letter of intent (LOI) with proposed plans to increase the use of an existing dock that is involved in the handling of liquified-hazardous gas (specifically propane and butane). This expansion would lead to an increase in the LNG marine traffic on the Sabine-Neches Waterway which would impact the public. 
This expansion would be monumental considering the dramatic proposed shift from 120 liquified propane and butane ship visits per year to 432 in addition to the 120 liquified ethane ship visits. Marine traffic in the Nederland area would not be minorly impacted, but recreated altogether. However, it is possible for recreational boaters and LHG vessels to safely coexist in the affected environment so long as necessary precautionary measures are taken. This would include the consideration of an alternative approach by Sunoco Partners Marketing and Terminals. This approach, which is similar to the proposal of the Cove Point Expansion Project in 2006 regarding LNG vessel traffic in the Chesapeake Bay, would likely minimize the potential negative impacts on other marine traffic in the Nederland area by encouraging the Coast Guard to instate an announcement program in which the company notifies the people (specifically those interested/involved in the marine affairs of the area), in advance, of the scheduled transit of an LHG vessel. Additionally, Sunoco could attempt to craft a transit schedule with LHG boat carriers that would utilize transit times that are least likely to impact recreational boaters (i.e. Sunday-Thursday, early mornings, late evenings). 
As is considered in all environmentally-steered proposals, we must address the environmental impacts of an expansion of this sort. Research suggests that propane, butane and ethane, the LHGs that are handled by Sunoco in Nederland, TX, are non-toxic, non-caustic and will not create an environmental hazard (Propane 101) if released as a liquid (even in extreme amounts), which is the form that would be onboard the boats that transit the Nederland Port thereby alleviating some of  the environmental concerns related to the increased traffic. 
Because the increased handling of liquefied hazardous gas in the Nederland area would be relatively effortless for recreational boaters to circumvent, would not introduce any additional environmental hazards and would serve as a method of capitalizing the success of Sunoco, the expansion of this American energy company should be allowed in this case.

Since a race will be occurring regardless, it is important that the safety of the contestants and viewers be protected. Also, by protecting the participants, other vessels in the water would also be protected so they do not accidentally hit them. Moreover, the safety zone would last only 30 minutes and if persons or vessels desire to enter the safety zone during that time, they are not permanently excluded, they can contact the Captain of the Port Charleston by telephone at (843) 740-7050, or a designated representative via VHF radio on channel 16, to request authorization. Furthermore, the impact on entities is de minimis and would even protect small entities from liability since swimmers would be within a safe zone and thus, small entities would not be able to crash into them and avoid potential lawsuits.

The Paulsboro NJ bridge operated remotely with a failure message that was not taken seriously contributed to 23,000 gallons of toxic vinyl chloride being release into the Mantia Creek.

NAVTEX is still widely used and despite the fact that ECDIS units have this functionality, the actual radio broadcasts are still widely received, printed, and passed amongst watch standers. NAVTEX broadcasts are often the only record of significant navigation information and warnings for coastwise tugs and ATBs. NAVTEX provides the Mariner with a passive watch for alerts that may be missed on traditional VHF broadcasts. I strongly urge whomever is assuming that this system is not in use to reconsider termination. The termination of systems such as this may have unintended consequences in the marine sphere. A good example of this is the decommissioning of LORAN C leaving a sole reliance upon GPS which is rapidly becoming subject to spoofing and signal corruption.

MF is extremely prone to noise and fading, and the SITOR-B code used for NAVTEX is archaic and doesn't provide adequate throughput or error correction.  However, I am opposed to only providing navigational warning data by satellite.  INMARSAT receivers may be inexpensive, but having a terrestrial radio backup is still not a bad idea and provides an inexpensive option for recreational boaters like me.  I would suggest that, in addition to the INMARSAT broadcasts, USCG starts providing the navigational warnings included in NAVTEX on the existing HF Marine channels, such as the existing HF-SITOR high seas weather broadcasts.  It could use the existing NAVTEX coding to allow localization, using the receiver message filtering using the current coverage areas (e.g., G - New Orleans (Gulf), A- Miami (South Atlantic/Florida, E - Charleston (Middle Atlantic), etc.)  

The best option, however, would be to modernize both NAVTEX and HF-SITOR to a state-of-the-art HF digital mode, like those developed by radio amateurs over the past 15-20 years, such as MFSK16, Olivia, or MT63. These all provide an asynchronous mode (allowing broadcast vs. handshaking/connection) very robust noise interference, and forward error correction that is superior to SITOR/AMTOR. The existing NAVTEX message format could continue to be used, but the broadcast of data over HF using one of the new modes would allow much wider dissemination from fewer transmitters and more reliable reception.

It is important to recognize that satellite broadcast has drawbacks such as cost, vulnerability to outages due to satellite failure or solar storms, and equipment complexity for which HF can provide complementary capabilities and redundancy.  In addition, the newer HF digital modes allow for much more reliability and functionality than in the past.  ",,,,,,,

Moving to satellite transmission could be an improvement in the service.  The only shortcoming of NAVTEX was the limited reception when on the high seas.

I have a radio receiver that allows me to tune to the NAVTEX frequencies, and then transfer the reports to my computer.  It is not foolproof, but it allows me to keep a record of these reports, which are not easily available away from the coast.  The US has much better weather forecast distribution than other countries, but it is not easily provided to mariners in a format that can be recorded, if they are not close to the shore.  

NAVTEX provides a record of reports that can be reviewed later, compared to one another to discern trends in weather, and to ensure that significant details are not missed.  It should not be terminated.  Providing the service by satellite will make it even harder for recreational boaters to receive this information, because satellite receivers are very expensive and difficult  (in some cases impossible) to install,  and their installation would be unjustifiable for  only this one application.  If the Coast Guard were to transition NAVTEX to a different SSB frequency, that would ameliorate some of the problems, but existing users who have already purchased and installed  dedicated NAVTEX receivers would see those efforts completely lost.  Users would also incur a cost for a subscription to this service from a satellite, and that cost to users is not discussed in the proposal. 

The Coast Guard also needs to think about the experience of shutting down LORAN, which turned out to be, in my estimate, a serious mistake.  The GPS system is wonderful, but it is not foolproof, and there is a need for both diversity and redundancy in the transmission of safety information.  Satellite-based systems are wonderful, but they are susceptible to solar storms, which can knock then all out at the same time, and there is no way to protect them from this damage.

Finally, the argument that parts for NAVTEX transmitters are expensive and hard to find sounds very much like a red herring.  The greatest expenses of NAVTEX and LORAN transmitter facilities are (1) the capital expense of initially setting up the site, and (2) operational staffing costs.  In this day of really cheap electronics, it is hard to believe that it is getting too expensive to replace radio transmitters.  Maybe the Coast Guard can look at all of the various MF transmitters that are installed on ships, and figure out some way to adapt them to the NAVTEX sites.",,,,,,,

As a professional mariner and educator I respectively disagree with terminating MF. Navtex.
MF Navtex is still widely used and is a useful  tool.
It seems counter intuitive to discontinue a system that provides a level of redundancy for safety information and weather broadcasts for ships at sea.
With cybersecurity on the minds of the Maritime industry  I see no harm in having a system that works via radio frequency and not via satellites.

Proposed termination of Coast Guard medium frequency broadcast of Navigational Telex (NAVTEX) and shift to satellite

Cease broadcasting over MF will provoke that information contained in NAVTEX broadcasts must turn to be received via 
IMO recognized satellite services, and these equipments INMARSAT fitted on board many ships may be not connectable to 
ECDIS equipment on many ships, which use MF NAVTEX , entering MSI in ECDIS data base automatically (not  time  
consuming manual mode), by mean of a connection to external equipment ECDIS, thereby allowing the NAVTEX can be used 
in conjunction with Integrated Bridge System.

The ECDIS data output connector in the NAVTEX sends received messages to the ECDIS when the data format complies 
by opened message text and can be output to the connected external equipment  ECDIS.

If NAVTEX are to be broadcast via IMO INMARSAT recognized satellite services, this equipment must be prepared to 
connect to external equipment ECDIS, and may need to be reprogrammed or a new refit placement.

My limited experience with Navtex is that is isn't a significant information source on the east coast of the US.  But that's not the case in other areas such as the Mediterranean with the many mountains chains channeling weather.  And, that may be the same on the NW US coast and Alaska as well.  

Navtex has several advantages that HF weather reports lack.  The broadcasts are localized (200 miles) which in mountainous areas, can be very important.  And that kind of data is what the mariner needs.

It is too bad that the US maritime community hadn't caught on to the significant transmission data that could be available and is available elsewhere.  Probably the main reason it didn't catch on here was because the data provided was lacking and often of limited value.  While the data input is not your doing, it needed someone to do a quality job with the input and it didn't get it.

It must be embarrassing to transmit abysmal data rather than meaningful weather.  However, this proposed correction of terminating the broadcasts doesn't correct the fundamental and underlying issue which should be addressed.

I do believe that a satellite based system should be required equipment once such an international system is in place.

However, I also recognize the inherent risk to reducing the safety of navigation by eliminating coastal radio broadcast systems such as NAV-TEX. I was not a proponent of eliminating LORAN-C in the 1990's either. These are costly systems to maintain and operate, but they have at least one quality which satellite based systems cannot replace and it is signal strength.

Satellite signals, such as with GPS can be hijacked by stronger signals, potentially sent by competing foreign satellites, aircraft, submarines, other vessels, land stations, etc. A signal strong enough to hijack a satellite signal can still be too weak to be easily identified and traced by radio signal detection equipment. For example, a passenger on a cruise ship might do so using a cel phone or laptop and transmitter, and that would only take a very weak signal. In order to hijack the old loran system, and I would argue the same for today's NAV-TEX, the hijacker's signal would need to be strong enough that it might be detected.

In an age of information warfare, it seems to me that a good national defense requires that funding be provided for powerful land station-based radio navigation and navigation information communication systems as well as satellite based system. I believe both are important, and are worth funding.

One last point. I recommend that the US Coast Guard be split up. Navigation and Vessel-related services should fall under the Department of Transportation. Conversely, the national defense, drug interdiction, etc should fall under Department of Homeland Security. While maritime transportation is vital to the national economy, and the economy is key to a good national defense, management of transportation systems and defense are two different skill sets with different priorities. They should be able to coordinate security efforts, but individually, they would be more effective and efficient post-divorce, so-to-speak.  I don't believe funding for navigational equipment, aids to navigation, etc. should be robbed in order to fund warships, drug interdiction, or anti-terrorism activities, etc (and vice-versa). ALL are important, but a US Coast Guard that can drain funds in one pocket (security) only to reach into the other (marine inspection, mariner licensing, aids to navigation, etc) will result in diminished capabilities all around.

The US Coast Guard remains the most important and appreciated of the US Armed Services to me personally. Their long history of wearing multiple hats toward the protection of mariners & shipping, trade, commerce, and the homeland is amazing, and I thank them for their commitment to honorable service.

The loss of such a valuable service as the NAVTEX would have a great impact on many small vessels who safely navigate the coastal waters and rely on NAVTEX for weather information.
The cost of an off the shelf commercial MF transmitter is not so high these days and possibly cheaper than trying to maintain the old tube equipment that I imagine is in use today.
 One of the key successes of the NAVTEX system was its wide coverage and easy of reception/ decoding by 'casual' users.
A NAVTEX receiver can be as simple as a MF radio and a connection to a mobile phone. I've used such a setup myself and it is cheap, reliable and extremely useful.

If you do decide to shut down the service, then it is only logical to have a parallel phasing-out of the existing system and phasing-in of the satellite system. Over a period of years you can slowly switch the MF off.
This will give hundreds ( or even thousands..) of MF users time to acquire new receivers and get them installed and tested, before the old systems is switched off.

It is perfectly understandable that you need to minimize costs and that old equipment is more expensive/difficult to repair...but please consider that often older equipment was in fact designed to be repaired and most modern equipment is desigend to be thrown-away instead of repaired,
(This greatly increases the costs of long term ownership).

I shall be sad to see a wonderful service that I have used for many years disappear. I hope you will reconsider.

Instead of terminating the service, it will be better to modernize it.

In parts of the world like Europe, there is a reliable NAVTEX coverage available. All boats, including small recreational boats, can receive the messages. The equipment which is required is small and not too expensive. Inmarsat-C equipment is quite bulky and for some boats hard to install.

The problem with Inmarsat-C transmission is that it covers a very large area. This makes it difficult to analyse which messages are important for a certain area where someone is. By making specified NAVTEX area's you can send messages which are only relevant for that area. Anyone can understand those messages and directly know that these are important for them. 

I think it will be better to just use NAVTAX for coastal purposes only. Limited the service area to about 24 nm from the coastline. Specify the limits of the area's and make sure that you cover the whole coast. Send meteo and safety messages which are relevant to that area. 

In the mean time consult with IMO and other nations if an alternative system can be set up. I am thinking of a digital NAVTEX system which works via satellite and can be integrated in ECDIS and other electronic chart systems. That will be a better alternative then switching to Inmarsat-C.

I view this as just another step in the long road since the 1990s close down of the 500 Kc/s CW distress systemand supporting Coast Station system that reduces the level of Safety at Life at Sea. Every step puts the lives at sea at greater risk.Specifically the reliance on unreliable satellite systems has severly degraded SOLAS in that ships near by do not hear Distress or other related traffic.. Point of fact GMDSS coverage is unreliable due to both patchy signal and inability to ""point"" under high-wind/storm conditions. Under such condition when sat-coms drop out is exactly   MF NAVTEX comes into it's own. This service should be extended not disbanded as both the U.S Coast Guard and the U.S Goverment should be pushing for expansion not abandoning it.

I am retired USCG and now a member of the USCG Auxiliary.  In total, I have almost 30 years of experience at land and sea with radio communications, both as a Professional and as an Amateur.

I realize, like anything else, that it costs money to maintain a system.  It's troublesome to figure out if there is any return on investment when it comes to determining if the system is of value to those that use it.

We are one good solar-flare away from losing satellite connectivity.  The USCG already divested itself from LORAN-C, which was a HUGE mistake, instead of investing in e-LORAN.  LORAN is far less susceptible to interference than satellite.  It would make for a great back-up to GPS in the event of natural or man-made interference or failure.  Likewise, terrestrial communications, especially on MF/HF, has been a proven communications medium for decades. Having an alternate means of communications to satellite is key to overall communications success.

I do not concur that parts are hard to find.  There are still companies that produce MF transmitters.  I think it would be very short-sighted of the USCG to abandon MF NAVTEX in favor of satellite.  If anything, I would recommend investing in its replacement, NAVDAT like the Europeans will be using.  In both cases, equipment for end-users is much less expensive compare to satellite-related equipment.

So, I am not in favor of shutting down NAVTEX.  Too many mariners that do not fall under the  GMDSS umbrella still use it and the non-satellite components of that system.  Furthermore, terrestrial communications aren't affected nearly as bad as satellite services can as discussed before.  Please don't let NAVTEX suffer the same fate of LORAN.",,,,,,,

I am a ""recreational mariner"" who often operates outside of Sea Area A1 which is covered under USCG Rescue 21 facilities out to 20 nm offshore. I regularly travel from South Florida to the Northern & Central Bahamas which is located in Sea Area A2. As of Aug 2013, the United States has no Sea Area A2 service.  The US Coast Guard ceased 2 MHz infrastructure effective 1 August 2013 and the MF 2182 kHz International Distress frequency is no longer ""watched"" by USCG ""watch standers"". Most other countries still ""watch"" 2182 kHz except the USA! 

As you know, NAVTEX is an international automated medium frequency (518 kHz) direct-printing service for delivery of navigational and meteorological warnings and forecasts, as well as urgent marine safety information to ships. It was developed to provide a low-cost, simple, and automated means of receiving this information aboard ships at sea within approximately 200 nautical miles of shore. It basically provides marine navigation and weather information for Sea Area A2 operators. 

When I am outside of Sea Area A1 and 60 nm off the Florida coast, my only reliable delivery of navigational and meteorological warnings and forecasts, as well as urgent marine safety information to ships is from my 518 kHz NAVTEX receiver which sends me information 6 times a day along with any immediate Notices To Mariners. NOAA weather on VHF is out of range.

Please do not terminate this service! It provides a low cost important source of marine information and I can not afford a ""satellite"" NAVTEX service!

While EMP, or ""Electro-Magnetic Pulse"" generated by a hostile power against the United States or our neighbors, can easily destroy satellites, EMP does little to impact signals in the 400 to 600 kHz radio spectrum where NAVTEX is broadcast.

If it fails at a critical life safety moment, the results can be very serious.  

Terrestrial radio systems make excellent back up for satellite systems, and should not be abandoned.  A good communications receiver, a modem, and any laptop computer configured with appropriate software is all that is required on the ship.

...
Included herein are the main points of our submission. The attached file includes the complete comments that were approved by a Working Group consisting of designated representatives of both organizations. 
...

  1. U.S. Withdrawal from Existing GMDSS Services. Recognizing the stated budgetary reasons for the proposed change, and the fact that no decision has yet been made, the Working Group never the less finds it unfortunate that the U.S. as one of the most prominent members of the IMO and also one of the best able to meet its financial obligations, finds it necessary to withdraw from part of the International NAVTEX Service, and terminating U.S. participation diminishes the whole service. This was clearly the case when the U.S. earlier withdrew from providing the International MF-DSC GMDSS coastal services that provided Ocean Area A2 GMDSS coverage, again due to a budgetary shortfall.

 2. Recommend Extending Response Period. The Working Group also feels that the 60 days provided for comment is inadequate to reach many components of the maritime community. SOLAS ships already watch satellite broadcasts of Maritime Safety Information (MSI) but the smaller non-SOLAS vessels that use NAVTEX voluntarily are hard to reach in such a short time through the print media which need a longer lead time to reach their far flung clients.  Therefore a comment period of 120 days is recommended. The Working Group is also of the opinion that any shift to satellite broadcasting of coastal MSI should not commence before the U.S. sponsored Iridium system begins IMO approved MSI broadcasting via its SafetyCAST system. 

 3. Increased Cost to Government of Satellite MSI Broadcasting. While the option of satellite broadcasting may be technically feasible, it would also come at a significant and at present indeterminate recurring cost to both the Coast Guard and the National Weather Service (NWS).  The NWS has not considered any additional expenditure.  The volume of U.S. coastal NAVTEX broadcasts is believed to greatly exceed the volume of U.S. high seas SafetyNET broadcasting via Inmarsat. Further adding to this cost is the need to duplicate all of the Inmarsat broadcasts on the other new IMO recognized satellite system, Iridiums SafetyCAST. 

 4. Increased Cost to Vessels to Receive Satellite MSI Broadcasts. Vessels receiving MSI via satellite broadcasts are not charged for the service but must pay for acquiring the necessary equipment This is not considered a problem for SOLAS class vessels which are already equipped to receive both NAVTEX and Inmarsat SafetyNET broadcasts but smaller voluntary vessels will need to acquire equipment to receive the satellite broadcasts. For comparison purposes the current cost of a basic NAVTEX receiver is around $750. The estimated cost of Inmarsat-C terminals ranges from $2500 to $6500 plus installation and any annual fees involved. The cost of a new GMDSS certified Iridium terminal is unknown but is probably in excess of $3000 plus installation and an annual fee. It has also been determined that a new GMDSS certified Iridium terminal would be required to receive SafetyCAST broadcasts rather than existing non-GMDSS terminals. These voluntary craft are the most vulnerable and it would be a shame if they decided to opt-out of receiving satellite Maritime Safety Information (MSI) due to the cost.

 5. Alternatives to Satellite Broadcasting of MSI. The Working Group has also briefly looked at several alternatives to terminating NAVTEX broadcasting that should be considered but most would require extensive study to determine feasibility and many would appear to be more costly than rehabilitating the NAVTEX system. Instead, we feel that a rigorous cost benefit analysis emphasizing the cost to users should be undertaken.

 6. Cost Benefit Analysis Recommended. It does not appear that a cost benefit analysis of the proposed coastal MSI broadcasting options has been conducted and it is strongly suggested that this be undertaken before making a final decision. Any cost benefit analysis should compare the cost of refurbishing and running the existing USCG NAVTEX infrastructure compared with the cost of implementing and running an alternative solution, which should include not only the cost of broadcasting the information over both SafetyNET and SafetyCAST, but also the cost to mariners and especially recreational boaters, of having to purchase new equipment to replace their existing NAVTEX terminals and pay for an annual service plan.

This comment was approved in scope and general approach by the GMDSS Task Force at its meeting on 19 September 2019 and the RTCM at its Board Meeting on 16 September 2019 and refined with final editing by the Working Group of designated representatives of both organizations on 8 October 2019.",,,,,,"https://downloads.regulations.gov/USCG-2019-0702-0052/attachment_1.pdf",

The greatest impacts will be to the smaller, more vunerable vessels.

I find NAVTEX an invaluable resource which is far superior to reliance on VHF or MF voice broadcasts for weather and marine safety information. Much valuable information is currently transmitted in a simple fashion via NAVTEX and received by thousands of vessels equipped for reception. 

While there is no question that IMO satellite services can provide more reliable international delivery of navigational, meteorological warnings, forecasts, and urgent maritime safety information, it is NOT a substitute for NAVTEX. The USGC should be upgrading NAVTEX while also enabling IMO Satellite services. Do both.

I believe this proposal speaks to general dilapidated infrastructure of the entire marine system. We routinely go months, sometimes years, with broken weather bouys, navigational aids, transmitters, etc.; all within some of the most dangerous and busiest waters in our country. Please do not let this cost saving measure further degrade the safety of the fleet.

     I was employed for more than thirty years as an Electronic Engineer at a company whose main purpose was to manufacture and sell weather data equipment. The products included Wefax and Navtex receivers.  One of my duties included an assignment to evaluate Navtex active antennas. 

     Upon my return from the assignment, I continued to evaluate both active and passive antennas.  Navtex Text (not limited to) includes weather data, weather alerts, whale locations and navigational problems, such as buoys out of location and/or non- operational.  The mariners on board ships and boats depend on important Navtex messages.  Discontinuing Navtex transmissions would place these seafaring individuals at risk.  

     Through the elimination of the Navtex transmission, the mariners would be forced into acquiring new equipment. This would include the cost of installation for a receiver and antennae in order to receive this data by satellite. The cost to receive this data transmission would be extremely expensive per minute. 

 In my opinion, the Navtex data should continue for the health and welfare of these Marines.

MF NAVTEX system may seem like an un-necessary cost to maintain in the face of current Inmarsat and up coming Iridium GMDSS availability. However the safety would be greatly reduced for voluntarily equipped private, and commercial vessels. There are thousands of NAVTEX equipped vessels and many more look at the service every day. The average NAVTEX receiver can be had for under $1000 while a GMDSS access point can often exceed $5000 making it a cost many mariners would not expend.

It seems to be poor judgement to reduce the safety of the oceans by going exclusively to satellite.

Having used NAVTEX for the last 21 years, and relying upon it daily aboard ship; I can testify to its critical value.  I strongly urge decision makers to keep the system operational.   

NAVTEX is our primary warning re: localized military operations during busy coastal transits.  NAVTEX broadcasts have repeatedly enabled Captains to alter course to avoid confusion and areas of Military bombing and other exercises.

NAVTEX Weather forecasting reaches well beyond 100 nautical miles and is clear and timely.  Receiving updated weather warnings in this time of climate anomalies and change is at the heart of marine safety.  

Weather Warnings and Forecasts are especially important as new low pressure systems pick up speed and now travel more than the previous 20 knots as per two decades ago.  Now hurricane and storm force lows (the large systems) can travel at 30 to 40 to 55 knots.  Add storm movement speed to the internal storm winds and see that the mariners at sea must safely respond and navigate around increasingly unstable and fast moving weather situations.   Thus timely weather forecasting is more important than ever before and we should only be adding safety precautions that work with proven systems; not consider reducing available means for vulnerable vessels at sea to receive safety broadcasts.

With these increasing weather dangers and anomalies, this is NOT a good time to eliminate a functioning, well-used Marine Weather Forecast system already installed aboard thousands of vessels.  

Also, please consider that NAVTEX SAR (Search and Rescue) messages which actually trigger alarms aboard vessel, these NAVTEX SAR messages directly alert mariners to save life at sea; the original intent of this appreciated NAVTEX system.  Unfortunately incoming EGC Satellite C SAR messages- such as relayed EPIRB Distress messages, do not always trigger alerts and can be missed or overlooked on a busy bridge.  Whereas SAR alerts on the NAVTEX are easily checked to see if any distress is near the ships area.   These potentially Life Saving messages, such as man-overboard, capsized or submerged vessels should NOT disappear into a quagmire of Satellite messages; many of which are not received by numerous local fishing, recreational, cruising or non-satellite equipped vessels.

Pls do NOT reduce the availability of mariners safety information on a well-established and functioning system.  We rely on the NAVTEX broadcasts daily.  May you decide for the improved Safety of Life at Sea to keep this working, valued NAVTEX system intact.

I had a long and persuasive (and pretty boring) response to post.

I reread it again and said to heck with it.

If the U.S. Coast Guard cannot see that doing away with a tried and reliable system that is in use domestically and internationally by many thousands of commercial and recreational users is not a good idea, then nothing I can say will change their minds.

If mariner safety is not important to them then they are in the wrong jobs.

I can come up with reasons not to shut down NAVTEX until the antarctic completely melts, but the short answer is -

DON'T KILL NAVTEX.",,,,,,,

The Garmin inreach system is about the same cost, provides nearly equivalent weather information but doesnt provide safety and other notices that may be included in NAVTEX.  Sirius provides weather info, but at a somewhat increased cost. Again, no safety info, Inmarsat and other sat access systems are too expensive for casual use.

USCG has a finite budget and resources. The use of those resources and budget for NAVTEX needs to be risk assessed against comparable demands with a focus on safety of USCG personnel and the marine community, in particular potential death, injury and property damage as well as operating cost. If USCG has a need to communicate more information to achieve its safety and injury avoidance objectives than the low cost commercial solutions permit, that should be included in the risk assessment.  A proper, complete risk assessment done by experts that doesnt prejudge any particular outcome compared to other similarly risk assessed demands on USCG resources and budget is the best way to make the decision. In this process, the various risk assessments are compared against each other in a risk matrix format, where the risk matrix ranks the options on probability of occurrence on one axis and severity of consequence on another axis. Ideally, any publication of the final determination from USCG on NAVTEX would include the results and details of both the risk assessment and the linked risk matrix outcome.",,,,,,,

At this time, there is only one extremely expensive company authorized, with a 2nd ""soon to come"" (cost, reliability, simplicity all yet unknown).

VHF broadcasts by USCG and by NOAA-NWS aren't reliably received over large portions of Alaskan inland & nearshore waters due to geography/topography & recent reductions in service. To eliminate one reliable method of receiving life-saving info is to derelict the USCG's duty to distribute that information in a manner that actually works for US citizens, not to mention our international treaty obligations.

USCG itself warns that internet-based methods to receive Navtex & other weather/safety info aren't fully reliable, warning it can't influence the reliability of internet delivery. One wonders why USCG believes that private-satellite-based methods will be more reliable, because certainly the USCG won't be able to influence *that* - as opposed to their own proven ability to maintain & broadcast Navtex via terrestrial MF radio bases. There is inconsistency in that logic. If one follows this logic, then VHF broadcasts by USCG & NOAA-NWS to nearshore mariners also should be turned over to satellite services, because surely those terrestrial VHF transmitters are costly to maintain? And yet we certainly hope/assume that this concept would never be considered due to the reliability & track record & low cost & ease to the end-user of receiving VHF. These same arguments apply to MF Navtex as well.

We also wonder why the US is proposing to go a different route than all other GMDSS/SOLAS nations, which aren't changing their delivery method for GMDSS data. If terrestrial broadcast still works well for them, why would the US change our method of cooperation & contribution, in a direction that requires costly eqpt & subscriptions? We should not renege on our international obligations; other nations rely on our cooperation, & our own citizens do the same when navigating foreign waters. This is an example of the US ""going it alone"" when the safer (and more efficient for mariners) path is to continue to cooperate with other nations.

Additionally, this is an example of our federal gov't privatizing an important service to US citizens rather than investing in the -yes, costly- infrastructure required to maintain the service. The result will be that those with plenty of money will have no problem still receiving the Navtex service. The rest of us - well, too bad, we'll have to do without - & our lives and property will be at greater risk than before. Meanwhile, Inmarsat & Iridium are both privately owned companies that will profit from this USCG divestment of responsibility. The profit motive has no place in crucial life-saving services, & the federal gov't certainly should not abdicate its responsibility to citizens so that profit-driven companies can serve only the wealthy.

Meanwhile, whether MF Navtex broadcasts are eliminated or not, we have suggestions either to mitigate the loss or improve the penetration of Navtex data to end-users: Please make GMDSS info available on simple bookmark-able websites that can be accessed via simple low-bandwidth internet-receiving equipment (so, not solely via links on another web page; they need to be simple text, accessible directly with a fixed URL). This type of eqpt, unlike dedicated satellite receivers & services, is less expensive and thus more accessible for small craft operators. These simple-bookmarked Navtex websites should be updated *just* as frequently as the MF radio broadcasts, *and* they should include inland waters of Alaska due to the inconsistency of VHF to reach many inland areas throughout the coast of Alaska - unlike the lower 48 states where VHF can reliably be received from nearly all navigable waters. Regardless of the reliability of internet & regardless of USCG inability to influence that reliability, many mariners do nonetheless receive weather & safety information via internet, especially in Alaska where VHF reception is uncertain as already noted. If USCG considers satellite reliable enough to become the sole means of distributing Navtex, then surely in order to reach as many mariners as possible, Navtex should also be distributed via internet, in a method as easily accessible as possible, & covering as much geography as possible.",,,,,,,

The American Radio Association (ARA) respectfully submits its comments in response to USCG Docket No. USCG 2019-0702, proposing possible termination of MF NAVTEX broadcasts after first assuring the information contained in NAVTEX broadcasts is available via International Maritime Organization (IMO) recognized satellite services. 

American Radio Association was established in 1938.  Our members sail aboard U.S. Flag vessels as Master Radio Electronic Officers and as Electronic Officers on MARAD Ready Reserve Fleet ships and Military Sealift Command ships engaged in the national defense.  As professional communicators ARA members have been supporting safety and distress communications from the days of Morse Code to the present Global Maritime Distress and Safety System (GMDSS).  Shipboard Radio Officers have been at the forefront of communications technology every step of the way.  ARA Master Radio Electronics Officers continue to maintain responsibility for ship-to-shore communications, retaining expertise across a spectrum of high seas communication and navigation systems as well as other shipboard electronics.  ARA is therefore in a unique position to provide an in depth understanding of both emerging satellite systems and the enduring value of NAVTEX for safety of life at sea.

NAVTEX is proven, trusted and relied upon as a world-wide passive receive radio system for Search & Rescue (SAR); Military Exercise; Navigational and Weather warnings. It provides a low-cost, simple, and automated means of receiving information aboard ships and smaller vessels at sea within approximately 250 nautical miles of shore. On its international automated medium frequency MF (518 kHz) NAVTEXs narrow-band direct-printing service is location selectable.  Mariners select appropriate shore-side broadcast station codes to receive marine safety and timely weather warnings specific for their sea location. Additionally, NAVTEXs high frequency, HF 4209.5 kHz broadcasts offer coverage out several thousand nautical miles; thus NAVTEX Maritime Safety Information (MSI) messages touch well beyond coastal waters, reaching well out to sea for offshore fishermen, tugs and barge operators, recreational vessels and offshore sailors around the world. 

This world-wide coverage and easy reception reaches thousands of mariners who rely on it daily.   Such terrestrial radio wave propagation is robust, proven over decades and does not require any subscription fees once the receiving unit is purchased and installed.  Proposing to eliminate NAVTEX is not in the best interest of protecting the global mariners safety net.  NAVTEX terrestrial broadcast for the mariner is akin to an at-sea pubic emergency broadcast service which critically reaches all users as needed.  Removing this service would be like asking the public to no longer count on receiving emergency broadcasts on their own radios, rather require them to set up much more sophisticated and costly equipment for such critical survival information.  Recognizing the considerable investment by thousands of marine users who have bought, installed, learned to use and depend upon NAVTEX is just one significant reason for continuing its use for the safety of life at sea.

A strong Coast Guard communications and safety system requires that funding be provided for powerful land station-based radio communication systems as well as satellite based system. Both are important and worth supporting. 

ARA recommends investing in MF/HF maintenance, repair and upgraded services so that the USCG can be a leader in maritime safety in the years ahead.  We already understand that the equipment for marine end-users is much less expensive compare to satellite-based equipment and NAVTEX is proven to save lives.  After decades of use, mariners can still say it is the most reliable source of weather data and forecasts on board.   Discontinuation of the NAVTEX service would be a withdrawal of a vital safety service. 

ARA strongly recommends NOT to discontinue NAVTEX broadcasts, which would reduce the availability of safety information on a well-established and functioning system.  We rely on the NAVTEX broadcasts daily.   Ending these vital broadcasts in favor of a subscription-based satellite transmission system is not the best option.  We must remember that satellite systems are vulnerable, thus the prudent navigator will rely on a variety of survival communication equipment.  We need to vigilantly guard the safety of our fleet of mariners at sea.  Any new navigational system should only compliment the current system not replace what is proven to work well.

PART 1 OF 2, COMMENTS OF PAUL NEWLAND
THESE COMMENTS ARE ENTERED ONLINE AS TWO SUBMISSIONS BECAUSE OF THE 5000 CHARACTER LIMIT OF THIS ONLINE TEXT ENTRY SYSTEM.

In the public notice as published in the Federal Register regarding Docket USCG-2019-0702, (the Document), in the section titled Public Participation and Request for Comments, it states: We encourage you to submit comments (or related material) on the possible termination of the U.S. Coast Guard's broadcast of MF NAVTEX.  I am not an off-shore mariner, however I accept the invitation provided in the Document to offer my comments on issues and items raised in the Document.   Please consider this an amicus submission, rather than a user submission.

Im trained as an electrical engineer, and in one of my professional endeavors I wrote software to run on a microcontroller that implemented an ASCII<-->SITOR-B code converter, SITOR-B being the data transmission format use for NAVTEX, onto which NAVTEX headers are layered.  I then placed that ASCII<-->SITOR-B code converter, with the help of technician staff at the respective radio stations, into service at several USA based shore stations to broadcast traffic lists via MF and HF radio to ships at sea using SITOR-B mode.  It was a very simple, low-cost system on the transmit side; yet it was also effective.

I agree with RTCM/GMDSS-Task-Force filed comments regarding the need for a cost/benefit analysis before discontinuing USCG NAVTEX transmissions.  It would seem to me that one datum fundamental to the issue of whether USCG should continue or terminate NAVTEX transmissions (not considering possible international treaty obligations) is the USCGs annual cost for NAVTEX transmissions per active NAVTEX recipient.  For example, if it costs USCG $3 million dollars a year to keep USCG NAVTEX transmissions operational and there are only 500 NAVTEX recipients for whom the proposed satellite services alternative is not viable, that would be a cost to USCG of $6000 per NAVTEX recipient.  If the cost per user was actually that high, then termination of USCG NAVTEX transmissions (not considering possible international treaty obligations) could very well be justified.  But *that* is not the rational or reasoning presented in the Document for discontinuing USCG NAVTEX transmissions, nor are data on that issue presented by USCG in the Document.

In the Discussion section of the Document, in paragraph one, the attributes (I presume from the perspective of the USCG) of the NAVTEX system are stated as: NAVTEX provides a low-cost, automated means of receiving this information aboard ships at sea out to approximately 100 nautical miles off shore.  Other commenters on the Document have affirmed the low cost of shipboard NAVTEX decoding devices, and a few others have pointed out that a modest laptop running free software and a modest SSB MF receiver are all that are needed to receive NAVTEX messages (although these ad-hoc receiving systems are not GMDSS compliant, they appear to be useful nonetheless to some NAVTEX users who are not mandated to be GMDSS compliant).  From both the USCG and users comments, it appears to be agreed that the NAVTEX system is low cost.

In the Discussion section of the Document, in paragraph two, there is a sentence that states: The current MF NAVTEX equipment is in dire need of replacement.   I assume that this assessment of dire need of replacement was not delivered by USCG NAVTEX operators or maintainers to their respective managers only within the last few months; I assume its not a recent revelation.  Was it unforeseen years ago by USCG management that at some point in the future that the USCGs NAVTEX transmission infrastructure would need to be updated to some extent? The Document doesnt describe the sequence of events that led to this current situation of dire need of replacement.

PART 2 OF 2, COMMENTS OF PAUL NEWLAND
THESE COMMENTS ARE ENTERED ONLINE AS TWO SUBMISSIONS BECAUSE OF THE 5000 CHARACTER LIMIT OF THIS ONLINE TEXT ENTRY SYSTEM.

In the Discussion section of the Document, in paragraph two, there is a sentence that states: The equipment is antiquated and essential replacement parts are difficult to find and expensive, placing overall operation of MF NATEX at risk.  Is there a USCG memo that has been released to the public that details the specifics of this difficult to find situation?  How difficult is difficult to find?   Does Canada face a similar problem with respect to their NAVTEX infrastructure?  Does Japan, UK, Australia, Germany, Spain, France or Norway?  I realize that these other countrys hardware and software systems may be different than that currently in use by USCG for NAVTEX transmissions, but if USCG current NAVTEX infrastructure is expensive to repair and maintain, then why not use the equipment that is being used in other countries, if those other countries dont face a similar problem? 

I freely admit that I dont understand all the issues that USCG faces with respect to costs to provide NAVTEX transmissions, and costs of maintaining or replacing the associated software and hardware to produce those transmissions.  The primary rational for USCGs proposal to terminate their NAVTEX service as stated in the Document is not a possible perceived high cost per NAVTEX user to produce NAVTEX transmissions, a cost that is borne by USCG, nor is lack of efficacy or utility of the NAVTEX messages delivered to mariners stated in the document as a reason for USCG to discontinue NAVTEX transmissions.  Instead, the stated reason in the Document for terminating USCG NAVTEX transmissions is because essential replacement parts are difficult to find and expensive  That seems to me to be a very weak reason for discontinuing a safety telecommunications service.

Finally, the Document does not address the issue of USCG possibly enhancing or replacing NAVTEX with NAVDAT (https://www.itu.int/dms_pub/itu-r/opb/rep/R-REP-M.2443-2019-PDF-E.pdf ).  In the 2017 Federal Radionavigation Plan ( https://rosap.ntl.bts.gov/view/dot/32801 ) on page 6-3, paragraph three, there is text that states: the USCG has established a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement to develop a prototype Navigational Data maritime broadcast (NAVDAT) system as an enhancement to the existing NAVTEX system.  Is that statement no longer operative?   If USCG is proposing to terminate NAVTEX transmissions in the near future what implications does that have for USCGs intentions with respect to deploying NAVDAT in the next few years?

Respectfully submitted,

Paul Newland

During the last 20 years of my employment I served as the Marine Dissemination Program Manager.  As such I have detailed knowledge of the inner workings of the U.S. GMDSS program.  For a variety of reasons, some of which are outlined below, I believe the USCG's proposal to shift broadcast of Maritime Safety Information (MSI) from NAVTEX to satellite  (Inmarsat-C SafetyNet) is not a viable option. Before any action is taken, the USCG should undertake a cost-benfit analysis fully taking into account the total economic picture and impact to mariners safety.

1) As an alternative to NAVTEX within GMDSS Sea Area A1, although the USCG conducts an MSI broadcast program, this program does not fully incorporate all the MSI relevant to this area, as an in-depth audit would reveal.

2) As an alternative to NAVTEX within Sea Area A1, reception of MSI via VHF requires labor-intensive human intervention 24x7 (as compared to the printed NAVTEX) which is not a viable option for vessels involved in maritime operations such as fishing. Audible data is also easily garbled, misinterpreted or errors made in transcription.

3) NOAA broadcast of weather related MSI via NOAA Weather Radio should not be considered as an option for receiving MSI as GMDSS VHF radios are not required to incorporate NOAA Weather Radio frequencies nor is NOAA Weather Radio a part of the GMDSS.

4) For reasons 1-3 above I believe the USCG was in error in declaring Sea Area A1 areas around the United States. Although the GMDSS carriage requirements for MSI could then be met by the addition of a NAVTEX receiver, the USCG's proposal would now require vessels strictly operating within Sea Area A1 to carry the much more expensive and complex Inmarsat-C transceiver.  Hence all U.S. coastal areas would then have to be defined as Sea Area A3.

5) The proposal by the USCG to terminate NAVTEX does not fully account for the tremendous number of non-GMDSS vessels operating along the coast which equip with NAVTEX voluntarily. A large percentage of these vessels are unlikely to be able to equip with Inmarsat-C given the additional acquisition and recurring costs, complexity, power, size, and weight of this equipment as compared to NAVTEX. 

6) As the largest provider of MSI via NAVTEX, the cost to NOAA in switching to satellite would likely be on the order of $500K or more annually. This cost could double or more with additional MSI providers such as a Iridium. I believe NOAA is unlikely to be able to deal with such a required increase in their capital budget.

7) SafetyNet is a 600 baud system. Does it even have the technical capacity to transmit 2 to 5 times (as a very rough ballpark) the existing level of transmissions? And then if further participants in the GMDSS were to do likewise?  What technical impact would this have on Iridium's proposed service? This all requires careful investigation and coordination internationally.

8) The U.S. NAVTEX services are a part of a larger international GMDSS NAVTEX service.  Consequently terminating U.S. NAVTEX affects and diminishes the whole.  

9) NAVTEX is used globally and transmitting equipment is available. There is no need to force a transition to a different technology at this time. I further believe that alternatives such as NAVDAT are too far on the horizon to be given serious consideration in the near term

Re: Proposed termination of U.S. Coast Guard Medium Frequency (MF) Broadcast of Navigational Telex (NAVTEX) and shift to satellite; Comments on Docket Number: USCG-2019-0702
Date: November 12, 2019

Pacific Environment is a non-governmental (NGO) organization with consultative status at the International Maritime Organization (IMO). As a key organizer among NGOs, we advocate for reducing shipping-related risks to the environment and coastal communities, and for protecting mariners and wildlife, especially in the Arctic. 

Pacific Environment is submitting comments regarding the possible termination of broadcasting Navigational Telex (NAVTEX) over Medium Frequency (MF). While the U.S. Coast Guard is first ensuring the information contained in NAVTEX broadcasts is available via IMO recognized satellite services, a segment of the maritime community will have an upfront cost of purchasing satellite equipment, and continuing operational user costs. 

NAVTEX is widely used in Alaska and around the globe as a safety tool for mariners. It is sensible to keep this system in place. If a change were to occur to satellite, a transition period that gives the maritime public time to purchase satellite receivers for onboard their vessels is critical. 

A valuable use of NAVTEX is in protecting endangered North Atlantic right whales. The Coast Guard issues NAVTEX messages alerting mariners to the location of North Atlantic right whales along the Atlantic seaboard. Consideration of how transition to satellite will affect specific communications from the Coast Guard in real time scenarios are important factors to consider. While satellite is an alternative reporting communications system, not all vessels are equipped with it. 

The Coast Guard states that NAVTEX is a low-cost automated means of receiving navigational and meteorological warnings and forecasts, as well as urgent maritime safety information. The Coast Guard believes the transition from terrestrial broadcast to satellite will allow for better, more cost-effective products in the future. Since this transition will be only in waters under U.S. responsibility, we think it prudent to have the costs come down first. A comparison of the cost of replacing MF NAVTEX with the cost of satellite, plus an identification of who bears the costs in each scenario should be available for the public to review. Vessels that do not have a Global Maritime Distress and Safety System satellite terminal onboard their vessels would be at a disadvantage without the use of a vital safety service such as NAVTEX. 

Thank you for your consideration, and the opportunity to comment.

Every day, the FEC violates the regulations currently in place. The most frequent violation is the regulation requiring the bridge to be up in between trains. Daily, I am told by the tender that they can not raise the bridge as another train in close by. This is always not the case, the train will take another 25 to 40 minutes to reach the bridge. The FEC is trying to save lifts in my opinion. They could have certainly raised the bridge long enough for the waiting vessels to pass in the time available. I repeat, this happens daily.  They also lower the bridge too early. I often wait longer than 10 to 12 minutes with the bridge down with no train in sight. 

Another violation I see often is the 60 minutes in 120 minutes. When they keep the bridge closed between trains, again a daily event, they often exceed the 60 in 120 minutes. This is troublesome because the only repercussions from this will happen if a boater reports the violation. When I am stuck waiting for the bridge often, in between trains, the last thing I want to do is wait to see if the 120 minute rule is violated. I understand that unless a boater calls the violation in , it won't be held against the FEC. I believe this needs to change. Active monitoring and automatic violations needs to be in place so that the FEC will receive a violation every time they violate the regulations, NOT just when a boater calls in the violation. Also, the number and contact info on the bridge for the CG leads you to a confusing Menu and should be a more direct number to report violations.

As a boater, I believe the FEC's use of the New River bridge is far too detrimental to the Marine traffic and navigation of the New River.  In fact, when the Tri-Rail was built, further to the west, they were required to build the Flyover on 95 because the negative effects the trains would have on the Navigation of the New River. Now the FEC is allowed to block traffic throughout the day even further to the east. The FEC's use of the New River bridge is far too detrimental to the maritime traffic and New River navigation. I am disappointed to say the least that the Coast Guard has conceded it's power to the FEC. The benefit to the small number of train users does not warrant the current number of closings of the New RIver bridge.

RE: Federal Register Docket No. USCG-2019-0714: Proposed Drawbridge Operation Regulation; New River, Fort Lauderdale, FL


Dear Mr. Dragon,

I am pleased to submit these comments for the record pertaining to the above referenced Docket and the proposed fixed 120-minute time block.


I have ridden the Brightline train and regard it as a critically needed transportation alternative in South Florida.  A rule should provide flexibility and not create safety issues where trains are forced to halt movement due to a time restriction, blocking highway crossings and preventing first responders from accessing hospitals, fires, accident victims, and a host of emergency incidents

Please give consideration to the needs of surface transportation modes in finalizing your rule and write a flexible rule that offers a reasonable balance between both modes; predictability for boaters and flexibility for train traffic.

Sincerely,

John C. Watson",,,,,,,

Sometimes, the wait times are so long, boats end up tying up at the dock. Other boats just idle causing pollution.

On a side note, as the southbound train pulls into the station, the train track arms go down at Broward Blvd. & SW 2nd St. and go back up again once the train stops in the station. Approx. 1-2 minutes later, the arms go back down again when the train leaves. The arms should not go down as the train pulls into the station.",,,,,,,

The marine industry in Broward County is an $8.9 billion industry which supports over 111,000 workers in Broward County. Moving a 100+ foot vessel up the New River is not a recreational cruise but done for the purposes of commerce, vessel repair and vessel storage. Safe movement of these vessels are very tidally dependent. Tide, current and river congestion make the transport of these vessels up river challenging to begin with. To add to that equation the unknow of the length of down time or operation schedule for the New River railroad bridge creates a grave concern for safe navigation as vessels of levels of maneuverability and sizes from paddle boards to sailboats to motor boats to 100+ foot yachts under tow pile up at the bridge during a closure.

Palm Beach, Broward, and Dade County make up the 6th largest metropolitan area in the country. In order to reduce congestion, improve transportation options and support the free flow of commerce and goods on rail, roads and water we must insist on investments to improve on our citys infrastructure. The FEC bridge is only 4 over the water on the New River. Improving and raising the FEC New River rail bridge would allow marine traffic to flow and would also provide for a raised rail line through the urban core of Fort Lauderdale helping to alleviate traffic congestion on our roadways.

I request the USCG strongly consider and support the overarching principle of the laws and regulations governing bridges over navigable waters of the United States which is to keep them open to avoid unreasonable obstruction of the free navigation of the waterway.

Otherwise they would not have built a bridge that opened. 

Trying to hold vessels for an hour in that small little river that acts as a wind tunnel through these large buildings is an insane and unsafe request, not only with pleasure boat operators but with commercial or large yacht vessel traffic which by the way is the largest single contributor to commerce in Fort Lauderdale.  The people that are making decisions clearly have no experience with this. They should try and hold of large vessel for that long a period of time in one spot. It will create a fatigue factor that will probably result in something bad happening.  
Further that bridge used to have a time clock that allows you five minutes of visual warning before the bridge dropped. That no longer exists and the bridge will start dropping with no visual or audio signal anymore, this has created an extremely dangerous environment that now results in people with small boats racing to beat it the bridge dropping for a train.

Regarding the freight trains, the FEC generally operates on a scheduled basis. Thus there should be some time windows when a bridge opening would not disrupt their trains. The railroad transports important commodities to and from the Ft. Lauderdale and Miami areas and, as such, is an important contributor to the region's economy. Moreover, from the standpoint of public safety, it is most undesirable for a long freight train to have to wait while the bridge is being opened and closed as that would seriously delay vehicular traffic on the road crossings north and south of the bridge, including the heart of downtown Ft. Lauderdale.

FEC passenger trains had used the bridge until 1968 when the service stopped due to a railroad strike and never was resumed. Now throughout the nation citizens and governmental agencies are recognizing the horrible congestion of our highways, especially in areas such as southeast Florida. Rail passenger transportation is a big part of the solution to that congestion problem and the new privately-operated Brightline service on the FEC Railway is a big step in the right direction. On one of my recent trips the train was delayed 15 minutes because of having to wait for a boat. That type of delay is very undesirable and will discourage persons from using passenger rail service, the most environmentally friendly means of travel.

Accordingly, I urge you to work with the FEC and the maritime interests to develop reasonable windows during which the bridge will not have to be opened. In return, the mariners would be rather certain to have a clear shot getting through the bridge during other times.

I might add that I have been a passenger on vessels transiting thru the bridge and do understand their needs. But I emphasize that far more people are impacted when a passenger train is delayed or a freight train must stop in this area.",,,,,,,

I understand that trains must pass freely in order to maintain their schedule but it seems to me that holding the bridge down between two trains which are far apart is unnecessary.  I have experienced this very thing where traffic on the river backs up so that 2 or 3 trains can cross during one closure.  Miami destroyed their maritime industry by over taxation and legislation which didn't support the marine industry.  I moved to Ft. Lauderdale because I thought Broward and the New River were different.  As you know the marine industry in Ft. Lauderdale is worth billions of dollars per year to the local economy.  I believe mass transit options are important for the local population and I support the Brightline but I'm positive that the train does not provide billions of dollars in business for the South Florida economy.  Its a matter of priorities and compromise.  I believe the needs of the local maritime industry and unimpeded New River access should be more important than a train having to pause and wait 3 minutes for the railroad bridge to close on demand for their crossing of the river.

The ""Venice of the Western Hemisphere"" contributes millions to the economy of South Florida.  Business includes diving, chartering, yachting, fishing, tourism, et. al. in addition to housing the largest selection of boat and yacht sales in the western hemisphere, and all forms of maintenance which goes along with vessel ownership and operation.  This draws seasonal and permanent residents and sustains the booming real estate market in Fort Lauderdale.  

I understand the need for the movement of goods and persons via the railway, especially in a region with rapid population growth such as South Florida and I myself also become very frustrated with congested roadways, particularly at rush hour.  However, there needs to be a set of guidelines by which the maritime community can plan and operate.  The proposed regulation will certainly help.  Having the knowledge that the bridge will not cause a delay of more than 60 minutes certainly facilitates business planning. 

Perhaps other strategies could also aid in facilitating the needs of both communities.  From recent experience, the bridge remains down despite 20-minutes passing between trains in some instances.  Perhaps the threshold of opening the bridge between trains is impractically long.  Maybe after a well-designed risk analysis is conducted, a 10-minute threshold could be approved.   Additionally, accurately scheduled train times posted on a public interface would be very helpful.  The boating community may be able to begin adaptation if there is some sort of schedule to the delays i.e. if the bridge is always closed from 1700 to 1800, businesses can conform to this schedule and not waste time with unknown excessively long closures. 

We the residents of Fort Lauderdale are learning to adapt to the recent and rapid development and population growth in this former port-side vacation town.  I believe we can find a solution that assuages both the maritime and shoreside community if we consider creative ideas.

Dear Director Dragon: 

We are writing to provide comments on the proposed test deviation for the regulation related to the Florida East Coast Railway (FEC) Railroad Drawbridge Operation on the New River, Fort Lauderdale, FL, published in the Federal Register Docket Number USCG-2019-0714. The overarching principle of the laws and regulations governing bridges over navigable waters of the United States is to keep them open to avoid unreasonable obstruction of the free navigation of the waterway. Recognizing some vessels must rely on the tides to safely navigate the river. Ensuring that the bridge tender is doing his or her job, maintaining effective signage and lighting, and establishing the ability to communicate through multimedia outlets such as social media and/or reliable apps when problems arise also are all essential to avoid any undue obstruction to the use of the waterway. 

As a member of this community and employed by Wintefest, Inc., it is very important to keep an unobstructed and predictable use of the waterway. It is also important for the regulations to take into consideration changes in schedules to accommodate events which have a large economic impact on our area such as the 48th Annual Fort Lauderdale Boat Parade known as the Seminole Hard Rock Winterfest Boat Parade produced by the not-for-profit 501(c)4 Winterfest, Inc.

 As you can see, this community and events such as the Boat Parade rely heavily on unobstructed access to navigate the New River. This waterway is essential to the economic health of the Greater Fort Lauderdale area and for the safety of those who navigate on the river.

RE: Federal Register Docket No. USCG-2019-0714: Proposed Drawbridge Operation Regulation; New River, Fort Lauderdale, FL

I am pleased to submit these comments for the record pertaining to the above referenced Docket and the proposed fixed 120-minute time block.

Just as the marine industry depends on reasonable access to the New River, the needs of land-based commerce require equitable access to ensure free flow of movement for goods and people.

In developing an operating rule, the Coast Guard must also maintain a reasonable balance between the competing needs of land and waterborne modes of transportation. commerce.  The proposed deviation lacks flexibility and unreasonably hinders land-based commerce.

An overly restrictive rule could create safety issues, forcing trains to halt movement, blocking highway crossings for long periods and preventing first responders from accessing hospitals, fires, accident victims, and other emergencies. 

Both Virgin Trains and FEC Railway are important to our regional economy.  The rule should accommodate the needs of all surface transportation modes, providing predictability for marine traffic by allowing for a designated fixed period in the open position, while providing for flexibility over several hours for regular train traffic.
Thank you for your consideration of my comments. 

Sincerely,
Scott Rivelli

RE: Federal Register Docket No. USCG-2019-0714: Proposed Drawbridge Operation Regulation; New River, Fort Lauderdale, FL

Dear Mr. Dragon,

Having been a Virgin Train supporter from the pre-construction days, it has come to my attention that the above stated Coast Guard Proposal Docket No. USCG-2019-0714 could potentially compromise both land commerce and the safety of South Floridians.   Logically thinking, the Coast Guards proposed fixed 120-minute time block for bridges in the up position along the New River could compromise the free flow of goods and people. But even more concerning is due to the lack of flexibility of the proposed 120- minute time block, trains could be forced to block highway crossing for long periods of time potentially preventing first responders, fire, and police from reaching victims and transporting them to safety.  Unnecessary to mention would be the public's frustration. 

Historically, the free flow of land commerce provided by FEC Railway has been an important part of our regional economy.  The growing influence of Virgin Trains providing a much needed mass transit system for South Floridas work force and tourism has already made a positive impact on the economy, will continue to do so, and will eventually have a positive impact on the entire state.  This has been accomplished in part by various stakeholders taking into consideration and accommodating economic, public, private, environmental, and political agendas.  USCG-2019-0714 could compromise this.

I am not an expert, but do believe in the positive impact Virgin Trains will continue to make on our region and state and would not want it compromised unnecessarily. I also highly respect and value the positive economic impact marine traffic has in bringing countless people from all over the world to this highly desirable boater mecca. It seems reasonable to respectfully ask the Coast Guard to reconsider the current proposal to perhaps a more balanced proposal in which the needs of both land and marine transportation are accommodated, thus protecting the economy and safety of our region.  For example; a predictable designated fixed period for bridges to be open accommodating marine transportation while allowing flexibility when needed over several hours to accommodate the somewhat less predictable regular train traffic.

This is simply a request to reconsider and possibly find a solution to accommodate everyones needs to foster the continued successful development and growth of of our beautiful region.

I appreciate your time in reading my comments.

Most Respectfully,
Martha

RE: Federal Register Docket No. USCG-2019-0714: Proposed Drawbridge Operation Regulation; New River, Fort Lauderdale, FL
Dear Director Dragon:
We are writing to provide comments on the proposed test deviation for the regulation related to the Florida East Coast Railway (FEC) Railroad Drawbridge Operation on the New River, Fort Lauderdale, FL, published in the Federal Register Docket Number USCG-2019-0714.
The overarching principle of the laws and regulations governing bridges over navigable waters of the United States is to keep them open so as to avoid unreasonable obstruction of the free navigation of the waterway. Recognizing some vessels must rely on the tides to safely navigate the river. Ensuring that the bridge tender is doing his or her job, maintaining effective signage and lighting, and establishing the ability to communicate through multimedia outlets such as social media and/or reliable apps when problems arise also are all essential to avoiding any undue obstruction to the use of the waterway.
As the new owners of Bradford Marine (3051 W. State Road 84, Fort Lauderdale, on the New River), which we acquired in January 2019, we are excited to continue contributing to the vibrant marine industry in Broward County, which is important both to mariners and the local economy.  Over the decades, Broward County and its cities and towns, have built the critical infrastructure necessary to support the continued growth in the number of large recreational vessels being sold.  Bradford Marine is part of that critical infrastructure, with a full-service repair and maintenance facility focused on vessels 70-160 feet in length, providing a full range of services, including (but not limited to) a 250 ton Synchrolift to lift boats out of the water for associated bottom work; propellers and shaft repair; metal repair (with a full welding capability); fiberglass repair; engine and hydraulic repair; carpentry and painting (including the re-painting of vessels up to 160 feet in length). In addition, Bradford Marine has 11,000 linear feet of covered dockage (long term and transient), for vessels in that same size range, and as a Hurricane Hole served many vessels that sought shelter at our facility during the recent passage of Hurricane Dorian. Since it started business in 1966, Bradford Marine has ensured that owners of large vessels have been able to receive the maintenance and repair services necessary to keep their vessels operational.
Bradford Marines viability as a provider of marine services is completely dependent on unobstructed and free navigation of the South Fork of the New River. Given the FEC RR Bridge sits approximately 4 feet above the waterway when closed, it does not allow passage of vessels when it is closed. In this area, the New River is subject to tidal currents, and vessels subject to long and unpredictable periods before the RR bridge opens, is a major deterrent in a vessels decision to bring their vessel to or yard or one of

the yards west of the FEC RR bridge for marine repair.   Bradford Marine certainly understands the need for the RR bridge to close at certain times for the transit of freight (and passengers), and vessels can certainly plan around a predictable schedule (which is not inconsistent with the railroads stated objective of maintaining a schedule).  It is the railroads lack of adherence to a schedule, and therefore the unpredictable nature of when a vessel can transit up or down the South Fork of the New River, that creates the major problem for Bradford Marine and our colleagues providing similar services on the New River.
As you can see, a business like ours is heavily dependent on unobstructed access to navigate the New River. This waterway is essential to the economic health of our industry and for the safety of those who navigate on the river. We appreciate the opportunity to provide these comments and urge the Coast Guard to make every effort to make sure that there is no unreasonable obstruction of the free navigation of the New River in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida.
I am very happy to discuss Bradford Marines concerns in person if that would be helpful.

To whom it may concern,

The 2010 Coast Guard Re-Authorization Act  mandated the USCG to come up with an Alternate Safety Compliance Plan for the existing fishing fleet. All boats over 50 feet in length, built before July 1, 2012 that are 25 year or older, the majority of existing fishing vessels, were to be required to be in compliance with these new regulations by January 1st 2020, which is now just a couple of months away. The new regulations were required to be mandatory not voluntary and they were required to be in place by 2017, giving the existing vessels 3 years to come into compliance. (see attachment 1)

As they have done on the West Coast, it is my understanding that the new regulations were intended to bring the existing vessels into an alternate inspection  program similar to the load line regulations. (see attachment 2)

I attended a meeting in Gloucester, in the fall of 2016, regarding the Alternate Safety Compliance Program were Jack Kemerer spoke. I voiced my support for the need for regulatory oversight of the existing fishing fleet, specifically with the maintenance, watertight integrity and stability. I also voice my concerns regarding the cost of the program to the smaller fishing operations, and suggested that a fund be set up to help with bringing the vessels into compliance. Shortly after this meeting I received a  notice stating that the Coast Guard had suspended development Alternate Safety Compliance program. (see attachment 3)

In January of 2017 the Coast Guard issued the Voluntary Safety Initiatives and Good Marine Practices, making the Alternate Safety Compliance Program voluntary instead of mandatory as required by CGAA Section 604(e)(1). We at Farrell and Norton Naval Architects are complying with this document, putting a five year expiration date on all of our stability booklets. Further, we believe based on our many years of experience that all fishing vessels should have their stability check every five years. (see attachment 4)

New fishing vessel construction is covered in US Code 4503-2019.  US Code 4503-2019 also clearly outlines the required maintenance schedule, and requires a stability review every five years, it seems to me that between US Code 4503-2019 and the Voluntary Safety Initiatives it would be easy for the Coast Guard to put together a  mandatory Alternate Safety Compliance Program, as required by CGAA 604(e)(1). (see attachment 5)

Thank you,

Commercial vessels had the option for an immersion suit, instead of a life jacket. As many serious Cruisers also have immersion suits aboard, would it be possible to include Impressions suits as an option for recreational boaters as well.

In addition in rough weather most serious Cruisers will have Jack lines, harnesses and safety tethers to keep them aboard. I consider that Superior to a life jacket in keeping oneself and crew aboard at all times, in rough weather. Perhaps it would be good to include a paragraph about Jack lines and tethers as well. Of course it adds complexity with requirements of suitable hardpoints and proper rigging of the jacklines and tethers. In a rough weather Crossing of a bar I would definitely be wearing a tether and harness to keep me firmly attached to the vessel. ",,,,,,,

There is currently no issues with recreational or commercial vessels experiencing accidents while transiting these areas due to unsafe weather conditions. I am not convinced that leaving the decision to close or restrict these areas to the local Coast Guard unit, Sector or Small Boat Station's, is in the publics best interest. Closing or restricting an entrance bar based on a vessels length, simply does not make sense. For example, saying that a 26' vessel is more seaworthy than a 16' vessel based solely on length is inaccurate. This does not take all factors into consideration such as the competency of the vessel operator, or vessel construction features such as self bailing decks, subdivision, reserve buoyancy, and level flotation. Using a one size fits all approach doesn't work for this situation.
Leave what is in place now alone. Having the Captain of the Port close the entrances when there is 20' plus surf is appropriate. However, leaving the decision up to the local Coast Guard units to start restricting the bar every time the tide ebbs and they think it is dangerous for a smaller vessel to cross, is not the right approach and is not supported by statistics.

My comment on the proposed regulation is that given our southern location we seldom are impacted by the 
conditions that exist in the areas of Oregon that currently are using this system. We hear do not have the tragic losses in the numbers that are happening to those in the north. The second issue is with the Impact Statement that indicates no impact on small business in the area. We have over 100 members in our Org. that are all small businesses
and each and every one will be adversely affected. Morro Bay is a small town and the impact on this many businesses and unemployment will be much more of an impact on a larger area. We are very disappointed that you did not contact anyone here before coming up with your decision that there were no impacts. Please recognize the commercial  
fishermen and the many things that do impact us. Have the courtesy to at least ask us 
rather than mislead those that are not aware of our hardships. This has the potential
to cause more than 200 people to be unemployed every day it is enforced.

I am one of them and I am shocked that this is being presented as ""necessary"" because I feel that this will do nothing for me and my clients safety except significantly reduce my income, waste my clients time and money, and make my decisions to prepare for a trip even more difficult to plan for. As a licensed captain working out of Humboldt Bay that takes people fishing almost daily from may thru sept and many days weekly into nov also, I already have the burden of bringing people into town for their fishing trip based on very vague marine forecasts coming out of the Eureka NWS office and often err on the side of caution and cancel their trip before they put the miles on their car and have to pay for hotel rooms. I cannot have people come to town from hours or states away, get hotels, buy fishing licenses, then not go because of a bar condition that I have traversed safely countless times is now restricted due to the calculation of a couple peak waves that don't meet the requirements of a new law for a certain size vessel. Safety is my number one goal everyday I go out on the ocean with people or alone, if I'm not comfortable with current conditions or forecast it's no go. All of us that transit the Humboldt Bay bar talk before and after trips, during our transit, and watch out for one another; noting which areas are better then others or if we turned around and if there is even a safety issue at all. Safety is always our number one concern and we take it as top priority and treat it as a community issue. We all take swell height, tide state, swell period, swell direction, prevailing current, wind direction and intensity, characteristics of our vessels, and latest bottom soundings into consideration as we prepare for all bar crossings. A calculation basing transit of a RNA ultimately on boat size alone without master or captain competency is complete over regulation for a situation.

This proposed law is portrayed as a regulation to close the bars at 20ft, which is already law and I feel that is reasonable due to motor life boat limitations and is the only detail mentioned in this proposal that seems appropriate. I also commercial fish throughout the year from Crescent City and Ft Bragg on my other small commercial boats between charter work and feel that if there are unsafe conditions the captains are already making the decision to not go in those ports also. I cannot recall any casualties in recent years that would've resulted in no loss with this regulation in place. The only incident I recall was a few years back a vessel broke down that was fishing the ocean side of the south jetty and got washed onto the rocks, bar restrictions would not have prevented that incident. I don't understand why Crescent City is listed, it is known to have a nice port entry even in rough weather, there are currently no motor life boat assets stationed there except the small cutter Dorado and an outboard powered RIB, I thought RNAs were implemented by crews on MLBs on the water? 

I absolutely support and appreciated the USCG and what they do for our security and community safety but feel this regulation would be very burdensome for the small businesses working out of all the proposed ports with little to nothing gained in terms of safety. People know their limitations and don't need the decisions to be made for them before they have the choice to do so themselves. This appears to be an attempt to secure more funding for USCG small boat operations on the backs of the small businesses in small coastal ports that are trying to scrap out a living, and to present it as no impact to small business is just wrong. More public outreach and education by the USCG with the less experienced mariners should be the first approach to bar crossing safety not a blanket rule that will change the way many have made a living and safely navigated these areas for years. Penalties of $25,000 is a deterrent for transit of a RNA but if staying on the ocean in awful conditions until after dark while there is a bar restriction until a tide change occurs or wave heights drop is less safe and seems counterproductive rather then letting a vessel transit in conditions it has before if the master feels like its safe to do so. 

I respectfully request that you let the captains of their vessels make the determination if conditions are unsafe and not implement this new RNA for Northern CA. If this regulation is going to be implemented, I feel that USCG licensed captains and UPVs should have an exemption for RNA transit because they have already been judged being competent to be licensed by the USCG and will be making the best decisions for their situation.

Comments on proposed anchorages in Delaware Bay and Atlantic Ocean


To Whom it May Concern:

I am a Delaware state licensed ship pilot working on the waters of the Delaware Coast, Delaware Bay and Delaware River.  I am also a past chairman of the Mariners Advisory Committee (MAC), the Harbor Safety Committee for the ports of the Delaware River Valley.

During my tenure as MAC chairman from 2009 through 2013 and continuing today, the Mariners Advisory Committee and the port community has supported the safe development of offshore wind energy off the Delaware Coast.  Knowing that port would lose access to important anchorage grounds between the sea-lanes, as evidenced by my supporting document on this current docket, dated August 2, 2011 and Captain Broadley's letter of July 18, 2011, the MAC proposed establishing the two offshore anchorage areas advertised in this USCG Docket.  Please note that this proposal was part of the public record for the Coast Guard's groundbreaking Atlantic Coast Port Access Route Study of 2011 (Docket Number USCG-2011-00351).  Therefor, it should come as no surprise to BOEM or wind energy developers that the port has great need of these proposed anchorages and where they should be located.  These anchorages should be established free of any transmission cables leading from the Wind Energy Areas (WEAs) to shore based facilities as well as any other related structures.  

Regarding the proposed anchorage in Delaware Bay, ships have been using that geographical area to anchor since the establishment of shipping on the Delaware and remain crucial to the operation of the Port.  It does not impede ferry traffic between New Jersey and Delaware and, by Delaware statute, may not be used to transfer bulk or liquid cargo.  The establishment of the formal, delineated anchorage where the traditional anchorage is will enhance the safety of navigation in the area as it serves to inform mariners of the dedicated use of the area and separates underway traffic from anchored vessels.

In summary, I urge the United States Coast Guard to establish the three proposed anchorages that are so crucial to safe navigation and the viability of the Delaware River port system

Respectfully submitted,

Captain Stephen A. Roberts, Pilot
Pilots' Association for the Bay and River Delaware

Dear Admiral Smith,

I am writing to express our concerns for the proposed changes to anchorage grounds in the Delaware Bay and Atlantic Ocean off of the Delaware coast. 

The Marine Education, Research & Rehabilitation Institute, Inc. (MERR) is Delaware's marine mammal and sea turtle stranding response organization. Permitted under NOAA and USFWS, MERR collects data on both the presence of species along the Delaware coast, and on stranding events and causes.  The coastal waters off of Delaware, including the Delaware Bay and inland bays provide habitat for 32 species of marine mammals and sea turtles, some of which are endangered species, and all of which are protected under the Marine Mammal Protection Act and/or the Endangered Species Act.  We see no mention of impacts to protected species in the RFP.

The proposal to move the anchorage areas closer to shore poses grave threats to the many species that forage in these same areas.  Of particular concern is anchorage B, located just 2.5 miles north of Cape Henlopen and the mouth of the Delaware Bay.  This area provides essential habitat for many different species, and is utilized by sea turtles, dolphins and large whales as an established area to forage for food and to raise their young.  Humpback whales feed with dolphins in near shore waters where prey is plentiful.  The area surrounding the mouth of the Delaware Bay hosts an abundance of bottlenose dolphins during the summer months, and seals during the winter months.  The bottlenose dolphins in this area are the largest northern population of this species, and reside in the area for 9 months out of the year.  The area surrounding the Point is established as having significant numbers of this species, and sighting data supports that individual animals return to this same area year after year.  Seals have established a communal haul out area around the inner break wall, and require an extended expanse of feeding area surrounding that location.  Increases in shipping traffic in this same area would pose an elevated risk of ship strike for these marine species.  Vessel induced impacts remain a significant source of fatality for large whales, and our data supports that ship strike is the cause of death for over 50% of sea turtle mortalities in Delaware waters.  The additional underwater noise generated by the ship's engines will also interfere with mother and calf communication.  Mother/calf pairs of large whales, including humpback whales and the severely endangered North Atlantic right whale frequent the near shore waters to feed, and mothers will utilize this area to teach their young how to forage on their own.   North Atlantic right whales are known to exhibit matrilineal fidelity to feeding areas, taking their offspring to the same area they were taught to feed by their own mothers.  The Delaware Bay is one of these locations.  

In addition, large whale species utilize areas off of the Delaware Coast as part of their ancient migratory pathway as they make their way from their northern feeding grounds to their southern birthing grounds.  We consider the proposed relocation of the anchorage areas to be a threat to the established patterns of these endangered species, and would therefore constitute harassment and displacement under the MMPA.  

We also have concerns about the introduction of invasive species from international ships anchoring in such close proximity to the mouth of the Delaware Bay.  Many of these ships arrive from international waters, bringing with them potentially invasive species that would be introduced into this sensitive ecosystem during bilge emptying operations.  Of equal concern is the increased risk for oil leaks and spills into this currently healthy and abundant ecosystem.

We request that the USCG give serious consideration to the environmental impacts that would occur were the anchorage areas relocated to the new locations that have been proposed.   We support the status quo option as being the most sound and least impactful option for the marine environment, particularly in consideration of the fact that the offshore wind farm proposals are very controversial due to their adverse impact on the marine environment and wildlife, and may not be developed as planned.

We are happy to provide additional information, including supportive data, so please do not hesitate to contact us. I hope you can understand our grave concerns for this decision. It seems is to have little to do with the best interests of the enviroment and the marine life that visit and exists in these waters as well as the fragile eco system that is already severely stressed.

I just came across this proposal through one of the groups that I follow.  I do not feel that we need to be moving or adding anchorage sites that are so close to our coast.  From an environmental and ecological stand point we do not need more larger ships waiting close to our coast to enter the Bay.  We have a large number of both fish and mammals that traverse our coastlines and we need to give them a wider berth.  Especially, Anchorage B which would be near the mouth of the Bay.  Anchorage D at six miles out of the Indian River Inlet is also pushing the distance as well and I would like to see the anchorage closer to ten miles out.

I am writing to express our concerns for the proposed changes to anchorage grounds in the Delaware Bay and Atlantic Ocean off of the Delaware coast.
 
I am a volunteer for The Marine Education, Research & Rehabilitation Institute, Inc. (MERR) Which is Delaware's marine mammal and sea turtle stranding response organization. I am also a resident that resides on the Delaware Bay. Just a reminder: Permitted under NOAA and USFWS, MERR collects data on both the presence of species along the Delaware coast, and on stranding events and causes.  The coastal waters off of Delaware, including the Delaware Bay and inland bays provide habitat for 32 species of marine mammals and sea turtles, some of which are endangered species, and all of which are protected under the Marine Mammal Protection Act and/or the Endangered Species Act.  We see no mention of impacts to protected species in the RFP.
 
The proposal to move the anchorage areas closer to shore poses grave threats to the many species that forage in these same areas.  Of particular concern is anchorage B, located just 2.5 miles north of Cape Henlopen and the mouth of the Delaware Bay.  This area provides essential habitat for many different species, and is utilized by sea turtles, dolphins and large whales as an established area to forage for food and to raise their young.  Humpback whales feed with dolphins in near shore waters where prey is plentiful.  The area surrounding the mouth of the Delaware Bay hosts an abundance of bottlenose dolphins during the summer months, and seals during the winter months.  The bottlenose dolphins in this area are the largest northern population of this species, and reside in the area for 9 months out of the year.  The area surrounding the Point is established as having significant numbers of this species, and sighting data supports that individual animals return to this same area year after year.  Seals have established a communal haul out area around the inner break wall, and require an extended expanse of feeding area surrounding that location.  Increases in shipping traffic in this same area would pose an elevated risk of ship strike for these marine species.  Vessel induced impacts remain a significant source of fatality for large whales, and our data supports that ship strike is the cause of death for over 50% of sea turtle mortalities in Delaware waters.  The additional underwater noise generated by the ship's engines will also interfere with mother and calf communication.  Mother/calf pairs of large whales, including humpback whales and the severely endangered North Atlantic right whale frequent the near shore waters to feed, and mothers will utilize this area to teach their young how to forage on their own.   North Atlantic right whales are known to exhibit matrilineal fidelity to feeding areas, taking their offspring to the same area they were taught to feed by their own mothers.  The Delaware Bay is one of these locations.  
 
In addition, large whale species utilize areas off of the Delaware Coast as part of their ancient migratory pathway as they make their way from their northern feeding grounds to their southern birthing grounds.  We consider the proposed relocation of the anchorage areas to be a threat to the established patterns of these endangered species, and would therefore constitute harassment and displacement under the MMPA.  
 
We also have concerns about the introduction of invasive species from international ships anchoring in such close proximity to the mouth of the Delaware Bay.  Many of these ships arrive from international waters, bringing with them potentially invasive species that would be introduced into this sensitive ecosystem during bilge emptying operations.  Of equal concern is the increased risk for oil leaks and spills into this currently healthy and abundant ecosystem.
 
We request that the USCG give serious consideration to the environmental impacts that would occur were the anchorage areas relocated to the new locations that have been proposed.   We support the status quo option as being the most sound and least impactful option for the marine environment, particularly in consideration of the fact that the offshore wind farm proposals are very controversial due to their adverse impact on the marine environment and wildlife, and may not be developed as planned.

We are hopeful that you will give our comments and concerns serious consideration. As educators and environmentalists, we cannot in good conscience see any benefits to the communities and ocean environment that surround the Delaware seashore and bays.

Christine and Paul Dunford",,,,,,,

RE: USCG-2019 -0822 

Dear Admiral Smith,

I am deeply concerned about the changes to anchorage in the Delaware Bay and surrounding area. If implemented, these actions would have devastating environmental consequences in a location that supports great biodiversity.

Some of several impacts would include disruption of marine mammal migration, increased risk of polluting and disrupting  productive habitat and potential introduction of invasive species. Of special concern is proposed anchorage B -- an especially sensitive area.

I hope that you might reconsider this proposal or, at least, consider comprehensive environmental impact studies. 

Sincerely,

Joelle Morris

We are very active boaters in the Milwaukee Area. We too have been following the unprofessionalism of Alderman Bob Bauman and his personal quest to limit bridge operations in Milwaukee. His disapproval of the boating community is no reason to proceed on a blind call to make changes. We feel the limits suggested by Mr. Bauman are not practical for the area boaters and hinder our well earned enjoyment of the city. We would be for a compromise on the bridge openings. Mr. Bob Bauman has taken the approach that this is his way or the highway.

Lets work together as you did in Miami to appease both parties easing traffic flows and still permitting vessels to pass.. That is what my government should be doing. We are also members of McBoat. The McKinley Marina Boat Owners Association. They represent over 600 boats in the Milwaukee basin.
Please consider a compromise. Thank you for your efforts and to here our concerns. If you wish to contact us for further comment. we welcome your call.

My wife Lynn & I have been boaters on Lake Michigan for nearly 50 years. We are members of the Milwaukee Harbor Yacht Club (past Commodore) as well as South Shore Yacht Club. We keep our 36' power cruiser moored at the McKinley Marina in Milwaukee and are members and Board Member (Lynn) of the McKinley Boat Owners Association, McBoat. I am also a USCG Licensed 50 ton Captain. (currently not working) I realize that my comments alone don't hold much weight, but I would like to make my thoughts known.

I am Not related to Alderman Bauman. The Alderman, with his actions, is looking to essentially shut down recreational boating on the Milwaukee River. 

There are several issues I would like to comment on. (See the Authority Section of the proposed rule)
> I don't see an issue with adding 30 minutes to the afternoon drive time. Traffic has gotten busier. The midnight to 7 am, 2 hour restriction seems a bit early. I would think a 1 am to 7 am would be more palatable especially on the weekends where recreational boaters may tend to stay out later. I believe this should be consistent with all Milwaukee rivers as noted in other sections of the proposed rules.

> As indicated in the proposed rules, I believe there are a number of commercial vessels under 50 ton that regularly use the river. I would like to see this rule eliminated and allow all commercial vessels full use of the river. To allow some commercial vessels and restrict others is a restraint of trade.

> As indicated in the proposed rules regarding ""winter hours"". There are still many boats in the water well beyond November 2nd, both in the marinas and along the river. Nov 2nd seems a bit too restrictive. November 15th may be a better date. Many boats need to get out of the river to be pulled out for storage, or up the Kinnickinnic River to one of the marinas.

Regarding the 2 Hour advance notice:

> With having to adhere to a 2 hour notice for bridge openings, this is going to pretty much shut down recreational boats from transiting north on the Milwaukee River to enjoy the restaurants and cultural activities along the river way. The issue with a 2-hour notice for transiting, has to do with dockage availability. If I put in my 2-hour request for Bridge openings and get to where I want to be, if there is nowhere to dock, now I'm stuck, having to wait numerous hours to make my bridge opening time heading back. In the meantime, I'm floating in the middle of the river, likely impeding other traffic and if it's a windy day, more complications arise. You can see that with these limitations most would not take the chance of going north of the St. Paul Bridge. (mile 1.21) The limitations he wants to put will definitely reduce business to those restaurants and entertainment sites above mile 1.21.  This essentially cuts off the north section of the Milwaukee River from being used by recreational boats needing an opening. 

The unfortunate thing is that it appears that Alderman Bauman did not reach out to the boating community to seek advise &/or compromise. The noise complaints are few and far between. Numerous people at a public hearing noted that the river traffic was an intriguing part of living along the river. In fact, I believe there may have been only one complainant. (As I do not live in the City of Milwaukee, I was not in attendance and watched a video replay of the meeting) My feeling is that this has more to do with City finances than noise complaints. I also believe the Alderman has a negative view of recreational boaters as he made a comment that they are just the rich people from the suburbs cruising up the river with their cocktails.

I certainly hope that some compromise can be negotiated with the proposed rules. Thank you for taking the time to read my thoughts.

Its really important to know whats going on or be careful of your surrounding and if you see anything suspicious make sure to report it.

I support this regulation because of recent terrorist attacks on major sporting events and large crowd attendance. High attendance rates can result in specific locations to cause an act of terror among large crowds. For example, the Boston marathon had a high attendance rate and caused around 264 casualties. These large crowds are vulnerable to mass homicides. According to NBC NEWS, Super Bowl 53 had a team of counterterrorism and law enforcement officials prepare for a threat assembly in which they concluded no threat. However, the biggest football game of the year made it a target for terrorist groups. There are no credible terrorist threats to this years game. But its high profile could make it a desirable target. Many sports venues sparked a wake up call after the deadly 9/11 attacks according to athleticbuilding.com. They stated The events of 9/11 proved a wakeup call across the country, prompting individual sports venues to take a closer look at their security policies and driving league- and organization-wide reforms. This wake up call brought more security options like cameras to make sure everything was safe.

As a frequent watcher of the Super Bowl I very much support this Security Zone. The Super Bowl is the most watched and anticipated sporting event in the country and that makes it a target for people with ill intentions. The Super Bowl being in Miami so close to the Ocean makes it especially susceptible to attack then it would be if it were in any other stadium.

This year, a temporary flight restriction was put in place in Atlanta, GA for SuperBowl 2019 prohibiting the flight of drones on the date of the event and the three days prior. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) made the airspace around the Mercedes Benz stadium a ""No Drone Zone"". I believe that any and all safety measures should be put in place for any large event taking place in the United States. The SuperBowl is one of the highest trafficked events as it is the end all be all, for the American football season. South Florida's Sun Sentinel shares that an estimated 65,000 visitors will attend the 2020 game, and another 200,000 will be around the area for ""side gatherings"". This is a substantial amount of people and an easy target for any types of terroristic threats. As a visitor to several public events including concerts and sporting events, I am in agreement with putting safety measures such as this temporary security zone in place.

The Coast Guard and COTP Miami have demonstrated a well thought strategic plan to keep the surrounding communities safe with the large influx of attendees for the Super Bowl. The partnership between the two agencies is striving to achieve a level of security to protect navigable waterways around the city because of the security threat for visitors. The proposed rule addresses how it does not have any significant effect on the small entities in the area as it will only be enforced for a period of eight days. The rule also does not affect traffic through these areas. Mariners are only allowed to travel through instead of anchoring, except for emergencies, thus not impeding traffic patterns. 

I think this is an effective rule because it clearly addresses the authority of the Coast Guard to enforce it while also providing the details of the location and time of the rule. Because it is already being discussed, the public will have extensive notice to prepare any traffic delays or interference with their daily schedules. This proposed rule establishes accountability with the Coast Guard because it has allowed the public to address their concerns and ask questions about the details of the rule.

As a member of the public, I think stopping boating and human traffic on this stretch of the river would be beneficial to the public and anyone traveling on or around the river at this time.  Fireworks are large, loud, and distracting displays that can easily draw an individual's attention away from the task at hand.  Distracted boaters and members of the public can cause harm to themselves, others, and the surrounding landscape especially during late hours of the night, in dark and unlit areas, and while operating heavy machinery such as marine vehicles.  Halting travel on the stretch would allow boaters and individuals to observe the fireworks from a safe distance and proceed with business after the displays have stopped.  ",,,,,,,

However, a question that I have is if there is any chance that this operation may be longer than the allotted time? On the other hand, is there any chance that this operation would be shorted than the allotted time? It is imperative to have the use of the safety zone authorized by the Captain of the Port Southeast Alaska, or another official, in order to maintain the safety of that area. ",,,,,,,

A detractor to my argument may state, that it is unnecessary to be in the Tongass Narrows to begin with. To that, I would say that once this area has been selected already, and we must make this zone as safe as possible.",,,,,,,

In the environment section of the proposal, their is a lot of emphasis on the ""human environment"" and the ""economics environment"", both of which will be relatively unaffected by the new regulation. However, I feel that they have not fully considered the impact that the explosives could have on the ecosystem in the area. This body of water alone is a very complex environment where explosives could interrupt a number of organisms. Also the effect on the quality of the water and the potential to effect nearby shorelines should be considered before doing anything. If these different things can be confirmed and there is no major effect on the environment or ecosystem then the regulation should be put in place.",,,,,,,

Also according to their background information on regulation it says that it would not be following the new regulation laws if they did not create a safe zone.

I am not particularly educated on the area however, I am familiar with the process of dredging and its destructive nature for a hopeful benefit to our infrastructure or some economic.  Upon doing some research of the proposed plan I found there were 8 species of marine mammals in the area that were expected to experience disturbances from this.

In facing the coronavirus crisis he is most concerned about protecting his numbers.

So far this hasn't worked too well. After Trump and Mulvaney hyped the stock market, it fell like a rock. Similarly Trump predicted that the number of coronavirus cases in the US would not exceed 15:

""... you have 15 people, and the 15 within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero, that's a pretty good job we've done."" - President Tiny Hands, Feb 26 2020

Well now there are over 300 cases, but Trump is still doing his best to cook the books. He's pushing for passengers to remain on the Grand Princess cruise ship - because onshore cases don't really count:

""experts... would like to have the people come off. I'd rather have the people stay but I'll go with them. I would rather because I like the numbers being where they are. I don't need to have the numbers double because of one ship that wasn't our fault."" - President Tiny Hands

Constant renewal of infrastructure is important to operating safely across rail networks. 

The railroad bridge over the Missouri River between Bismarck and Mandan, N.D. is private transportation infrastructure that's critical to the state's economy. More than 100 years old, the bridge is approaching the time when it won't be able to safely carry train loads of North Dakota's grain, coal, crude oil, and other industrial products.

As someone who is concerned about public safety and the economy, I urge you to approve the permit for BNSF Railway to build a new railroad bridge over the Missouri River in Bismarck and Mandan, North Dakota. 

The bridge is more than 100 years old and BNSF  needs to build a new one to continue safely hauling North Dakota's grain and other commodities. 

Keeping the existing bridge in place could create flooding issues, increase costs significantly, and add delays to construction. 

The best course is simple: build a new bridge and remove the old one. Keeping the existing bridge in place is problematic. Building a new one next to it could create flooding impacts for private property, and impact Bismarck's water reservoir and a dedicated nature preserve. BNSF's project costs would increase $10 - $75 million and take one to four years longer to construct if forced to keep the old bridge in place.

Action is needed now. For two years, BNSF has been in the permit process. No credible plan has emerged for funding or ownership of the current bridge. BNSF needs to build its planned bridge project without further delay so they can help keep ND's economy on track.

I urge you to approve the permit so that a new bridge can be built soon and the railroad can safely ship the goods upon which our economy relies.",,,,,,,

My name is Joel Land and I am a Bismarckian born and raised. After graduating HS, I went to college in Tennessee in 2007, got married in 2013 and have lived in Chattanooga, TN until last year. I moved my southern wife and our young family back to Bismarck because we believe it is the best place for us to raise our family.

Chattanooga is not dissimilar to Bismarck. It is a city built around a river. It has a growing and thriving downtown. There is a large population of people living there who love outdoor recreation. This city also has a number of bridges that cross the TN river near downtown.

I have attached a picture of my family on the Walnut Street Pedestrian Bridge in Chattanooga, TN from 2018. My parents (Tom & Carol Land) came to visit from Bismarck, ND and we were proud to take them to this gorgeous city attraction. What if we could do the same in our city? Hundreds and thousands of people walk across this bridge every day. It is a hub for locals and tourists alike. *Read more here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walnut_Street_Bridge_(Chattanooga)

Imagine the positive impact on our community and the way it would ""bridge"" the gap between Bismarck/Mandan. I have seen many positive changes in Bismarck since I moved back, and I strongly desire to see this landmark preserved and put to good use.

Bismarck has amazing things to offer. We can't afford to tear them down.

Thank you for reading,
Sincerely,
Joel Land",,,,,,,

The opportunity at hand to preserve a significant bridge and turn it into a community amenity is something that people look for when moving to a new city.

With the 1864 land grant, the Northern Pacific Railway took one of the largest transfers of public land (over 50 million acres) to a private corporation in the history of democratic government. The Northern Pacific Railway has played a key role in westward expansion of the United States in the 19th and 20th Centuries. This includes large-scale infrastructure projects and countless scores of employees and homesteaders. Since the market crash of 1873, the Northern Pacific has capitalized on the government's largess to a grand degree, even spinning off entire new industrial corporations taking advantage of the forest lands of the Pacific Northwest. The legacy of the Land Grant has had indelible impacts on large swaths of the NW United States.

The arrangement has worked out very strongly in the railroad's (and Warren Buffett's) favor of late. With record quarterly profits recently, the railroad is reaping billions and billions of dollars in profit annually from the arrangement established with the government back in 1864, now 156 years ago.

A key feature in the development of the railroad was the arrival of the first trains in Bismarck, North Dakota, in 1873, followed 3 months later by a global financial collapse spawned by the bankruptcy of the Northern Pacific Railroad. For nearly 10 years, westward progress was halted at Bismarck, North Dakota, with the Mighty Missouri River blocking the way. During those 10 years, the US Army remained at this site, with George Armstrong Custer even working in the Railroad's employ performing survey work during this time.

Incredibly, the river presented such a daunting challenge that a tunnel underneath the river was considered more likely for nearly a year prior to settling on the Bismarck-Mandan Rail Bridge as the solution to the problem. This allowed Bismarck to grow large enough to be designated as the Territorial Capital and later to become the state capital. Pressure toward westward expansion was so strong that the first trains across the river were carried by barge and even, in a first-ever action in world history, a never-before-seen act of bravery and hardiness, in 1879 the first trains crossed the Missouri River under their own power on tracks laid directly upon the ice! Crossing the Missouri River by rail remains a monumental accomplishment to this day.

The bridge was built at a very high-profile site in Northern Plains history, the exact site where bison crossed the river on their annual migrations, where Native American tribes had gathered for centuries to hunt the bison, and a major cultural crossroads on the plains. The site was known as ""The Crossing"", where Native Americans had retreated to cross the Missouri River ahead of General Sibley 20 years earlier after being chased out of Minnesota. Amazingly, the bridge has handsomely withstood the test of time and its hand-carved stone pillars remain a sturdy testament to this history today.

The bridge at this location represents far more than simply one of the most impressive engineering feats of the American Frontier, engineered by George Shattuck Morrison. Construction used methods similar to those used to construct the Brooklyn Bridge in New York, completed the same year as the Brooklyn Bridge. It tells the story of the Northern Pacific Railway better than any other surviving feature of the Road. It is a National Treasure. The parties deciding the fate of this bridge must introduce more of this consideration into the rhetoric surrounding the new construction project. There is large opportunity here for BNSF, the Coast Guard, North Dakota leadership, and local leadership to take positive action in preserving their own and our Nation's history by honoring and preserving the existing Historic Bridge. I am grateful for this opportunity to express my feelings in this instance, as the bridge is THE ICON of the Northern Plains and an anchoring cultural touchpoint in the local community and the state of North Dakota and deserves respect as such.",,,,,,"https://downloads.regulations.gov/USCG-2019-0882-0015/attachment_4.jpg,https://downloads.regulations.gov/USCG-2019-0882-0015/attachment_4.pdf,https://downloads.regulations.gov/USCG-2019-0882-0015/attachment_2.jpg,https://downloads.regulations.gov/USCG-2019-0882-0015/attachment_1.jpg",

The Historic Railway Bridge Across the Missouri River is an integral piece of North Dakota's heritage.  In a young state, without a large population density, the urgency of keeping what we have is vital.

The state strives to keep its population health and a good place to raise families, the bridge can be a part of that system.

I am writing in support of the preservation of the BNSF Railway Bridge. 

Built by the Northern Pacific Railroad Company from 1880-1883, the rail bridge represents the unprecedented industrial expansion of its era. As the first bridge to span the upper Missouri River, it contributed significantly to the growth of the rail roads, now known to be one of the greatest infrastructure projects in American history. 

Built in the same decade has New York City's Brooklyn Bridge, it is deserving of similar preservation and treatment for future generations to marvel at and enjoy.

The bridge was a gateway staple in the Railroads expansion westward and would not have been possible without the bridge over the MO River. Aside from Indigenous people in the region beforehand, the cities of Bismarck and Mandan would not have been. Recognized as a site of conscience due to its impacts in white settlement and Native American communities, the bridge has become more than a piece of regional history but US history.

Being built in 1883, the bridge predates the Brooklyn Bridge in NYC/Brooklyn, making it one of the oldest historical figures in the Midwest. As the bridge connects Bismarck-Mandan through rail line; converting the bridge has a pedestrian trail that has been proven feasible by study, as well as providing both communities a better way of life. Trails more specifically rail to trails have been proven to increase happiness and healthiness within local communities.

The residents of both Bismark-Mandan are pleading with you, PLEASE do the right thing and save the bridge.

Can iron be organic? It has become so , a connection to the pre industrial upper Missouri people and the world they knew.

It is a remnant of the Port of Bismarck . Its stone piers have  iron rings on the downriver sides  that were used to tie off Mountain Trade steam boats.

Joseph Henry Taylor was an chronicler of the river men and women of all races.  I recall one of his bridge stories from his book, Frontier Tales and  Kaleidoscopic Lives . During the dedication of the bridge this distinguished writer was an honored guest paired with Lady Red Blanket who told the story of the Burn Boat. She was a girl when  Montana gold miners enroute to St Louis shot and killed an elder who warned them to take another channel or be run aground in the shallows. Red Blanket's people had fled the White Stone Massacre , had come to the river's edge bereft of all but the clothes on their back just up river from the bridge where upon she , a distinguished guest was paired with our region's most distinguished chronicler.

This from a son of a Prohibition Era Sheriff : Mandan's local booze mob , the Wetstein's won a gun battle on the west end of the bridge. Chicago's Al Capone ,challenged and lost the Wetstein Boys. The Wetstein ploy was to feign control of the west end of the Memorial Bridge . It worked. The Chicago Boys drove across the railroad bridge into a trap. I practiced law with the son of the Wetstein's trigger man . He and his companions climbed up into  the girders and shot down into the heavy metal cars full of Italians and their Ydish allies. they dump the shot up Chicago boys's cars bodies and all  into the river.

I asked the sheriff what happened . He said , "" Nothing. ""I asked him why. He said , "" It was a problem solved.""

Clearly there is a path forward that would allow for the preservation of this bridge, which is a National Treasure, with a new bridge alongside. It seems simply to be a matter of engineering. Has this engineering been performed? The railroad has skilled, experienced resources to accomplish this. The bridge is as much a part of the railroad's heritage and history as it is North Dakota's, the Northern Plains', and the United States' and Northern Europe's, they stand to earn great public good will by preserving the bridge and promoting it as a very well-preserved example of the tremendous efforts made by our ancestors to tame the Missouri River and settle the Northwest.

Being on the edge of Bismarck as a youth, this played an important role in my understanding of the history of the capital city of Bismarck and spurred my appreciation of history in general, local history in particular, and the value of the tangible remnants of the past, as I'm sure it likewise has spurred others.  My father, also born and raised in Bismarck, used this icon to instruct our family about the role of the railroad not only in the settlement and firm establishment of Bismarck as a central hub in the Euroamerican settlement of Bismarck and Mandan, but also the of the broader region (northern Plains).  As an engineer, my father also used the bridge to teach us in a very relatable and visual manner about engineering, physics, and engineering history. It was also through discussions of the railroad bridge construction history and stabilization that I learned about the history of the municipal waterworks of Bismarck. The two are intimately intertwined and a fascinating story that otherwise is overlooked because remnants of the historic waterworks are gone or less visible. More personally, my father's lifetime remembrances of the railroad in Bismarck, and more particularly of the bridge, led to the understanding of our more recent family history. In sum, this single structure documents and conveys in multiple ways many different levels of history of North Dakota (as well as of the United States), the cities of Bismarck and Mandan, and of local families.
The heritage value of the BNSF bridge has been accentuated since the removal of the other historic (Liberty Memorial) bridge that once spanned the Missouri River between Bismarck and Mandan. Both once served as visual reminders of different aspects of the region's history. Now, all that remains is the BNSF railway bridge.
Should the existing railroad bridge be removed or dramatically transformed, the public will be less likely to understand the key role of the railroad in Bismarck-Mandan and regional transportation, economic, military, and cultural history.  As many studies show, tangible remains of the past are key to how humans learn about the past and are able to grasp the depth of time and significance of the many historical and cultural processes that have led to who we are today.
As required for EIS studies, I hope the cultural and historical role of the BNSF Railway bridge across the Missouri River at Bismarck will be thoroughly documented and incorporated into the assessment of this significant feature of the local and broader regional heritage!",,,,,,,

The Marsh Arch (Rainbow Bridge) near Baxter Springs, KS on historic Route 66. 
Saving historic structures and buildings tend to be more of a benefit than a burden. As National Trust points out Historic structures have intrinsic value, are reminders of culture and human ingenuity, and the regret of losing history seems to outweigh the regret of keeping historical structures.  

Choose one of the other options for building a new bridge and keeping the historic BNSF Bridge.

This mistake was made with the Main Ave Bridge.  Image if that bridge were still standing and the new (current) bridge was built adjacent to it to the south.  The cities of Bismarck and Mandan, and Burleigh and Morton Counties would have been able to start a regional recreational trail system connecting the two cities and counties separated by the river.

It represents the push to enjoy freedom in a new land for scores of hardworking people fleeing oppression in their home countries.  My Great-grandfather, W.H. Mann, was an early ND railroad commissioner who shipped his dairy's products from New Salem, ND to Montana and beyond.  Another set of great-grandparents established a merchandise business in Hebron, ND and depended upon rail shipments.  When I was a child in Dickinson, ND where my father and grandfather established businesses, our evening entertainment was going to the depot to see what or who arrived or was departing.  It was a community meeting center.  

I think the rail bridge converted to walking bridge between Mandan and Bismarck could further the community spirit of the two communities. It could be a venue for free family concerts and farmers markets during the summer months.  Maybe with picnic facilities on both sides of the river.  It would be a ""fitness center""  for walking and riding bikes, too.  Most people in this area do not have the financial means to afford boats with which to enjoy the river scene.  The walking bridge would be an outdoor public asset shared by the two communities.    

Environmentally, the walking bridge would be petrol-use free.  The air, birds, plants and people around it would benefit from fewer vehicles emitting noxious effluent.  The walking bridge would definitely be a community social resource enhancing the ""livability"" quotient as well as an environmental asset.  It would also be a living memorial to those pioneer ancestors and the railroad's importance to Western North Dakota.",,,,,,,

However, this rail bridge across the Missouri River at Bismarck-Mandan is more than just a structure to transport goods across our country.   It is an integral part of the Bismarck-Mandan communities, North Dakota and indeed the entire country.   It is a part of our everyday lives.

I do not oppose construction of a new bridge across the Missouri--in fact I wholeheartedly support that effort.  However, I urge the United States Coast Guard, in the EIS process and Section 106 permitting process, to work with the railroad and all interested parties in formulating a feasible alternative that will retain the existing bridge and establish a path forward for the preservation and operation of the bridge for all manner of uses.   Yes, it will require some hard work and difficult decisions.  Yes, it may take more time than originally planned.  However, I am hopeful all involved parties will make that effort.

The historic 1883 rail bridge, owned by BNSF Railway, is an iconic landmark for the community and state. Its image is ubiquitous, appearing in everything from corporate advertising to family portraits. 

It was the first bridge to cross the upper Missouri. George Shattuck Morison designed and oversaw its construction between 1880 and 1883. The project employed advanced construction methods, including pneumatic caissons such as those used to build its contemporary, the Brooklyn Bridge. Arguably, it is the most historically significant structure on the Northern Plains. 

If BNSF is serious about getting the new permit, they should be forthcoming and provide viable alternatives that would accommodate a second track while keeping the historic bridge. 

Please have the EIS address these issues: 
	Impacts to Cultural Heritage - The proposed undertaking would adversely affect historical and cultural sites that are of national significance and that are significant to area residents, including indigenous peoples. The existing railroad bridge was built in 1883 and is eligible for the National Register of Historic Places. The structure is iconic and, because the cities of Bismarck and Mandan evolved solely because of this bridge, it embodies the history, culture, and identity of this community. How would the proposed project impact our cultural heritage?
	Impacts to Outdoor Recreation and Tourism - The proposed project is at the hub of social and economic activity in Bismarck-Mandan. Continued outdoor recreation  and tourism on the Missouri River and in surrounding parks is important to our community. How would the proposed project impact these elements of local life and the tourist economy?
	Impacts to Viewshed - The proposed project would alter current views on the Missouri River. The existing bridge is highly-visible structure, and has emerged over the past 130 years as the picture-postcard image of Bismarck-Mandan. It is admired for its aesthetic value and is used prolifically as a backdrop to family photos and in local and regional advertising. How would the proposed project impact the aesthetic qualities of the Missouri River in its viewshed?

BNSF needs a new, robust, and dependable bridge to bear the cargo of the modern era. I applaud BNSF for the essential service they provide to our communities. However, the preservation of the historic bridge and the construction of a new one need not be mutually exclusive. There are reasonable solutions that will satisfy BNSF's need for a new bridge while preserving the historic bridge. 

As a Bismarck resident, I strongly urge the US Coast Guard to act in accordance with the National Historic Preservation Act and keep the bridge.

Although I love living in the Northern Plains area, we have precious little topographical interest in Bismarck/Mandan. A number of paved multi use paths and off road singletrack trails skirt above and below the bridge, offering a fabulous way to view the sunset as it dips behind the horizon and creates a brilliant glowing backdrop behind the silhouetted rail bridge. 

Up until recently, this was my main connection to bridge. For nearly thirty years I essentially saw it as a decoration between our two cities of Bismarck and Mandan. Judging by previously submitted comments and the host of rail bridge photos, murals, and memorabilia, many others feel similarly. The bridge is an icon in our community. At the time of its construction, it was a technological marvel. It stood as a symbol of expansion, economic prosperity, and progress. However, I never considered that it wasn't a symbol of prosperity for everyone. Since the rail bridge has been such a prominent topic in our local news over the past year or two, I have learned more about its history. I now see the bridge as a visual aide to explore our nation's history and learn about the land that I call home. I see the rail bridge as an opportunity to facilitate conversations and invite people to tell the stories of their family history and how the bridge changed their lives--for the better or for the worse. 

As this project moves ahead, I think it's important to recognize that history is not only for books and Wikipedia articles. Tangible, living history--especially when left in place--has a powerful impact (especially when we consider that over 50% of the population are visual learners!) History tells exciting tales and teaches valuable lessons that we take forward into the future. Preserving history is a part of moving a healthy society forward. I urge the Coast Guard to ensure that the EIS fully explores the cultural impacts the Bismarck Mandan rail bridge. ",,,,,,,

Much has been said and written in many forums about the historical significance of the bridge and its ""association with broad patterns of railroad, commercial and military history of the United States."" 

Having worked as a historical interpreter or public historian for several different non-profits and agencies in North Dakota over the last decade, my concern is that its association with broad patterns of settlement has been understated. 

While the Republican Party controlled both Congress and the Presidency during the Civil War, it took the opportunity to enact its platform of westward expansionism and ""free soil"" through passage of the Homestead Act and creation of two transcontinental railroads--the first mechanized travel routes east and west across the United States. The second of these railroads was called the Northern Pacific (NPRR). It was supposed to spur the settlement of the region stretching west from Minnesota to the Pacific Ocean. Until about the 1960s, newspapers, advertisements, and doubtless day-to-day conversation referred to this area as its own region of the United States, ""the Northwest."" 

The Northern Pacific Railroad was such a massive infrastructure project that the bankruptcy of its creditor, the Jay Cooke Bank, in 1873 caused an international economic depression that affected both the United States and Europe. 

It took years for NPRR construction to get back underway, but when it completed its final and, arguably, most challenging segments, the Bismarck-Mandan Rail Bridge in 1882 and the Rocky Mountain segment in 1883, it was as if a switch had been flipped. 

The first two building seasons after its completion, 1883 and 1884, saw dozens of towns spring up, some of the earliest stylized buildings built (many of which are historic sites today), colleges like UND and several other civic institutions founded. Dakota Territory moved its capital from Yankton to Bismarck to be along the rail route. Theodore Roosevelt and the Marquis de Mores came to the region. Within eight years of the bridge's completion and seven years of the railroad's, five states making up ""the Northwest,"" had been admitted to the Union, namely North and South Dakota, Montana, Idaho, and Washington. 

If the Bakken oil boom had been made possible by the completion of a single infrastructure project, and the corresponding population boom had led to the founding of multiple states, that might illustrate the difference that the Northern Pacific Railroad and its bridge over the Missouri River made. Those piers are a tangible link to developments that deeply shaped America as we know it. It's my hope that a way can be found to save them. ",,,,,,,

The historic rail bridge over the Missouri River is a critical part of Bismarck and Mandan's human environment.  The bridge's iconic presence is a critical element that defines both communities.  Moreover, the bridge itself and the history it represents is intrinsic to the region's tourism and recreation economy.  

Full analysis and any corresponding mitigation needs to cover the proposal's effects as defined in 40 CFR 1508.8, specifically effects on the quality of the human environment, including changes in the human environment that the project may impact that are aesthetic, historic, cultural, economic, (or) social.  

Of concern is the impact the proposal might have to the historic rail bridge and the bridge's connection to the region's cultural heritage, aesthetics, history and economy.  The community of Bismarck, including the City, the Park District, commercial businesses, and various nonprofit organizations have invested in recreational, commercial, and historical-related improvements afforded by access to the Missouri River and its historical context.  A critical element to the historical context is the rail bridge.  Improvements along the river and near the rail bridge have included a shared use path, interpretive historical displays, a riverboat business, a boat ramp, and a riverboat event center that is under construction.  These improvements and the associated historic, cultural, and aesthetic setting of the river and rail bridge are a key part of the region's tourism and recreation economy.

I advocate for a preservation solution and, in preparing the EIS, I hope to see an exhaustive examination of several important potential impacts to this community. They are as follows:

1) Impacts to Cultural Heritage - The proposed undertaking would adversely affect historical and cultural sites that are of national significance and that are significant to area residents, including indigenous peoples. The existing railroad bridge was built in 1883 and is eligible for the National Register of Historic Places. The structure is iconic and, because the cities of Bismarck and Mandan evolved solely because of this bridge, it embodies the history, culture, and identity of this community. How and to what degree would the proposed project impact our cultural heritage? Can impacts it be avoided or minimized? How?

2) Impacts to Outdoor Recreation and Tourism - The proposed project is at the hub of social and economic activity in Bismarck-Mandan. Continued outdoor recreation  and tourism on the Missouri River and in surrounding parks is important to our community. How and to what degree would the proposed project impact these elements of local life and the tourist economy? Can impacts be avoided or minimized? How?

3) Impacts to Viewshed - The proposed project would alter current views on the Missouri River. The existing bridge is highly-visible structure, and has emerged over the past 130 years as the picture-postcard image of Bismarck-Mandan. It is admired for its aesthetic value and is used prolifically as a backdrop to family photos and in local and regional advertising. How and to what degree would the proposed project impact the aesthetic qualities of the Missouri River in its viewshed? Can impacts be avoided or minimized? How?

There are many other potential impacts the EIS is sure to explore, including impacts to threatened or endangered species, air and water quality, socio-economic impacts, aesthetics, and noise. I expect to see these included. I also expect to see all potential impacts analyzed for all proposed actions and alternatives. 

I urge the USCG to consider the severity of these and other environmental impacts, and select an alternative that keeps the bridge in place. It is a tangible link to our heritage and vital to the social and economic character of Bismarck and Mandan.

I appreciate the opportunity to comment and look forward to the draft EIS.

As life-long citizen of Bismarck and working professional, I am writing to ask that you preserve the historic railroad bridge that crosses the Missouri River at Bismarck-Mandan for a multitude of reasons. 

As a professional photographer and filmmaker, I know that there is nothing more iconic than that rail bridge here in our community. Nearly every family in our community has a picture taken with that bridge in the background. In our modern world we have been suffering from a loss of local identity, and this bridge is a historic marker of our community's identity and sense of place. When people of North Dakota see the image of this bridge we immediately where we are. It has both value to me as a citizen, as well as value as a filmmaker and photographer, who constantly gets requests to record video and take photos with that bridge in the background. It can help set period-sensitive films from historic moments in time as well as give a rustic, gritty, prairie and industrial message.  

As an avid biker and father of kids who love to bike the trails along the river, I can see nothing that would be more useful, practical and add value to our community members' outdoor experiences and enjoyment of the river than to preserve that bridge and turn it into a pedestrian and bike-friendly bridge to connect Bismarck and Mandan. 

I was at the first few public meetings to discuss this bridge's future with BNSF and the Coast Guard. I have seen many public hearings, yet it is rare to see one where democrats and republicans along with all other types of groups unanimously agree and support something as strongly we see them coming together in support of preserving this bridge. There are countless reasons offered for their support, and the opposition comes from BNSF, yet their opposition is not based on safety, as they would like to convince people. In those meetings BNSF clearly stated the bridge is not an immediate threat and is structurally sound. As we pressed them with further questions, it became clear that their desire is to have a bridge that can support a second track - as well as one that can carry railcars that are stacked double-high - and this bridge has a height limit. They had no testing or proof that the structural integrity of the bridge is in any way lacking. So, what they really need is to build a second bridge beside this bridge and not to demolish this important piece of history and bridge to a healthy community structure for the future generations to enjoy. We do not have enough structures or venues to enjoy our river like we should. Please, I urge you not to let them destroy this bridge. There is an organized group here in our community that will raise the money to preserve and transform this bridge- and insodoing, better our community.

Thank you,
James Kambeitz

The bridge is part of the landscape, portrayed in thousands of photographs from the 1880s forward including the steamboat era, the WWI training facility at Camp Frazier at the foot of the the bridge on the Bismarck side, to the present. We have lost too much historic architecture and this is the opportunity to retain a bridge that is a unique signature for these communities so they are not just another town with the same fast food restaurants, gas stations, hotels and chain retail stores as every other town in America.
Saving the bridge will also provide outdoor recreation for residents and visitors alike, always a plus for attracting both to the communities. BNSF has been a community partner for many years and I can't imagine it would be a great hardship for a successful corporation of its size to construct a bridge replacement a little farther along the river and transfer ownership of the existing bridge to the community.

This includes large-scale infrastructure projects and countless scores of employees. Since the market crash of 1873, the Northern Pacific has capitalized on the government's largess to a grand degree, even spinning off entire new industrial corporations taking advantage of the forest lands of the Pacific Northwest. The legacy of the Land Grant has had indelible impacts on large swaths of the NW United States.

The arrangement has worked out very strongly in the railroad's (and Warren Buffett's) favor of late. With record quarterly profits recently, the railroad is reaping billions and billions of dollars in profit annually from the arrangement established with the government back in 1864, now 156 years ago.

A key feature in the development of the railroad was the arrival of the first trains in Bismarck, North Dakota, in 1873, followed 3 months later by a global financial collapse spawned by the bankruptcy of the over-extended Northern Pacific Railroad. For nearly 10 years, westward progress was halted at Bismarck, North Dakota, with the Mighty Missouri River blocking the way.

Incredibly, the river presented such a daunting challenge that a tunnel underneath the river was considered more likely for nearly a year prior to settling on the Bismarck-Mandan Rail Bridge as the solution to the problem. This allowed Bismarck to grow large enough to be designated as the Territorial Capital and later to become the state capital.

The bridge was built at a very high-profile site, the exact site where bison crossed the river on their annual migrations, where Native American tribes had gathered for centuries to hunt the bison, and a major cultural crossroads on the plains. The site was known as ""The Crossing"", where Native Americans had retreated ahead of General Sibley 20 years earlier after being chased out of Minnesota. Amazing, the bridge has wothstood the test of time and its hand-carved stone pillars remain sturdy today.

The bridge at this location represents for more than simply one of the most impressive engineering feats of the American Frontier. It tells the story of the Northern Pacific Railway better than any other surviving feature of the road. It is a National Treasure. I hope the parties deciding the fate of this bridge can introduce more of this consideration into the rhetoric surrounding the new construction project. There is large opportunity here for BNSF to take positive action in preserving their own and our Nation's history by honoring the existing Historic Bridge. I am grateful for this opportunity to express my feelings in this instance, as the bridge is an anchoring cultural touchpoint in the local community and the state of North Dakota and deserves respect as such.",,,,,,,

The bridge is well over one hundred years old and as it further ages, I believe the cost to maintain it to safe standards for pedestrian use is only going to increase. There are already two pedestrian walkways connecting Bismarck to Mandan, and an additional walkway is unnecessary. There has been no plan submitted by the group spearheading the effort to save the bridge, regarding the cost to purchase and maintain the structure. The walkway use plan benefits only a select group of recreational users. My main objection is the financial burden will have to be born by all the taxpayers to satisfy the wants and desires of a few.",,,,,,,

I am writing to ask that you preserve the historic railroad bridge that crosses the Missouri River at Bismarck-Mandan. 

From an environmental perspective, demolishing the bridge means the waterway will absorb all that rubble and debris. If the structure is useful, even though not as a train bridge, why not keep it intact and let it be used by the public? As an outdoor enthusiast that loves the ecosystem of the river and the great hiking and biking opportunities on both sides of the river, turning the bridge into a pedestrian-only and bicycle-only route will add value to our community members lives. From the minutes of prior public meetings on this bridge, BNSF assured the public that the bridge is structurally sound. If it is feasible to build a second bridge and leave this one in place, preserving both an important piece of our local and national history as well as increasing enjoyment of the Missouri River's recreational opportunities, we have much to lose here in its demolition. 

Please, I urge you not to let them destroy this bridge. There is an organized group here in our community that will raise the money to preserve and re-purpose this bridge for the enjoyment of generations to come. 

Sincerely,
",,,,,,,

It is a festival that celebrates the great history of the Missouri river and its importance over centuries.  A part of the celebration is a Parade of Lights which presently will use the Memorial Bridge to assemble veterans and youth on the evening of the parade.  The city of Bismarck presently requires us to apply for permission to close the bridge in order to host a parade for the veterans before the riverboat leads the parade up the river.  If we were able to preserve the existing railway bridge, it would be a dream come true to celebrate both the veteran's parade and the parade of lights (which is hosted by the American Cancer Society and a pediatric cancer charity, Bravehearts for Kids.)
Please consider the request to preserve this iconic bridge.  Having a bridge like this will greatly improve our walking path system in Bismarck and Mandan and also make the celebration of the Missouri river into a major attraction.",,,,,,,

We live in an area with relatively few old buildings or structures. While we are still connected to our ancestors and our heritage, connection occurs mostly through pictures, stories, and the elderly. 

The BNSF Railway Bridge across the Missouri River at Bismarck is perhaps the only old structure left that serves to connect us to the early American settlers to this area. As such, it plays a vital role in our community as one of our only historic landmarks. 

Beyond the historic connotations, the BNSF Railway Bridge also serves as an iconic backdrop to the mighty Missouri River, and is a go-to photography spot for graduation photos and wedding pictures in our community. In fact, my wife and I had our engagement photos taken on the banks of the Missouri directly in front of the BSNF Railway Bridge. 

Given it's prominence in our history and our conception of the most beautiful spots in the city, I believe it makes a lot of sense to preserve this bridge and give it an ongoing role in the vibrance of the community. One of the best ideas I have heard is to make it a walking bridge, and connecting point between Bismarck and Mandan. With the continued economic development of the waterfront property on both sides of the river, such a bridge could be a hub of commercial and cultural activity.

Every year, less and less remains of our past, and to lose this bridge would be one of the biggest blows in terms of teaching our children and grandchildren our state's history. The eastern side of this country preserves history all the time; let's remember, the east coast has much more of it than North Dakota as they are much older. Other than churches and township schools, and court-houses, there isn't much in North Dakota that tells us about our past. I ask you to remember this when making the decision. This isn't the Brooklyn bridge by any means, but it is to the people of this state. It would encourage children to get off their devices and go outside for a walk across the bridge, and it would be a huge tourism attraction. Very little remains of 19th Century Dakota history  much of it is under Lake Sakakawea. Please do not destroy one of the only things we have left from early statehood. ",,,,,,,

Besides the concerns with navigating around multiple sets of piers, I would be very concerned with ice jams forming in this area.  I believe there would need to be study completed that assures the residents of Bismarck that this additional structure wouldn't increase our chances of ice jams and flooding up stream.  

The owner of the bridge has clearly stated that the 130 year old bridge has reached it's useful life.  I don't understand any plan that involves keeping a bridge above the river that has reached it's useful life and is no longer safe.   If the bridge owner is not allowed to remove the bridge as they requested, the USCG should be held responsible for damages caused by the bridge including ice jams and subsequent flooding.

Studying and considering the historical loss if the current bridge were to be removed is vital to the scope of the EIS.  Furthermore, to bypass any portion or process associated with the EIS in order to expedite a project or appease any business or organization diminishes the values upon which this country was founded.  Historical preservation, wildlife, and the integrity of the people who live in the Bismarck-Mandan area deserve a complete study of impacts associated with all alternatives to BNSF's proposal.  It is imperative that the Human Environment, as stated in 40 CFR  1508.14, be considered in detail as the current BNSF bridge is vital to the Bismarck-Mandan area's defining history and current identity.  

We live in a time of disposal - and with even if the EIS includes mitigation efforts addressing aesthetics, nothing built into a new bridge can replace the history and beauty that exists with one built prior to the Eiffel Tower.  I recently read an article on how people throughout the world experience grief from the loss of buildings -Notre Dame, Brazil National Museum, Dresden buildings, Haiti Presidential Palace - to name a few (see https://www.bbc.com/news/world-47952725).  Most of the examples given were due to natural disasters, yet in all cases the grief associated with losing a cultural attraction is real, and it will happen if this bridge is removed.  The bridge predates our statehood and is a defining part of our legacy; at some point the cost associated with intentional destruction of historical structures needs to be unreservedly analyzed and considered. If it is, I believe one will find it is worth much more than merely a ""structure approaching the end of its useful service life"".

Railways carry toxic commodities in large volumes that have the potential to create catastrophic situations.  These bridges should not be considered for remote operations for the safety of the general public and environment.   

Due to the nature of the hazardous materials transported in large volumes by railways they should not allow bridges to be remotely operated.  The Paulsboro NJ bridge operated remotely with a failure message that was not taken seriously contributed to 23,000 gallons of toxic vinyl chloride being release into the Mantia Creek.   A bridge tender should have been onsite and in communication with the supporting maintenance workers for the locking mechanism to prevent the incident.

The remote operation does not take into account the safety of the materials traversing the bridge, but only the availability of the channel for marine traffic which is a disservice to the public.

A train on a moveable bridge with the operated remotely.  A remote operator can not smell a hot wheel bearing, hear a sticking break, catch the sparks from frictions of overloaded cars, an open door, shifted lading, banding straps that have come unsecured, lading that had shifted, and leaking cars.  The current operators provide a priceless c100 inspections during a time when staffing has been cut, more pressure than ever for ontime departures, and detectors are being removed.  The operator protects the railroad assets but also the tresspassers walking along the track, and general public by inspecting and notifying the train of defects before they become an emergecny situation.   Before a rail bridge is remoted it should be verified that the local first responders have the equipment and training to respond to these sites and possible situations.  This is not just a coast guard issue but a concern for the community.  Recently railroads have been under a pressure from wallstreet to reduce operating costs. The operator catching these situations with an ounce of prevention is a cost savings already in place.  Safety recorders and rail incidents are reflecting cutting the very things that keep costs down, but what is the cost of recent tragic incidents  to the community?  ",,,,,,,

I'm a maritime instructor at the Alaska Maritime Training Center, as well as coastal Alaskan resident, and have worked on several simulator projects funded by the PWSRCAC related to Prince William Sound vessel activity and believe those projects improved safety and were a benefit to all the stakeholders in the region including industry.

Funding these safety related vessel navigation simulations is just a small part of the great work the PWSRCAC does for the community every year.

In the interest of full disclosure, approximately a year ago I was appointed to the Board of Directors of the PWSRCAC as the representative of the City of Seward.

I support the re-certification of the Prince William Sound Regional Citizen's Advisory Council (PWSRCAC).

This advisory group monitors the activities of terminal facilities and crude oil tankers operating in Prince William Sound, and provides an effective forum for dialogue between stakeholders in the region.

In The Federalist No. 78, Alexander Hamilton noted that ""the subjecting of men to punishment for things which, when they were done, were breaches of no law"" is among ""the favorite and most formidable instruments of tyranny.""  In this case Captain Anderson, who has served as the Captain of the Port of Philadelphia since June 2017, announces a temporary interim regulation on January 28 without notice, which he needs to have gone into effect several weeks earlier on January 12, 2020.

In this case the United States Army Corps of Engineers has undertaken to dredge the 40 foot deep main ship channel to a depth of 45 feet for its entire 102 mile length.  This project appears to have begun in 2012.  Currently the crews need a safety zone to blast near Marcus Hook.  It would seem that 7 years would have given the Captain enough time to enact the rule properly, especially where as here, he adopted a similar rule last year, see Docket Number USCG-2019-0031.

Certainly to anyone who has transgressed in the past few weeks, this rule is Unconstitutional as applied.  More alarming, this rule provides specific information and instructions which could have been invaluable to mariners prior to its publication.  I would like to think that an Officer who rises to the rank of Captain in the United States Coast Guard should have enough foresight to publish this information in a timely manner.  One would assume that the safety of those transiting the Philadelphia Main Ship Channel would be of utmost importance to the Captain of the Port of Philadelphia.",,,,,,,

In speaking about the part where they just applied the rule immediately without any process of public validation or anything really stuck out to me because there is normally a protocol the rule makers must follow to enforce a rule. In this case, I think this was good idea concerning public safety because the sailors probably would have been pretty upset but it is a necessary measure. Involving the Coast Guard and using the APA as guideline and security was another great thing because it shows the severity and seriousness of this issue. I am also in agreement with the three safety zoning areas because it a decent amount and still gives leeway to a lot of the river and surrounding areas. The safety zones also don't take up that much space and still give access to pass one vessel at a time. The 24-hour notice of passage to the COTP is a huge asset to this rule because it shows that they care about the public safety but as well as our economy by letting vessels pass but only one at a time and blocking off enough space to prevent harm to the vessels, the people, and the marine life.

I am responding with comments regarding the Consolidation of Redundant Coast Guard Boat Stations.  I am an active yachtsman and a USCG Master Licensed Captain on the Chesapeake Bay. I have been boating the Chesapeake for over 46 years. 

This news is both shocking and what I believe to be a hazard to the marine community of the Chesapeake Bay.  The town of Oxford, first and foremost, love the Oxford USCG Station. Next, the Tred Avon River, as well as its immediate surrounding tributaries, are some of the most highly traveled and worked waters on the Bay and in North America.   

The need for emergency resources on the Bay is critical.  The Maryland Dept of Natural Resources Police has limited crews and duty stations. There is often no crew on duty in the area you need them when an emergency may arise, due to the vast size of the Bay. This, of course, slows the response time to any emergency. So then the public must rely on the Volunteer Fire companies and the USCG.  If we take away the Oxford Station, this makes a significant impact on the mariners of our Bay, which will include imports and exports on the Bay, the shipping industry,  and also Maryland Watermen.  An estimated 3,000 men and women brave the elements daily to catch their respective limits and sell to the markets.  

As you know our current stations include: Boat Stations
Annapolis
Crisfield
Curtis Bay
STA (Small) Stillpond
Ocean City
Oxford
St. Inigoes
Washington
This span between the stations is incredibly vast. The next closest station to Oxford would be Annapolis.  The response time would be tremendous. A decision to remove the Oxford Station in great tragedy.  

I hope you will reconsider.

I am providing comment on the Consolidation of Redundant Coast Guard Boat Stations, in particular concerning the proposed closing of the Oxford Station. My name is Angie Hengst and I am the Race Director of the two IRONMAN triathlons in Cambridge, IRONMAN 70.3 Eagleman which takes place in June and IRONMAN Maryland which takes place in September. Both of our events secure a Marine Event Permit from the Coast Guard and since the events' inception, we have relied on the resources and personnel from the Oxford Station to provide support during the swim portion of both of our events (1.2 mile and 2.4 mile swim for each race, respectively). Our Eagleman event has upwards of 2500 participants and IRONMAN Maryland has close to 2300 participants. As you can imagine, having that many people in the water and keeping them safe requires many resources. While we have rescue boats, lifeguards and other swim safety personnel to monitor the swimmers, the Oxford Coast Guard monitor boat traffic and keep our swim course secure during the event. They will also provide any backup emergency response, if needed. The Station personnel report to our swim course and are in place by 6am for each of our races. If this station was closed, personnel from stations over an hour to two hours away would need to arrive at this time to support our events. Additionally, the Oxford station is very familiar with our waters and courses and are able to provide the exact support needed to keep our event and participants safe. While I understand these events only happen twice a year, the number of participants is significant. We have several All Agency meetings prior to the event and the Station's close proximity to Cambridge allows them to easily attend these meetings and work closely with other local agencies and IRONMAN staff prior to the event. I believe that closing the Oxford Station could negatively impact our event and on behalf of IRONMAN would urge that it's consolidation be reconsidered.

Thank you,
Angie Hengst

For one, the consolidation would most likely increase efficiency regarding communication between those in distress and the U.S. Coast Guard, as calls would be directed to a singular site within a given region. In addition, as mentioned in the summary, there are fewer distress calls compared to that of the past, due to an increase in boating technology and safety. This, of course, creates less of a demand for a large quantity of coast guard stations. Consolidation would also prove to be a great financial benefit for the U.S. Coast Guard, as the funds saved from closing the five U.S. Coast Guard stations could then be used to update current technology or increase the number of personnel on-site. 

On the opposite end of the spectrum, although our boating technology has increased over the years, a larger quantity of U.S. Coast Guard stations would ensure that emergency situations may be reached at a faster rate. Although more stations involve a ""complicated response system,"" when on the water, time is crucial. Additionally, if these stations were to be shut down, there are externalities that can affect the surrounding community. The stations that were shut down hold the potential to fall into decay if not immediately sold, creating a public nuisance. 

In conclusion, I believe that the U.S. Coast Guard should begin consolidation one station at a time instead of five. This action would provide a sample for what the larger impact might be on both the community and the response times for emergency situations. Once the trial period is over, I believe that a decision to close the remaining stations can then be made.

Dear Admiral Sibley,

     I am responding to your request for comments on the Consolidation of Redundant Coast Guard Boat Stations.  I am the owner/operator of the oldest privately operated ferry, Established in 1683 and have been a USCG 100 Ton Master for 48 years.  

     The news of the Oxford Station being on the list for closure would be a terrible mistake and a hazard to the mid bay safety to the many recreational and commercial mariners who ply the waters daily.  The current central location in this heavily utilized section of the bay lends great support to the overall safety of our area.  While there are other assets available thru the Maryland DNR and local volunteer fire departments, they are not manned full time and of course it is well noted the volunteer departments are suffering from severe manpower shortages.  All the well-known short comings, contribute to the delayed response times, which may have catastrophic consequences.  The distance to the Annapolis Boat Station is over 25 miles and the response times due to weather and crew availability can quickly become extended.

     Please reconsider the Oxford Station closure in view of the long-term negative impact on the Chesapeake Mariner community. 

Very truly yours,
Captain Tom Bixler

Please reconsider the closing of the Fishers Island, NY Coast Guard Station.  The station is located only a short distance from Race Rock Lighthouse, which is in the most treacherous waters of Long Island Sound.  On any given weekend during fishing season, there are as many as 60 boats fishing in that area.  Countless others boat through that passage year-round.  The waters flow extremely fast in that location and make it very dangerous.  The Fishers Island Coast Guard Station is needed to protect lives and rescue people who run into problems there.  I have had problems in the past at that location.  I was able to self help, but it's comforting to know that the station is less than a mile from such a dangerous waterway.  Please do not close the Fishers Island Coast Guard Station.  

Thank you,
Jon Fuller  ",,,,,,,

Swimmers and operators would not need to worry about safety concerns with the help of safety kayaks and boats through this channel that contains multiple public and private facilities along both shorelines. Minimizing the number of vessels passing through this channel over the course of four hours may also decrease any potential discharge on the surface of the water that participants would swim through. My only concern is how close the participants are swimming to the fishing piers, would there also be a four hour pier fishing restriction for the safety of the participants? For this short amount of time and small portion of the Choptank River, I do not see a large negative environmental impact. Possibly, non-participants could be encouraged to pick up any litter they see while walking the shoreline and piers watching the swimmers, this could promote a positive environmental impact.",,,,,,,

Also having zones that address the needs of all participating in the event. From the racers to the spectators and the general public who are boating separately. Not allowing other boats to operate during events can have a negative on the event, an event that is trying to increase the number of sailing events for everyone to watch.

(v) Zone ""D"" means the No Spectating or Loitering Area. This zone will allow vessels to transit in and out of marinas, piers, and vessel launch areas throughout the duration of the Sail Grand Prix. All vessels shall maintain headway and shall not loiter or anchor within the confines of Zone ""D"". Mariners can transit Zone ""D"" during the Sail Grand Prix 2020 event, decreasing the impact of the special local regulation to the San Francisco waterfront.

Having section (v) inplace helps inform how the general public is meant to navigate during the event. Without this, others might navigate their normal ruites without knowing the impact.

Thank you for providing a well thought out regulation.

However, as a frequent kiteboarder at Crissy Field, I must object to the extreme length in time of the exclusion period. Preventing access between 11:30 am and 5:30 pm effectively bans kiteboarding from Crissy field, one of the few good access points to kiteboarding on the bay, on those days. With Sail GP's stated goal of 20 minute races, and 3 races a day, I must request that the closure be shortened, perhaps to 150-180 minutes. This would seem to still allow plenty of time for the sailboat racing, while still allowing residents access to the waters near their home.",,,,,,,

For sailors of all kinds, the waters offshore of Crissy Field in San Francisco are one of the wonders of the world. There are literally dozens of races held there each year, from the iconic Big Boat series, to the more prosaic Thursday and Friday night kiteboard and windsurf races. The waters are used by many others, including paddle boarders for their iconic race to Ocean Beach, outrigger canoes, kayaks, and fishing boats. Most of these activities occur without disruption to other users, relying on common courtesy and the right-of-way rules of the water to allow users to participate simultaneously. Only a few eventsAmerica's Cup, Fleet Week, and SailGP seek restrictions on other users.

The right of access to the water is so important in California that it is enshrined in the State Constitution. California has taken a number of steps to assure that access is protected, from establishing the nation's first coastal program to adopting legislation to encourage development of a Water Trail. Crissy Field has been designated under the Bay Plan as an important recreational beach where access for windsurfing is protected, and has also been designated as a Water Trail site.",,,,,,,

I consider this a track record that should serve as a model for large events such as SailGP, which provided substantial benefits to commercial events while minimizing negative impacts to the local sailing community. Even the extraordinarily high-profile America's Cup avoided large take-over style exclusion zones by maintaining passing channels nearshore for small craft, and limiting exclusions to around 3pm PST. I want to encourage the US Coast Guard to inform decision making on SailGP exclusion zones and times accordingly. Sincerely, Joachim Pfeiffer, San Francisco",,,,,,,

It's a pretty obvious tactic at the end of the day SailGP: Ask for the sky, and see what falls from it. If they can inch something out that way, hey, they can still chalk up a win while claiming how they'd given all these #faux concessions.
I take it that all this is going to have to go through the process with the powers. Other than that I am inclined to think the proposal in front of us should be dismissed off-hand and replaced with something that mirrors what regattas were doing in the past and that was agreeable to all parties involved.
