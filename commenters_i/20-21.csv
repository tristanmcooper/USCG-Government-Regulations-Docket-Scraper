But nothing could be further from the truth. Here's a classic: getting Trump supporters to laugh by mocking an Indian-American's name:

""... and Ka-MA-la or what KA-mala or Ka-MA-la or Ka-mala-mala-mala, I don't know. Whatever."" - Senator David Perdue, October 16 2020

And Perdue is hardly the only GOP comedian. President Trump has a great routine where he imitates a reporter's disability. And Trump gave the Presidential Medal of Freedom to Rush Limbaugh, who for decades has mocked African-Americans, Hispanics, Asian-Americans and women.

In short the GOP is a joke. Vote. Them. Out.",,,,,,,

The Arctic is melting fast, & many areas are remote so an accident with an oil tanker would be devastating and not easily addressed in remote areas.  In addition, a spill would affect the livelihood of native peoples in the region.

Also, both the drilling itself as well as a spill would likely kill or injure native wildlife at a time when we are so many species are declining or endangered, adding to the threat of extinction  as described in the recent UN report.

Finally, additional fossil fuels use will harm the earth, dramatically increasing climate change, which has already resulted in unprecedented flooding, fires, heat waves and other problems for every person on this planet.

I oppose this route study and any further fossil fuel extraction in the Arctic.

I urge you to extend the comment period for all the above reasons, so  many other voices will be heard.

Research is ongoing in the Western Canadian Arctic to identify low impact shipping corridors and to adhere to the management and conservation objectives laid out in the Inuvialuit Final Agreement, as well as the Integrated Oceans Management Plan for the Beaufort Sea (attached below). 

Current research occurring within the western Canadian Arctic includes the Beaufort Regional Environmental Assessment (BREA) which has produced a significant amount of valuable data for the Canadian Beaufort Sea. ""The primary goal for BREA was to produce relevant scientific and socio-economic data that would inform project-level environmental assessments and regulatory decision-making for oil and gas activities, while strengthening the relationship between environmental assessments and integrated management and planning in the region"".

The Marine Chart Division of NOAA's Office of Coast Survey is providing comments and related material regarding the possible establishment of shipping safety fairways along the Atlantic Coast of the United States detailed in the Federal Register (Volume 85, Number 119, pages 37034-37040) dated June 19, 2020Docket No. USCG-2019-0279. The Marine Chart Division is responsible for charting U.S. coastal waters and certain inland waterways. In keeping with that responsibility, the division depicts the locations of shipping safety fairways in navigable waterways as shown on NOAA ENCElectronic Navigational Charts.

I am a nautical cartographer with extensive experience maintaining nautical publications (United States Coast Pilot) and working with Federal regulations as they relate to NOAA's suite of nautical products. I am currently assigned to the Nautical Data Branch of the Marine Chart Division.

The nine proposed fairways were plotted in Esri ArcMap and evaluated against the Electronic Navigational Charts (ENCs) for accuracy and for noting any potential obstructions, fixed structures or administrative areas that intersect the fairways, which could possibly impact safe navigation. The results of this evaluation produced approximately 100 features intersecting the proposed fairways. It should be noted that obstruction features categorized as non-dangerous are generally omitted from this list. I created a file geodatabase of polygons that encompass the features on the intersecting ENCs. Please note that the polygons encompassing these features are a bit larger than the actual features as depicted on the ENCs. Due to the limitations on uploading certain file types to the website www.regulations.gov, this data will be provided to the U.S. Coast Guard as a file geodatabase (.gdb)  and a comma separated values file (.csv) in a separate email message to you.

In addition, I found a possible discrepancy in one of the proposed fairways. For the Delaware Bay Eastern Approach Cutoff Fairway, one corner position (3849'48""N., 07434'36""W.) appears to have been omitted from the ANPRM in the Federal Register. I believe that the western end of this fairway should coincide with the eastern end of the existing traffic lane. Please refer to the ACPARS Proposed Routing - Northern Area map as posted in the docket.

Features included in the file geodatabase were identified in a specific time frame and are subject to revision or removal from the ENCs, which are continually updated. In addition, new features may be added to the affected ENCs after you receive this comment. Therefore, you should download the most recent ENCs from the Office of Coast Survey website at https://www.charts.noaa.gov/InteractiveCatalog/nrnc.shtml. If you need assistance with downloading and or viewing ENCs, please let me know.

The purpose of the file geodatabase features is to facilitate the U.S. Coast Guard's decision-making process for positioning the fairways. I defer to the U.S. Coast Guard to make any possible adjustments to the proposed fairways. If you require any further information on any of these features, then please feel free to contact me via the information I have provided.

Sincerely,

Richard H. Powell
Nautical Data Branch / Marine Chart Division

This is because it provides for the most safety precautions to be taken when establishing new LNG facilities, while also providing more flexibility for LNG facility owners since the amount of work they would have to do to get the facility approved would be reduced. This course of action is important because it would codify industry standards and establish a national baseline for these safety standards. Doing this would ensure that any future LNG facilities would follow these safety standards, protecting facility personnel, communities near the facility, and the environment alike. 
This course of action also reduces the burden to the industry while also still requiring a meeting with the Captain of the Port. This is important because the meeting with the COTP would still allow the COTP to notice any potential safety risks or other hazards that may have gone unnoticed if not for the meeting. This could allow negative impacts to be avoided, ensuring the most safety for personnel, communities, and the environment. This meeting is important because without it, something bad might happen as a result of the LNG facility being established.

Dear Mr. Smith:  

RE:  DOCKET NUMBER USCG-2019-9444 - OPERATONAL RISK ASSESSMENTS FOR WATERFRONT FACILITIES HANDLING LIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS AS FUEL, AND UPDATES TO INDUSTRY STANDARDS

Under an Interagency Agreement (IA), Participating Agencies are responsible for exercising regulatory authority over the siting, design, construction and operation of Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) facilities, and related land and marine safety and security issues.  The IA ensures complete assessment of all facility operations and hazards and to improve the cooperation among the Participating Agencies to share information gathered, considered and relied upon by each of them, and specifically providing the necessary support for the NEPA

FERC (Lead Federal Agency):  Conducts environmental, safety, and security reviews of LNG plants and related pipeline facilities and prepares overall NEPA documentation, including tanker operation; terminal construction and operation; and environmental and cultural impacts.

RSPA:  Promulgates and enforces safety regulations and standards for the transportation and storage of LNG in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce under the pipeline safety laws. 
 
USCG:  As a Participating Agency, exercises regulatory authority over LNG facilities which affect the safety and security of port areas and navigable waterways. 
 
The role FERC plays in the LNG approval process cannot be overstated.  Unfortunately, FERC disclaimed jurisdiction over small-scale, inland LNG export facilities without a formal Rulemaking that would have required LNG facility developers to file Petitions for Declaratory Order with FERC to determine federal jurisdiction.  As a result, companies, e.g. New Fortress Energy (NFE), are siting, constructing and operating LNG export facilities on very small parcels of land in densely populated communities. e.g. NFE's LNG facility sited on an under-13-acre site in Miami, Florida, that began exporting containerized (ISO) LNG from Port of Miami on February 5, 2016, and in March of 2017, began transporting LNG by rail to Port Everglades, Florida.  This facility has exported approximately 390,000 Mcf of natural gas from Port Everglades from January 1st through August 30th of this year, and I understand that the USCG has not as yet established Exclusion Zones around ships that are transporting containerized LNG that are similar to those found in 33 CFR  165.110 - Safety and Security Zone; Liquefied Natural Gas Carrier Transits and Anchorage Operations, Boston, Massachusetts.

The proposed Rule would revise the Coast Guard's existing regulations to allow waterfront facilities handling LNG as fuel to conduct an Operational Risk Assessment (ORA) instead of a Waterway Suitability Assessment (WSA) without first obtaining Captain of the Port approval.  It appears the proposed Rule would render the terms of the referenced Interagency Agreement moot.  

In 2007, Weaver's Cove Energy performed an Operational Risk Assessment that concluded the approach to their proposed waterfront LNG terminal in Fall River, Massachusetts, was ""suitable"" for LNG tank traffic.  However, in an actual Waterway Suitability Assessment, the U. S. Coast Guard determined that the approach was ""unsuitable"" due to ""navigational safety challenges.""  The ruling upheld previous USCG decisions handed down in 2007 and 2008, effectively blocking the proposed LNG terminal.

If the proposed Rule is approved, LNG developers and others will have yet another opportunity to make up their own rules as they go along.  Schematics covering density and character of marine traffic, locks, bridges, or other man-made obstructions in the waterway, along with factors adjacent to the facility, e.g. water depths, tidal range, protection from high seas, natural hazards, underwater pipelines and cables and distance of berthed vessels from the channel, and other issues that affect the safety and security of the waterway, could easily be manipulated to produce the best outcomes ""on paper."" 

If the USCG were to approve the proposed Rule, I fear you will be giving LNG facility developers and others carte blanche to run amok, and unfortunately, potential ""unintended consequences"" could include immeasurable loss of life, severe damage to property and critical infrastructure, and permanent ecological damage.  


Sincerely,
Cecile T, Scofield

Under the Steering an Sailing Rules of The Road:
Rule 2:  At what point does an automated system make a conscious decision given all of the details of a situation to deviate from a rule in order to avoid a collision?

Rule 5: Lookout.  In certain circumstances it becomes necessary to supplement the Lookout.  On a purely autonomous vessel with no personnel onboard, how does this occur?  When does an AI on a manned vessel determine it needs help?

Rule 9: Whether or not a channel is a ""Narrow Channel"" is currently a judgement call.  There is not a specific definitions and TSAC reviewed the Rule and upheld the recommendation to maintain the flexibility in application because it is extremely dependent on prevailing circumstances as well as the nature and maneuverability of the two vessels.  Can an AI make this determination?

Rule 11: Applicability to steering and sailing rules of vessels within sight of one another.  All of these rules depend not only on the plotting capabilities of navigation electronics but depend on the ability to determine a contacts aspect and apparent heading in addition to the vectors determined by AIS and Radar.  The position of the navigation lights is a factor in determining right of way and actions that may need to be taken.  Will the AI be able to tell the difference between a sailboat and a seaplane and such for vessel not required to carry AIS?

In many cases with the Steering and Sailing Rules, particularly on inland rivers and in narrow channels, passing arrangements need to made well ahead of time and require agreement between the two vessels.  Disagreements occur, intentions of what will occur or what maneuvers will be made need to be understood.  The proposed location of the meeting can be very specific and often utilizes local visual landmarks and features.  Can an AI understand in a river ""not to come up past the old red camp under the point and stay tucked in under the dike on the 2 whistle""?  What if that arrangement is not satisfactory?  What does the AI do if it's proposal receives a 5 whistle response?  Will these vessel be able to comply with the Bridge to Bridge Radiotelephone Act requiring verbal communications?

Another Challenge on the Western Rivers may be the shifting currents and channel conditions.  On coastal and ocean voyages, traffic lanes and sailing lines may be fairly static and set and drift can be accounted for as long as the vessel is on a particular track.  That is not always an option on rivers routes whereas from transit to transit the track line may need to change based on river conditions which are most often judged by telltale eddys and ""tells"" from current interaction with buoys, bridge piers and the appearance of surface currents?

46 CFR 4.05:  How is an autonomous vessel expected to provide reports to the USCG in the event of a casualty for the 4.05 as well as hazardous condition requirements.  Initial reports are verbal now. Will the Command Centers and NRC be able to communicate with these vessels?  What format will the transfer of information take place?  Any report that is given or received verbally will need to be addressed.

47 CFR Radiotelephone log entries--How will the vessel transcribe necessary information and how will it record distress signals witnessed?

EPA NPDES-VGP inspections--How is the AI expected to fulfill the inspection and recordkeeping requirements?  

The Marine Safety Manuals governing manning will need to be revised.

The main concerns in my opinion as specified above are situations which require a conversation and agreement between two vessels in less than static conditions; understanding of intended actions that have not occurred yet; decisions which require evaluation of visual clues; understanding of local terminology, landmarks and lore; and situations which require verbal communication.  These vessels may need to rank somewhere after seaplanes in the pecking order and remain clear of all other vessels.

A secondary concern is reliability of function.  Technology is fairly well distributed throughout modern society and has been employed for decades an many roles.  But I often have issues with automobile nav systems, laptops and cell phones where the do unexpected things at unexpected times and may need intervention to get back on track.  If this happens in an area where it poses a navigational risk, how will it be addressed? 

To another commenters point, who is held accountable for marine casualties involving these vessels?  The owner?  The programmer?  Mariners have a credential at stake for negligence or misdeeds.  Who will be held accountable for misbehavior by automated vessels?

Hopefully we can work through these issues in a responsible planned manner.

MTB provides shared situational awareness and navigational services for the vessels on the digital seaway and traffic monitoring, management and control services for the future remote operation centers as well as existing ports and VTS centers on the shore side.
By using MTB services, it is possible to develop various end-user interfaces and applications for different use cases and end-users. This is the most cost-efficient way to enable vessel autonomy development and take new technologies into use already today in a controlled way.
In the final phase MTB can communicate with long range deep-sea autonomous vessels and digitally escort them safely to the port. However, there are many other opportunities before that.",,,,,,"https://downloads.regulations.gov/USCG-2019-0698-0005/attachment_1.pdf",

Definitions issues:
There is currently no international definition of what an autonomous or unmanned ship is, what the various levels of autonomy are and whether an autonomous ship is a ship under international law.

Absence of crew issues:
UNCLOS defines that all ships must be “in the charge of a master and officers who possess appropriate qualifications”. SOLAS, MARPOL, STCW and the Paris MoU as well as the EU directive 16/2009 on PSC all presume that the master will be present onboard.

Issues of navigation rules:
It is expected that all ships will be capable of executing manoeuvres and steering in accordance with the basic rules of navigation as prescribed by the COLREGS.

Issue of cyber risks & connectivity:
Autonomous ships are highly dependent on computers and other robotic equipment, which could exacerbate the consequences of a cyber attack. 
No guaranteed global connectivity.

Issue of seaworthiness and error in navigation:
“Reasonably seaworthy in all respects” warranty applies to voyage policies of marine insurance at the commencement of the voyage. Under the Hague Visby Rules, to be seaworthy, the ship must be properly manned, among others.
Issues of liability and its limitation:
Generally, civil liability in shipping is regulated nationally, and it can be said that most jurisdictions require a fault-based standard.

Referencing: the International Maritime Organization (IMO),(IMO Category 3) and fully autonomous MASS with no seafarers on board (IMO category 4) for inherently dangerous vessel operations such as immersive firefighting into toxic gases and chemicals or high temperature flames that pose an extreme risk to firefighting personnel. This also holds true for scientific study of volcanic island formation by research vessels where sudden and unpredictable pyroclastic flows can instantly kill shipboard personnel. Other areas of concern would be sailors conducting minesweeping operations of other inherently dangerous military missions.

I do not recommend IMO Categories 3 and 4 for large commercial maritime vessels due to the threat of pirates seizing vessels for ransom, terrorists boarding vessels for destructive and environmental threat purposes, and lack of shipboard firefighting personnel able to attack fires as they begin.

I do recommend a drastic decrease in crew requirements though for the above mentioned categories. C white paper on MASS, Marine Technology Society Journal Vol. 53, No. 5, Sept/Oct 2019, entitled: Marine Autonomous Surface Ships on Blue Seas. I also recommend more limited crew area designs for large commercial MASS to accommodate local pilots, limited safety and security crew, maintenance personnel, USCG inspectors, and student cadets. Along with this new reduced crew structures would come a small galley facility and some retained SOLAS requirements such as fire extinguishers, SOLAS rails, ring buoys, EPIRBs, etc. This plan will also ensure the future of our merchant marine and future local pilot personnel. For further information see my award winning article published in Professional Mariner Magazine issue: July 2019, article: Maritime Jobs on the Line as Autonomous Ships Gain Steam. 

I believe that by reducing a crew size from twenty to three or four while providing pilot access is not an unreasonable compromise from those vessel owners that would see large commercial MASS IMO categories 3 and 4 if they had their way. I feel that the public safety outweighs their intended profit margin desires. My past research into the insurance requirements for these type of MASS vessels is somewhat alarming. I received feedback that states that the loss and liability is restricted by law to that of the MASS vessel's value plus its cargo, whereas the environmental and public damage can far exceed that.

My exception to drastically reducing crew personnel on large commercial vessels would have to be in the area of passenger vessels. It has been my experience that passengers pose some very unique issues that require immediate crew interdiction from both small and large numbers of crew.

To help the USCG with these proposals I suggest that the U.S. representatives to the IMO Marine Safety Committee (MSC) push for these suggested reforms to be quickly transformed into uniform international and then U.S. domestic inland laws as amendments to COLREGs after the IMO scoping study is completed.",,,,,,,

The Governors and Premiers work as equal partners to grow the regions $6 trillion economy and protect the worlds largest system of surface fresh water. In 2013, the Governors and Premiers launched a maritime initiative aimed to increase the efficiency and competitiveness of the Great Lakes St. Lawrence maritime transportation system. The Governors and Premiers Regional Maritime Strategy, released in 2016, is designed to double maritime trade, shrink the environmental footprint of the regions transportation network, and support the regions industrial core.

Smart ships represent a major leap forward in maritime technology that can help advance regional and national goals. Emerging technologies like advanced propulsion and shore-based control are revolutionizing waterborne transportation. Human error is responsible for up to 96% of maritime accidents, and smart ship technologies can leverage investments in training, pilotage, and other safety measures to reduce accidents by eliminating human exposure to hazardous or difficult tasks. Accordingly, in the near term, smart ships are particularly well-suited for research, hazardous response, and operation in dangerous conditions. The Great Lakes St. Lawrence Governors & Premiers have partnered with the maritime industry, universities, and other stakeholders to create the Smart Ships Coalition. This Coalition is working to establish this region as a global center of excellence for researching, developing, and testing smart ship technologies both on vessels and on shore. In the long term, smart ship technologies can improve the efficiency and competitiveness of the Great Lakes St. Lawrence maritime system, with the potential to create new high-paying and high-skill jobs, improve the environmental performance of regional transportation, and enhance the safety and security of shipping. To this end, the Governors and Premiers developed a Smart Ships Action Plan, which includes recommendations that the US Coast Guard (USCG) and other federal government can take to facilitate the growth of these emerging technologies. These emerging technologies present numerous opportunities for USCG to develop forward-looking policies and regulations.

(3) IMOs Interim Guidelines for MASS (Maritime Autonomous Surface Ships) trials are suitable for testing. Tests can be facilitated if the Coast Guard applies the guidelines to tests within U.S. waters.
(4) The role of remote operating centers and their requirements need to be reviewed. E.g. What is to be done if there is a fire in the remote operating center? What authorities regulate remote operating centers? etc.
(5) It is important to get common vocabulary. The terms manning and unmanned must not be mixed up with levels of autonomy, which relate to technical levels of automation on board. Remote control is also another aspect, not to be mixed up with the others. 
(6) Potential operational cost savings come mainly from two sources; reduced manning and decrease in fuel consumption. Savings in CAPEX come at high levels of autonomy where human related systems can be excluded from the ship. The savings are dependent of the ship type, route and level of autonomy, therefore a general answer cannot be given. Since the ships spend large amounts of their time and fuel in ports, the entire logistics chain should be autonomized to gain the benefits.  According to a study that One Sea has commissioned from an independent third party, in the three cases studied, the OPEX savings between current designs and the highest level of autonomy studied, ranged between 4 and 11 %. The CO2 emissions of the vessels can also be reduced, according to the study in some cases upto 20 %. The cost of accidents is also high, and it is not only included in the insurance prices.
(7) Autopilot is used extensively already globally and Dynamic Positioning utilized in current automized navigational solutions, has been used for over 20 years. Regarding machinery has remote diagnostics been utilized again for more than 20 years, although not in the whole fleet, as its cost has been rather high.
(8) U.S. has a lot of ferries that could be automated with current autodocking and autosteering technologies. Electrical propulsion makes taking in use of autonomous propulsion technologies much easier. These technologies can also be utilized with tugs and coastal feeders in the first stages of adapting the technologies.
(9) All onboard systems can be augmented through increased automation.
(10) Regarding port facilities, there are various fastenings that do not need ropes available for vessels nowadays. Also the port operations should be automatized to ensure the benefits and make port turn-around times shorter.
(11) The insurance companies calculate risks based on the occurrences in the past. It is not clear if insurance prices for these vessels would not be more costly initially.
(12) The work will change so that more of it will be done on land from the office. At the same time the safety of those still at sea is expected to increase.
(13) People working in the maritime field will need to have better computer and IT skills. They will also need better communicational skills in order to communicate with the experts in various fields.
(14) Infrastructure needs are for example increased bandwidth through satellite communication (more satellites).
(16) Increased automation will improve safety by decreasing human errors, but at the same time it will bring with it potential new threats relating to the new technologies on board. ",,,,,,,

To promote innovation and competition in this area, ability to create and use RF links should be made reasonable and easy for a wide set of potential users (individuals and commercial or government entities).  To this end, the FCC should dedicate spectrum for this use. Further, Temporary and Experimental Licenses should be made available, with as low an administrative cost (time and/or money) as reasonable to assure safety.

Q5: As stated in the comment on question 3 regarding policy changes: To improve safety through improved tracking, monitoring, and potential remote control, USCG should require all autonomous vessels maintain connectivity to a manned control station via an RF device while within 12 miles of shore. To promote innovation and competition in this area, ability to create and use RF links should be made reasonable and easy for a wide set of potential users (individuals and commercial or government entities). To this end, the FCC should dedicate spectrum for this use. Further, Temporary and Experimental Licenses should be made available, with as low an administrative cost (time and/or money) as reasonable to assure safety.

Q6: The Government already seems to consider there is benefit in the use of automated and autonomous commercial vessels, including the efficient use of labor, etc. This response focuses on the potential benefits of standardizing persistent connectivity to said vessels.
The most important benefit of the policies recommended above is safety. Persistent broadband connectivity allows unmanned vessels to continually report their location and additional sensor information (images, telemetry, etc.), which allows better tracking of those vessels as a part of overall traffic management, which in turn allows automated and autonomous vessels to avoid dangerous interactions with other manned and unmanned vessels.
A connected vessel could also report system health and potential maintenance needs. Finally, a connected vessel could be remote controlled in emergency situations, allowing manual avoidance of dangerous situations.

Q8: Wireless RF links are the most commercially feasible technology to allow automated and autonomous vessels to maintain persistent connectivity with shore-based safety and/or control centers. However, many RF capabilities lack sufficient range, data throughput, or ability to maintain connectivity in a dynamic, moving (high sea state) environment.  
There are two widely discussed technologies that could work in a mobile environment, SATCOM and 5G, but they are not economically or technologically viable. SATCOM requires expensive hardware on each vessel, a high recurring cost for necessary bandwidth, and injects too much latency for the application. Alternatively, 5G shows promise in providing low latency and high bandwidth persistent connectivity, but is only suitable for limited terrestrial locations where significant and expensive infrastructure can be installed at relatively short distances from the subscriber devices. 5G does not have the range for this application.
The best current capability to provide necessary coverage is deployment of a technology called Mobile Ad-hoc Networking (MANET), which is already commercially available, and has the ability to create a wide area coverage, creating connectivity to moving objects at ranges beyond the 12-mile inclusion zone and with 10s to 100s of Mbps of throughput such that there is enough capacity to carry command and control data, potentially to include video, radar and other sensor data.  

Q9: RF connectivity may require an RF device be added to the vessel.

Q10: Port facilities may desire to install equipment to allow persistent RF connectivity to automated and autonomous commercial vessels.

Q11: Beyond the cost of equipment to be installed on automated and autonomous vessels to allow persistent connectivity, there is administrative overhead and potential licensing fees to acquire available frequency bandwidth. The Government should strive to standardize frequencies and make usable frequency allocations easy and low cost for vessel operators.

Q14: The Government will need to assure there is a terrestrial RF infrastructure. Each vessel will need a device to connect to the infrastructure.

Q15: An open RF link may expose private data; therefore, the standard should include NSA approved encryption to the network and devices.

Q16: Unmanned vessels pose a security risk (they can be more easily commandeered by criminals) and safety risk (without permanent observation they could drift into conflict with other vessels).  Standardization on a persistent RF link to monitor and potentially remote control the vessels will help to mitigate these risks.",,,,,,,

I am commenting on behalf of the Milwaukee Harbor Yacht Club and its members.

The expansion of time that Milwaukee bridges will not open to maritime traffic has caused multiple unsafe conditions to boaters of all kinds navigating the Milwaukee River. Larger boats are being held up and being forced to hold in place while smaller watercraft and paddle operated vessels are trying to navigate around the stopped larger boat traffic. 

The two hour advance notice has also caused disruption to maritime traffic, as witnessed by many boats trying to navigate upriver and being turned around if two hour advance notice was not given. There has also been a noticeable decrease of patrons to riverside businesses due to these expanded hours of non-opening.

In addition, more boats are violating the slow no wake rules on the Milwaukee River system in order to get through bridge openings before the clock strikes 4pm. 

Please  return to the 8:30a-9:30a and 4:30p-5:30p non-opening hours.

This trial has also caused problems with smaller commercial traffic navigating the Milwaukee River, forcing them to alter schedules and loss of business.

The Association offers the following comments on the revision to paragraph (c) of 117.313, 33 CFR, promulgated in the July 13, 2020 Federal Register (2020-14578) Notice of Proposed Rulemaking for the Drawbridge Operation Regulation; New River, Fort Lauderdale, FL:

1.	The Background, Purpose and Legal Basis discussion in this Notice refers to an abbreviated vessel traffic study conducted during the month of March 2020 and made observations about average queue time for vessels.  This study was conducted just after the public was advised to remain at home due to the coronavirus epidemic and the resultant cancellation of the commuter train operations.  While this included a two-week collection of data and two-day field observation, this period of time and observed effects may not be representative of the impact on waterway users due to the disruption in train service caused by the coronavirus epidemic.  
2.	In subparagraph (3)(i) and (ii) we interpret the proposed rule to mean that the requirement for an additional 10-min. period for each hour from 12:00 p.m. and 2:59 p.m. will be required to be published by the drawbridge owner when the quarterly schedule is published and reflected on the owner's website and mobile application in addition to the fixed periods prescribed by this paragraph.
3.	In subparagraph (5), a notification of operational failure or other emergency circumstances impacting normal drawbridge operations is only conveyed to the Coast Guard Captain of the Port Miami.  We interpret the rule to mean that, once notified, the COTP will take prompt and appropriate measures to communicate these emergency circumstances to the waterway community so that appropriate measures can be taken by vessel operators. 
4.	In subparagraphs (6) and (7), a drawbridge log and a website and mobile application are required to be maintained.  To clarify who is to maintain these we recommend inserting ""by the drawbridge owner"" after ""maintained"" each time that the word appears.
5.	In subparagraph (7)(ii), timely notices to the waterway community regarding the impacts of emergency circumstances is important in addition.  We recommend adding at the end after ""schedules"" the phrase ""and impacts of emergency circumstances"".
6.	In subparagraph (8)(iii), the drawbridge is required to be opened after rail traffic has cleared the drawbridge.  We interpret the rule to mean that this will be done as soon after rail traffic has cleared to be in compliance with the requirement in subparagraph (1) that the drawbridge will be maintained in the fully open-to-navigation position for vessels at all times, except when permitted under the rule for rail traffic or inspections and minor repairs.  The following is offered as a draft replacement of paragraph (8)(iii) as a clarification (with changes underlined):
""(iii) After the rail traffic has cleared the drawbridge, the drawbridge shall promptly open and the lights shall return to green."".

	The removal of the odd summer Sunday afternoon opening hours is good as this unnecessarily limits weekend boat traffic during optimum boating hours.  In discussions a couple of years ago with the NCDOT Bridge Department, the City of New Bern Director of Public Works, and City Manager's office, no one could justify nor would take responsibility for recommending these hours, thus it is good that they are being removed with these proposed changes.
	The general change from on demand openings to openings on the half-hour and on the hour between 0600 and 2200 we believe to be unnecessary. The number of boaters transiting this bridge requiring an opening has decreased dramatically in the last two years with the loss of the Bridgepoint Marina to Hurricane Florence, and thus there should be no need to increase opening restrictions at this time. We recommend maintaining the ""on-demand"" practice for bridge openings of past years.
	The further limitation of ""rush hour"" openings to 90 minutes in the evening is unnecessarily burdensome to boaters.  We were informed by the City of New Bern Director of Public Works that he was pushed for this change because senior city employees kept catching the bridge opening when they left their office at 5:00 pm.  If this is the driver of this change, then shifting the evening ""rush hour"" opening restriction to 1630 to 1730 should be sufficient for the city workers to leave their office promptly at 5:00 pm and cross the bridge unimpeded.  This is similar to the new proposal for restricted hours during the morning rush hour. 
	It is important to keep in mind that the Cunningham Bridge is only one of a number of routes that can be taken to enter and exit New Bern and is not the primary road for emergency vehicles going to any portion of the city or county.

The southern shore of Fishers Island is another popular fishing ground. The Silver Eel Pond Station is ideally located to provide emergency assistance.

Also, please consider, the Race has a high level of commercial and military traffic. There is a fair number of ferry, barge and freighter movements through the constricted waters of the Race. These ships are providing service to all of the large ports of Long Island Sound. In addition, there are a fair number of surfaced submarines transiting to and from Naval Submarine Base New London. Again, the Silver Eel Pond Station is ideally located to provide security support and emergency assistance.

This news is deeply shocking. Proposing the USCG Station Annapolis as an alternative for mariners in distress on the Eastern Bay, of which there are many thousands every day during the boating season, and virtually year-round for our watermen, is tantamount to having no Coast Guard assistence within reach at all in anything resembling adequate timeliness. As a member of Tred Avon Yacht Club, I hope to speak for the entirety of our membership when I mention the many hundreds of yachtsmen who are routinely involved in the regattas we host annually. I mention, as one example, the Star World Championship Regatta hosted by our club in October 2018, when we drew 72 boats and crews from all over the United States, many teams from South America, and more than quite a few from Europe. The conditions during several days of this championship regatta were less than favorable (read, ""pretty nasty""), and the assistance in maintaining an orderly spectator presence, not to mention the availability of safety rescue from boats that capsized notwitstanding the efforts of their world-class sailors, by USCG Oxford Station personnel were to say the least invaluable. We are dependent upon these fine service mambers for our safety. I and my fellow townspeople sincerely hope you will appreciate the number of Eastern Shore citizens, far, far beyond th0se of us who live here in Oxford, who agree with this sentiment, and will seriously reconsider the closure of this valuable, lifesaving resource.

As I will explain below, the closing of Station Oxford would have a great impact on the Eastern Shore.  I appreciate the opportunity to submit comment in opposition to USCG-2020-0042 and hope that you recognize the impact that consolidating Station Oxford would have on the Town of Oxford and the Eastern Shore. 

I strongly oppose USCG-2020-0042 as I believe the closing of Station Oxford would be detrimental to the safety of boaters on the Eastern Shore.  Station Oxford plays a pivotal role in the safety of boaters along the waterways from northern Tilghman Island to the Little Choptank River on the eastern side of the Chesapeake Bay, and also over to Chesapeake Beach and south to Calvert Cliffs on the western side.  Many jurisdictions within this area do not have fire or police departments with boats capable of responding to an emergency on the water, leaving Station Oxford and the Department of Natural Resources, which is oftentimes otherwise occupied with enforcement activities.  The fire departments that have boats capable of responding to emergencies lack the manpower to operate the boats 24 hours a day and the qualified personnel to make water rescues.  

  Station Oxford provides timely response to any emergency on the water.  If Station Oxford is closed, the next closest station to most of the areas Station Oxford serves is Station Annapolis.  This is a major concern.  Station Annapolis is 32 nautical miles from Oxford, 25 nautical miles from St. Michaels, 45 nautical miles from Solomons, 80 nautical miles from Crisfield, and 48 nautical miles from Cambridge.  In addition to the distance, Station Annapolis requires the responding crew to travel across the entire Chesapeake Bay, which can be treacherous at times and require slower boat speeds, resulting in an increased response time. 

A nearly two-hour response time is concerning.  It is even more concerning when you consider that hypothermia can set in within 45 minutes and the fact that the Eastern Shore is known for waterfowl hunting during the winter months.  Hunters routinely take out large groups on guided boat hunts during the winter.  If a guided tour experienced an emergency on the water, the response time would be crucial to the group's survival.  Relying on a boat from Annapolis, in poor winter weather, could easily result in tragedy.  

	The distance from Station Annapolis to areas that Station Oxford serves is a huge concern for boater safety.   Station Oxford plays a significant role in educating the public on boater safety.  Without the education aspect that Station Oxford offers, the risk to our marine community will greatly increase.  The crew at Station Oxford focuses on maritime safety and protecting the local communities.  The crew spends a lot of time during prime boating season educating boaters by boarding their boat to accomplish that mission.  I am doubtful that the Eastern Shore could expect the same level of presence by Station Annapolis.  If the consolidation occurred, Station Annapolis would be responsible for a much larger area causing their time spent educating boaters to decrease.  It is not realistic to think that a crew from Station Annapolis could be as present on the Eastern Shore as the Station Oxford crew. 

Station Oxford is pivotal in providing the necessary boater education on the water.  The Department of Natural Resources does not have the time to board boats to provide boater safety education.  Without boater education, the number of accidents and emergencies on the water is certain to rise and there will not be a local Coast Guard to respond.  Ultimately, the closure of Station Oxford will cause an increase of emergencies and decreased response time, which is detrimental to the public health and safety. 

	Therefore, I believe Station Oxford is necessary for the protection of the health and safety of boaters in the area it serves.  A replacement of Station Oxford by Station Annapolis will not adequately protect our boaters and I am concerned it will result in an increase of accidents with more detrimental results due to the prolonged response time.  Station Oxford is necessary to provide security of the public health and safety and emergency assistance.
	Thank you for your consideration.

Dear Admiral Sibley

         In regards to the closing of the Oxford USCG Station I think it would be a mistake to close the station.
The waters around the station are very heavily used by commercial and recreational boaters alike. With the closing
of the oxford station the response times may have devastating consequences as the closest station would be
25 miles away in Annapolis. .
         I have lived in Oxford and surrounding area for most of my life and have boating recreationally since the early
1970's.I ask that you reconsider the closing of the Oxford Station for the safety of boaters in the area.

Re: USCG Oxford Station Closure; Docket Number USCG-2020-0042


Dear Admiral Sibley,

I am a professional mariner and writing to comment on the USCG consideration of closure / consolidation of the Oxford, MD boat station.  While it is certainly true that modern navigation, communication and the performance (speed) of USCG assets has greatly reduced response time, and that general vessel reliability and increased safety standards has reduced incoming calls, it also remains true that accidents and emergencies happen.  No degree of consolidation of boating stations can replace the fast response of a NEARBY and prepared USCG crew.
The mid bay region of the Chesapeake is an expansive body of water.  As you know, the nearest USCG boat stations to Oxford are Crisfield and Annapolis.   Emergencies on the water do not always happen during benign conditions.  No matter how fast and capable a USCG vessel is, it is only as fast as conditions allow.    Responding to an emergency in the mid bay from Annapolis or Crisfield during challenging conditions would be slowed and potentially put lives at risk.
Although Oxford station may not receive as many calls as other regions, they are prepared and standing by....as they should be.  As a professional mariner I am opposed to the closure of the Oxford boat station.   ",,,,,,,

Re: OPPOSE - USCG-2020-0042

Admiral Sibley,

I am writing in strong opposition to USCG-2020-0042, Consolidation of Redundant Coast Guard Boat Stations, proposing the consolidation of U.S. Coast Guard Station Oxford located in Oxford, Maryland (""Station Oxford"").  As I will explain below, the closing of Station Oxford would have a great impact on the Eastern Shore.  I appreciate the opportunity to submit comment in opposition to USCG-2020-0042 and hope that you recognize the impact that consolidating Station Oxford would have on the Town of Oxford and the Eastern Shore. 

I strongly oppose USCG-2020-0042 as I believe the closing of Station Oxford would be detrimental to the safety of boaters on the Eastern Shore.  Station Oxford plays a pivotal role in the safety of boaters along the waterways from northern Tilghman Island to the Little Choptank River on the eastern side of the Chesapeake Bay, and also over to Chesapeake Beach and south to Calvert Cliffs on the western side.  Many jurisdictions within this area do not have fire or police departments with boats capable of responding to an emergency on the water, leaving Station Oxford and the Department of Natural Resources, which is oftentimes otherwise occupied with enforcement activities.  The fire departments that have boats capable of responding to emergencies lack the manpower to operate the boats 24 hours a day and the qualified personnel to make water rescues.  

  Station Oxford provides timely response to any emergency on the water.  If Station Oxford is closed, the next closest station to most of the areas Station Oxford serves is Station Annapolis.  This is a major concern.  Station Annapolis is 32 nautical miles from Oxford, 25 nautical miles from St. Michaels, 45 nautical miles from Solomons, 80 nautical miles from Crisfield, and 48 nautical miles from Cambridge.  In addition to the distance, Station Annapolis requires the responding crew to travel across the entire Chesapeake Bay, which can be treacherous at times and require slower boat speeds, resulting in an increased response time. 

A nearly two-hour response time is concerning.  It is even more concerning when you consider that hypothermia can set in within 45 minutes and the fact that the Eastern Shore is known for waterfowl hunting during the winter months.  Hunters routinely take out large groups on guided boat hunts during the winter.  If a guided tour experienced an emergency on the water, the response time would be crucial to the group's survival.  Relying on a boat from Annapolis, in poor winter weather, could easily result in tragedy.  

	The distance from Station Annapolis to areas that Station Oxford serves is a huge concern for boater safety.   Station Oxford plays a significant role in educating the public on boater safety.  Without the education aspect that Station Oxford offers, the risk to our marine community will greatly increase.  The crew at Station Oxford focuses on maritime safety and protecting the local communities.  The crew spends a lot of time during prime boating season educating boaters by boarding their boat to accomplish that mission.  I am doubtful that the Eastern Shore could expect the same level of presence by Station Annapolis.  If the consolidation occurred, Station Annapolis would be responsible for a much larger area causing their time spent educating boaters to decrease.  It is not realistic to think that a crew from Station Annapolis could be as present on the Eastern Shore as the Station Oxford crew. 

Station Oxford is pivotal in providing the necessary boater education on the water.  The Department of Natural Resources does not have the time to board boats to provide boater safety education.  Without boater education, the number of accidents and emergencies on the water is certain to rise and there will not be a local Coast Guard to respond.  Ultimately, the closure of Station Oxford will cause an increase of emergencies and decreased response time, which is detrimental to the public health and safety. 

	Therefore, I believe Station Oxford is necessary for the protection of the health and safety of boaters in the area it serves.  A replacement of Station Oxford by Station Annapolis will not adequately protect our boaters and I am concerned it will result in an increase of accidents with more detrimental results due to the prolonged response time.  Station Oxford is necessary to provide security of the public health and safety and emergency assistance.
	Thank you for your consideration.

ACTION: Request for comments.

Admiral Sibley,                            				4/10/2020

I am writing to oppose the closing of Coast Guard Station Oxford in 2021 or any time in the future.  

Some Chesapeake Bay/Choptank River figures:

Choptank River:
       Largest River Solely in Maryland on the Chesapeake Bay
       Cambridge,  Maryland's Second Deep Water Port
       Choptank River is one of the major areas for Oyster Harvest in the                                      
             Winter months (emergency requires short response times)       

Coast Guard:  Desired Response time 30-45 minutes
Choptank Light located approx 1 mile West from Coast Guard Sta Oxford

Two Closet CG stations to Choptank River:

CG STA Solomon's:  
       Approx 37 miles to Choptank Light  
        (1.5 miles is in a wake restricted zone)
        Estimated Response times to Choptank Light
               Winds <10kts.....1.5 hrs
                Winds >10k-15 kts.....3-4 Hrs 

CG STA Annapolis:
        Approx 31 Miles to Choptank Light
         (1.3 Miles,  cannot determine if no wake zone)
         Estimated Response times to Choptank Light 
                Winds <10kts.....1- 1.5 hrs
                Winds >10k-15 kts.....2-3 Hrs  

Coast Guard Boats can operate at speeds into the 40 knot range, usually run at 30 knots...I used 30kts calm and less in high wind conditions, thinking that most emergencies happen in bad WX conditions.

My research shows that closing Oxford Station, Oxford Maryland is not a viable option!

If cost cutting is the point, I suggest first addressing the excess stations in a 15km radius in the Norfolk Area.

Any questions, Please call ....410-725-1781

The number of boaters on the Bay has increased significantly over time. In 1990, there was a total 190,436 registered and documented boats on Maryland waters, including trailered power boats, in-water power boats, and sailboats.By 2004, there were 209,706 boats of all types. Of the latter, 90% were power boats, including personal water craft (jet skis). Not all of these boats were in use on the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries; some were on our few large lakes. But probably 80 % are bay boats. 

When you consider the number of possible boating accidents, collisions, capsizings, and engine fires that can occur anytime, anywhere, on the bay, a reduction of our USCG stations and cutters that play such a large role in life-saving rescues and policing maritime boating activity seems an ill-advised policy. The two USCG boat stations in the Mid-Bay area are located near Thomas Point and Oxford, but they have a huge area two cover when you consider the number of rivers flowing into the bay from opposite shores from Baltimore south to Solomons on the Patuxent . Another consideration must be the virtually uncountable number of canoe and kayak enthusiasts who often venture out into unsafe waters from anywhere along the shoreline, you have to factor-in the dangerous situations that can occur on almost daily basis during our long boating season.  

It is essential to retain and maintain the USCG stations that we do have. Their personnel do a wonderful job responding to maritime emergencies of all types that occur on Chesapeake Bay. To reduce the number of stations only increases the area and number of emergency calls for which they will be responsible and may cost additional boaters' lives because of longer response times. Do the right thing and reject the proposal to reduce and consolidate USCG Boat Stations.   William S. Dudley, Easton, MD.

Also, it should be noted that there is a Nuclear Power Plant, and LNG Dock which Oxford is the closest location by water.

If you are not firing the crew, getting rid of the boats, then the money that is being saved, by shutting a owned building on a federal property is minuscule. 

In light of the recent Covid-19, it seems to me that keeping  USCG Stations spread apart, especially to the Eastern Shore with a
rural population makes sense to be able to protect our forces.

This plan puts lives in danger, does not save money, and decreases homeland security.

	Re: Oppose-USCG-2020-0042

Dear Admiral Sibley,

	It is understandable that when confronted with limited resources, as we recognize that the Coast Guard is making efforts to cut costs wherever possible to ensure that the Coast Guard continues to meet its mission in the best manner possible.  But certain cuts, including the elimination of the Oxford Coast Guard station, do harm to the ability of the Guard to protect the lives of the people you serve.

	As we are learning from the Covid-19 pandemic, the costs in lives and to our economy are magnified greatly because we failed to properly maintain a government infrastructure designed to mitigate a relatively small but highly impactful number of threats.

The rationale for closing Oxford station is based, in part, on the assumption that there are other options available that can meet the needs of the Chesapeake boating community from recreational to the variety of commercial operations from fishing to ocean going traffic. 

 I do not believe that rationale is valid.

	Given that the nearest CG station is more than 30 miles away as well as across the bay, the closure of the Oxford Station will mean that there are no viable options for a reasonable response time to vessels and people in distress.   As you know, there are significant distances between Annapolis and St. Michaels (25 nm) Solomons (45nm), Crisfield (80nm) and Cambridge (48nm).    Consequently, there will be extended wait times for response that will sooner or later cause harm.  

	It also is now a reality that there are scenarios in which the Coast Guard could be forced to prioritize responses and proximity to an event will certainly be a factor in who gets needed assistance quickly and who may get none at all.  

	Perhaps the reduced ability of the Coast Guard to respond to those in need would be more tenable if there were other mechanisms in place that could step up to support the hundreds of vessels that cruise along the Eastern Shore.  But local communities have even more limited resources and the Maryland Department of Natural Resources has neither the appropriate vessels nor mission to provide the level of support that is so needed by the communities of the Chesapeake.

	In my more than 30 years of boating on the Eastern Seaboard from New York Harbor to the Florida Keys, I have needed assistance from the Coast Guard twice.  Once I happened to be one mile from Governor's Island in New York Harbor so the assistance was quite rapid and welcomed because it saved my vessel. The second time, 20 years later, was a fire in the Florida Keys and I happened to be almost equidistant between two stations creating a unique understanding of the importance of proximity.  Perhaps 10 miles one way or another would have made the difference between being able to salvage the boat or at it turned out having it become a total loss.   
	Fortunately, no lives were at stake during this emergency and while I did lose my boat in the fire, the education and support from the Coast Guard over the years helped me make sure that after I had done all I could do to combat the fire, I had the proper equipment and knowledge to safely get my wife and myself off of the boat. 

	I appreciate you taking the time to read my  opposition letter and I hope that you will remove Oxford from the list of stations to be closed because such a closure presents a significant opportunity for harm to the  property and people  who have been and should continue to be served by its presence.

If it closes, the nearest station is in Annapolis MD, nearly 2 hour boat ride away with a searchable territory of unmanageable amounts of water and shorelines.  Given those timelines with cold water, the results of slower response times could be deadly.   

Not to mention........Dorchester and Talbot Co have enormous amounts of shorelines.  As long as I can remember, we have heard boats running at night, suspicious boats in the area, and oddly,  drug dealers from the DC/Baltimore/Philly area seem to find their ways here.  Rumors have always abounded of drugs coming in via water through our area.  Regular patrols by the Coast Guard have probably limited that activity to some degree.  Eliminating these patrols and only offering limited police presence by DNR may open up more opportunity for illegal drugs to come through here and flow to the cities.

Oxford USCG is a close and reliable source of help and rescue in times of need to Eastern Shore boaters and watermen.  Please do not close this safety net for us.

Re: OPPOSE - USCG-2020-0042

Admiral Sibley,

I am writing in strong opposition to USCG-2020-0042, Consolidation of Redundant Coast Guard Boat Stations, proposing the consolidation of U.S. Coast Guard Station Oxford located in Oxford, Maryland (""Station Oxford"").  As I will explain below, the closing of Station Oxford would have a great impact on the Eastern Shore.  I appreciate the opportunity to submit comment in opposition to USCG-2020-0042 and hope that you recognize the impact that consolidating Station Oxford would have on the Town of Oxford and the Eastern Shore. 

I strongly oppose USCG-2020-0042 as I believe the closing of Station Oxford would be detrimental to the safety of boaters on the Eastern Shore.  Station Oxford plays a pivotal role in the safety of boaters along the waterways from northern Tilghman Island to the Little Choptank River on the eastern side of the Chesapeake Bay, and also over to Chesapeake Beach and south to Calvert Cliffs on the western side.  Many jurisdictions within this area do not have fire or police departments with boats capable of responding to an emergency on the water, leaving Station Oxford and the Department of Natural Resources, which is oftentimes otherwise occupied with enforcement activities.  The fire departments that have boats capable of responding to emergencies lack the manpower to operate the boats 24 hours a day and the qualified personnel to make water rescues.  

  Station Oxford provides timely response to any emergency on the water.  If Station Oxford is closed, the next closest station to most of the areas Station Oxford serves is Station Annapolis.  This is a major concern.  Station Annapolis is 32 nautical miles from Oxford, 25 nautical miles from St. Michaels, 45 nautical miles from Solomons, 80 nautical miles from Crisfield, and 48 nautical miles from Cambridge.  In addition to the distance, Station Annapolis requires the responding crew to travel across the entire Chesapeake Bay, which can be treacherous at times and require slower boat speeds, resulting in an increased response time. 

A nearly two-hour response time is concerning.  It is even more concerning when you consider that hypothermia can set in within 45 minutes and the fact that the Eastern Shore is known for waterfowl hunting during the winter months.  Hunters routinely take out large groups on guided boat hunts during the winter.  If a guided tour experienced an emergency on the water, the response time would be crucial to the group's survival.  Relying on a boat from Annapolis, in poor winter weather, could easily result in tragedy.  

	The distance from Station Annapolis to areas that Station Oxford serves is a huge concern for boater safety.   Station Oxford plays a significant role in educating the public on boater safety.  Without the education aspect that Station Oxford offers, the risk to our marine community will greatly increase.  The crew at Station Oxford focuses on maritime safety and protecting the local communities.  The crew spends a lot of time during prime boating season educating boaters by boarding their boat to accomplish that mission.  I am doubtful that the Eastern Shore could expect the same level of presence by Station Annapolis.  If the consolidation occurred, Station Annapolis would be responsible for a much larger area causing their time spent educating boaters to decrease.  It is not realistic to think that a crew from Station Annapolis could be as present on the Eastern Shore as the Station Oxford crew. 

Station Oxford is pivotal in providing the necessary boater education on the water.  The Department of Natural Resources does not have the time to board boats to provide boater safety education.  Without boater education, the number of accidents and emergencies on the water is certain to rise and there will not be a local Coast Guard to respond.  Ultimately, the closure of Station Oxford will cause an increase of emergencies and decreased response time, which is detrimental to the public health and safety. 

	Therefore, I believe Station Oxford is necessary for the protection of the health and safety of boaters in the area it serves.  A replacement of Station Oxford by Station Annapolis will not adequately protect our boaters and I am concerned it will result in an increase of accidents with more detrimental results due to the prolonged response time.  Station Oxford is necessary to provide security of the public health and safety and emergency assistance.

	Thank you for your consideration.

I appreciate the opportunity to submit comment in opposition to USCG-2020-0042 and hope that you recognize the impact that consolidating Station Oxford would have on the Town of Oxford and the Eastern Shore. 

Our family are boaters. We have undergone safety checks by the Coast Guard, and appreciate the dedication of the women and men of the Coast Guard in protecting the citizens of the Eastern Shore.  The Choptank / Tred Avon watershed is a mecca for boaters and is oft times featured in national cruising periodicals as a ""Must Go"" destination.  Boaters from the Western Shore need local Coast Guard protection when visiting our waters.  They cannot bring it with them from Annapolis in a timely manner during an emergency.

I strongly oppose USCG-2020-0042 as I believe the closing of Station Oxford would be detrimental to the safety of boaters on the Eastern Shore.  Station Oxford plays a pivotal role in the safety of boaters along the waterways from northern Tilghman Island to the Little Choptank River on the eastern side of the Chesapeake Bay, and also over to Chesapeake Beach and south to Calvert Cliffs on the western side.

He stated that we, as legal residents of the Town of Oxford, strongly oppose the closing of the USCG facility at Oxford.  Among the reasons stated included 1) the Tred Avon area is a congested boating thoroughfare needing constant patrolling, especially due to the large and growing number of rental boats and jet skis; 2) growing heavy 24-hour commercial traffic to and from Easton Point, 3) the cove (Terrapin Cove) surrounding the Marine Lab and USCG facility is a long-time Federally designated federal sanctuary requiring ultimate federal protection; 4) the aforsaid Terrapin Cove is both the only Maryland Terrapin nesting site on the fringes of Oxford; 5) the aforesaid Terrapin Cove is also the location of an ongoing oyster restoration program by Maryland, the USG, and private partnership, such as the CBM, 6) and the area is subject to expensive crabbing in season that requires helping DNR's meager resources to allow lawful harvesting.  There is also the fact that the USCG budget helps to defray the costs of maintaining the dock and other facilities also used by NOAA for federal purposes.  Removing the USCG activities would jeopardize the NOAA Lab and its many marine protection and conservation programs.

Our family owns a home directly on the center of Terrapin Cove.  For 20 years we have observed the activities of the USGG on the Tread Avon River, and beyond.  We know firsthand how constructive a role the USCG plays in the policing and environmental protection of that watershed.  Myself and our two sons, one of whom interned in the NOAA marine mammals protection program some years ago, strongly support maintaining the USCG presence at the Oxford Marine Laboratory.

The removal of the USCG presence at the Oxford marine Lab would be penny-wise and pound foolish.

I am a citizen of Talbot County, Maryland and I strongly object to the closing of the U.S. Coast Guard station in Oxford, MD. This is a very unwise, unsafe, and potentially disastrous policy decision that will undoubtedly and unnecessarily put lives at risk.

Station Oxford plays a pivotal role in the safety of boaters along the waterways from northern Tilghman Island to the Little Choptank River on the eastern side of the Chesapeake Bay, and also over to Chesapeake Beach and south to Calvert Cliffs on the western side. If Station Oxford is closed, the next closest station is Station Annapolis. Not only is Station Annapolis 32 nautical miles from Oxford, it also requires the travel across the entire Chesapeake Bay, which can be treacherous at times and require slower boat speeds, increasing the response time. In fact, some locations Station Oxford protects are over two hours away from Station Annapolis. We should not have to explain to the U.S. Coast Guard that every second counts in maritime rescues.

Many jurisdictions within this area do not have fire or police departments with boats capable of responding to an emergency on the water, leaving Station Oxford and the Department of Natural Resources, which is oftentimes otherwise occupied with enforcement activities. The jurisdictions with fire departments that do have boats capable of responding to emergencies lack the manpower to operate the boats 24 hours a day and also lack the qualified personnel to make water rescues.

I echo the concerns of the Town of Oxford in this concerning matter. Although emergency response is the largest benefit Station Oxford brings to the community, it contributes much more. Station Oxford plays a significant role in educating the public on boater safety. We strongly feel that without the education aspect that Station Oxford offers, the risk to our marine community will greatly increase. The crew at Station Oxford focuses on maritime safety and protecting the local communities. The crew spends a lot of time during prime boating season educating boaters by boarding their boat to accomplish that mission.

As an example, over Memorial Day weekend in 2019, Station Oxford conducted 44 recreational boater safety boardings to promote the message of boating safety. The Coast Guard is the only agency that provides the necessary boater education. The Department of Natural Resources does not have the time to board boats for the sole purpose of providing boater safety education. We believe that the education Station Oxford provides directly correlates to the limited number of emergencies on the water. Without the education, the number of accidents and emergencies on the water will likely increase and there will not be a local Coast Guard to respond.

Ultimately, the closure of Station Oxford will cause an increase of emergencies and decreased response time, which is detrimental to the public health and safety.

Aside from the safety Station Oxford provides on the water, it also provides security to the area where it is located. Station Oxford shares a campus with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (""NOAA"") and the Maryland Department of Natural Resources (""DNR"") at the end of South Morris Street called the ""Cooperative Oxford Laboratory."" Unlike NOAA and DNR, Station Oxford is manned 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. During major weather events and similar emergencies, Station Oxford monitors the NOAA lab and DNR site and provides updates to the employees that work at both locations so that they may respond to the location if an emergency arises.

A reckless decision here puts lives at risk. Station Oxford is a critical piece of Oxford's, and the entire Eastern Shore of Maryland's, infrastructure and I implore you to look elsewhere for additional funding resources. Thank you for your consideration of my opposition to the shuttering of Station Oxford.",,,,,,,

It is a well known and appropriate allegory that perception is reality, and safety is paramount. The Chesapeake Bay has long been recognized as a unique environment with its own sub-climate, geography, and inherent marine challenges. The Port of Baltimore is now recognized as the busiest port on the East Coast, the Bay Bridge brings interesting and challenging dynamics to the mid bay almost every day, and just a bit further south is the NATC Patuxent River complex that uses the airspace over the bay as well as surface and subsurface areas for naval aviation flight and weapons testing with those associated perils. Distance measuring between USCG stations to approximate a area of SAR coverage does not appear to be reasonable given the intricate geography of the bay and its tributaries. Annapolis is a well known mecca for sailing and boating, but the eastern shore is just as popular but more spread out with more diverse and obscure niches of maritime recreation and commerce. USCG STA OXFORD is intrinsically familiar with its area of operation and provides education, oversight, and safety to the citizens of the eastern shore of Maryland that has become reality!

CBMM appreciates the opportunity to submit comment in opposition to USCG-2020-0042, and implores that you consider the impact that USCG-2020-0042 would have on the Eastern Shore.

CBMM believes the closure decision would be detrimental to all Eastern Shore residents, and the safety of CBMM's own on-the-water programming. A nearby Coast Guard station means greater safety on the water. Since CBMM operates vessels with thousands of museum guests and K-12 school children on field trips on waters near this Coast Guard station, safety is diminished if Oxford Station is closed, and the next nearest station has a longer run to reach us.

Currently, the next closest station is Annapolis. When CBMM operates on the Miles River, the Annapolis and Oxford stations are roughly equidistant. But response times from Annapolis are much slower if the Bay crossing is dangerous. 

When CBMM is operating on the Choptank, such as during the Oxford log canoe races or the Cambridge skipjack race, the Coast Guard in Annapolis will have a much longer response time. We have often seen Station Oxford visibly present for the Oxford regatta, and we appreciate them--and we have repeatedly said so to the young Coasties. Their visible presence tempers the behavior of other boaters.

CBMM appreciates your consideration of this opposition to the consolidation of Station Oxford. CBMM hopes that the very serious issue of boater safety--for people of all ages--will cause you to reconsider the the consolidation of Oxford Station. Closure of Oxford Station would be extremely detrimental to the health and safety of the entire marine community on the Eastern Shore, and particularly the public programming offered by CBMM, which is essential to CBMM's mission.

The Eastern Shore is a vast geographic region that includes the waterways of the Chesapeake Bay, Choptank River, and Little Choptank River.  Economically, the area and its waterways form one of the most critical seafood harvesting grounds in the state.  In its large geographic jurisdiction are the active Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant as well as the Cove Point Liquefied Natural Gas export facility, two key national security assets.  Moreover, these waters are part of the Intracoastal Waterway that vessels use for transit along the length of the East Coast of the continental United States.  Thousands of watermen work and travel along the waterways, even in cold water and inclement weather.  The individuals who work in this and other industries on the water will at times require assistance in a time of emergency.

Station Oxford is all the more essential for meeting the unique security and safety needs of the Eastern Shore given that it is the only U.S. Coast Guard facility in this extensive region.  Manned by approximately 20 U.S. Coast Guard personnel, Station Oxford provides critical emergency response in a timely manner that is not likely to be maintained if it were to close.  Indeed, many of the public safety agencies in the area simply do not have the boats and other resources necessary for responding to emergencies on the waterways.  There is no alternative facility that can meet the needs of the Eastern Shore.  Station Annapolis, which in the case of Station Oxford closing, would become the closest facility.  Occupying a more northerly geographic position, that facility would not be able to respond to more southerly areas in the same amount of time.

Two other government agencies share the site with the U.S. Coast Guard: (1) the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Centers for Coastal Ocean Service's (NCCOS) Cooperative Oxford Laboratory and (2) Maryland's Department of Natural Resources (DNR).  This cohabitation of three agencies on one site has created longstanding partnerships while also allowing for greater utilization of the unique resources of the U.S. Coast Guard by state and local entities.  Yet while both NOAA and DNR also provide important functions, they cannot be a substitute for Station Oxford, whose public servants stand ready to respond to emergencies 24/7 all year round.  Their commitment to serving the needs of the Eastern Shore was only underscored when, during the 35-day federal government shutdown of 2018-2019, the men and women of Station Oxford continued to work even as they went unpaid and the NOAA and DNR facilities were vacant.

We thank you for taking the time to consider our public comment and hope that you can recognize the merits of our argument.  Station Oxford is a critical resource that can help save lives in the Eastern Shore.  It should remain in operation.",,,,,,"https://downloads.regulations.gov/USCG-2020-0042-0094/attachment_1.pdf",

I have run the local marine towing and salvage company in the area for the past 30 years and work with the CG and other agencies closely. The ETA  from Annapolis to respond to an emergency in the Oxford, Cambridge or the Denton area would be far too long.  Their absence would put more pressure on our local volunteer fire departments and DNR assets. If CG Annapolis were to send a boat by land and launch in one of these areas, they would have to contend with the bridge traffic.  Is it more cost-effective for a helo to cover the area? There are many local events where CG Oxford is there to control boating traffic and assist with other issues.
We are a community that works together with all of our assets, closing Station Oxford would be removing one of our greatest assets in the safety of our boating community. ",,,,,,,

I believe the closing of Station Oxford would be detrimental to the safety of our citizens and the boaters in our response area and on the Eastern Shore.

Station Oxford provides timely response to significant emergencies on the water.  If Station Oxford is closed, the next closest station to most of the areas Station Oxford serves is Station Annapolis and we would be hindered with a significant response time.
Although Station Oxford does not respond to our routine local marine emergencies, knowing that they are available to back us up is a significant factor in our safety strategy and our citizens knowing they are nearby is a contributing factor influencing our economy.
Their Federal presence deters the potential for drug trafficking within our many small waterways.
Station Oxford is pivotal in providing necessary boater education and oversight on our waters and reinforces our local Department of Natural Resources operations. 

Closing Station Oxford will place additional pressure on our limited local emergency services and resources to protect our region during a significant marine emergency.
If anything, OVFC would like to develop a much more routine working relationship with Station Oxford as we are struggling with minimal personnel and outdated marine resources.

Especially in light of our ongoing pandemic we ask that you maintain the existing Federal presence, manning, emergency assistance, and protections offered to the public health and safety on the Eastern Shore by USCG Station Oxford.

Dear Admiral Schultz and Rear Admiral Sibley,

I am writing to urge you to withdraw the proposal to close the U.S. Coast Guard Station (small) Shark River located in Avon-by-the-Sea in my congressional district (NJ-04). Given the history and safety implications of this station, I am also requesting a meeting with you and your appropriate designees, as well as informed local stakeholders, to discuss this ill-conceived plan which has been proposed and rejected, with good reason, in the past.

As you are aware, in October of 2017 the Government Accountability Office (GAO) issued report GAO-18-9, titled Actions Needed to Close Stations Identified as Overlapping and Unnecessarily Duplicative. Within this report, the GAO recommended 18 boat stations be identified for consolidation and anticipated the consolidation of five stations--including Shark River station--be ""notionally"" implemented for fiscal year 2021. 

Each station has different circumstances.  Yet, there is little doubt that closing the Shark River station poses a serious threat to the safety of all who are on the water in-and-around Shark River, including commercial and recreational boaters, fishermen, athletes, and tourists.  The station is strategically located--and has been for over a century--300 yards inside the mouth of the Shark River Inlet in Avon.  The station covers a 25-mile stretch along the Monmouth County shore and is pivotal to the mission of preventing the loss of life, injury, and property, especially since time, in these matters, is always essential.   

The Shark River station is an optimal location for successful implementation of the U.S. Coast Guard's search and rescue (SAR) mission  in this very busy waterway.  The high volume of maritime activity in-and-out of the Shark River Inlet in the busy summer months and the crowds at the many perennially popular public beaches warrant a station closer than Manasquan Inlet and Sandy Hook to safeguard citizens from the constant danger of boating accidents and rip currents at the Jersey Shore. According to page 51 of the GAO report , between Fiscal Year 2010-2016, there were 47 SAR cases involving Shark River station, alone.  Those who live, work and recreate on the Shark River, underscore the importance of time in each of these cases and point out that closing the Shark River Station would jeopardize the mission of the U.S. Coast guard, and risk the safety of all who live and visit the northern Jersey Shore. 

I am aware that in 2007 and approximately 1997, U.S. Coast Guard attempted to seasonalize the station, closing it during the winter months.  Each time, the plan was ultimately withdrawn, underscoring the shortsightedness then, and even more so now.  Today, just as in 1997 and 2007, angler, boaters and water enthusiasts continue to require the protection offered by Station Shark River. It is imperative for the U.S. Coast Guard Shark River Station to be fully operationally with SAR mission capabilities 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year. 

To ensure the safety of my constituents and all who visit the beautiful waters of the Jersey Shore--especially the Shark River area--I strongly encourage you to reconsider, and reject, this unnecessary and dangerous proposal. Additionally, I respectfully request that no final decision be made while the our Nation is observing stay-at-home orders due to the coronavirus pandemic and until leaders in and around the Shark River have had a chance to meet with you and your staff to discuss this critical matter.  

I appreciate your time and consideration. To identify a mutually convenient time for us to meet, please have your appropriate staff contact me or my legislative assistant Christopher Hansell at 202-225-3765 (Christopher.hansell@mail.house.gov).

Sincerely,

(""Station Oxford"").  We live on Tar Creek in Royal Oak, Maryland.  The town of Oxford can be seen from our dock.  We engage in recreational boating on the Tred Avon and Choptank Rivers.  Occasionally, we also venture into the Chesapeake Bay to go to the western shore or to the Miles River.  We ask that you consider the adverse impact that USCG-2020-0042 would have on boaters like us.

	Any decision to close the Oxford station would be detrimental to boaters in the Easton, Oxford, Cambridge, St. Michaels and Tilghman Island areas.  A nearby Coast Guard station means greater safety on the water.  In addition to coming to the aid of boaters, we have often seen the Oxford Station pull over boaters engaging in unsafe practices (e.g., kids on the bow while underway, following too closely, too many people on the boat) and in some cases, boating ""under the influence.""  Many of these activities by the Oxford Station are preventative.  Safety is diminished if Oxford Station is closed, and the next nearest station has a longer run to reach us and only comes once an accident has occurred.  Moreover, the visible presence of the Oxford Station tempers the behavior of other boaters.

	Currently, the next closest station is Annapolis.  When boating on the Tred Avon or on the Choptank, the Coast Guard in Annapolis will have a much longer response time.  The preventative activities now undertaken by the Oxford Station will be basically nonexistent.  The response times from Annapolis will be even longer if the Bay crossing is dangerous.

	We appreciate your consideration of this opposition to the consolidation of Station Oxford.  We hope that the very serious issue of boater safety--for people of all ages--will cause you to reconsider the consolidation of Oxford Station.  Closure of Oxford Station would be extremely detrimental to the health and safety of the entire marine community on the Eastern Shore, and particularly those on the Tred Avon and Choptank Rivers.

Thus we sail in waters where coverage by the Coast Guard station at Oxford affords greater security than the station at Annapolis.  In addition, CRYCC sponsors one of the Log Canoe races usually held in Langford Bay which may be more easily accessible in an emergency than from the station in Annapolis.  Consequently we oppose closing of the station in Oxford as it is detrimental to eastern shore residents and the safety of CRYCC activities.

CBMM believes the closure decision would be detrimental to all Eastern Shore residents, and the safety of CBMM's own on-the-water programming. A nearby Coast Guard station means greater safety on the water. Since CBMM operates vessels with thousands of museum guests and K-12 school children on field trips on waters near this Coast Guard station, safety is diminished if Oxford Station is closed, and the next nearest station has a longer run to reach us.

Currently, the next closest station is Annapolis. When CBMM operates on the Miles River, the Annapolis and Oxford stations are roughly equidistant. But response times from Annapolis are much slower if the Bay crossing is dangerous.

When CBMM is operating on the Choptank, such as during the Oxford log canoe races or the Cambridge skipjack race, the Coast Guard in Annapolis will have a much longer response time. We have often seen Station Oxford visibly present for the Oxford regatta, and we appreciate them--and we have repeatedly said so to the young Coasties. Their visible presence tempers the behavior of other boaters.

CBMM appreciates your consideration of this opposition to the consolidation of Station Oxford. CBMM hopes that the very serious issue of boater safety--for people of all ages--will cause you to reconsider the consolidation of Oxford Station.

As someone who was born on the Eastern Shore of Maryland, grew up commercial crabbing for my first job, and a regular boater on the waters of the bay, Oxford Station is of the utmost importance for responding to the very popular waters of the Tred Avon, Choptank, and the rest of the Eastern Shore. This area is one of the most popular destinations on the Bay for recreational boating, is home to thousands of working watermen, many of whom don't know how to swim, and is a place where people live and breath life on the water. Schools regularly have field trips to Poplar island and on boats down in this area, and I can't imagine anyone but the USCG responding with adequate resources. 

Keeping people living and breathing is important, and the response capabilities of local municipalities are not up to the task of adequately responding to calls for help. Only the USCG has the full level of training, experience, coordination abilities, etc to deal with the amount of need in this area, and response time is critical when dealing with marine accidents.

I regularly spend time sailing and fishing in these waters, and cannot imagine not having the presence of Oxford Station.",,,,,,,

I appreciate the opportunity to submit comments in opposition to USCG-2020-0042, and implore that you consider the impact that USCG-2020-0042 would have on the Eastern Shore.

As the Director of Education at the Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum in St. MIchaels, MD, I oversee programming that puts PK-12 school children, families, and adult museum guests on the water. While safety is a top priority for our programming and in the operation of our vessels, one of my greatest fears is the need to call in advanced support. A nearby Coast Guard station means greater safety on the water. The closure of the Oxford Station directly impacts the safety of our rivers and local boating communities, as in the event of an incident, the next nearest station has a longer run to reach us.

Further, as an active member in the Chesapeake Bay sailboat racing community, I have personally experienced the impact of the Coast Guard presence on the Eastern Shore. Our traditional boats are very tender and susceptible to wake from other boats; despite an abundance of safety precautions on the part of our skippers and fleet, we have little ability to control other recreational boaters who can--and have--put other boaters on the river at risk. The presence of the Coast Guard has a dramatically positive impact on protecting our fleet.

Currently, the next closest station is Annapolis. When CBMM operates on the Miles River, the Annapolis and Oxford stations are roughly equidistant. But response times from Annapolis are much slower if the Bay crossing is dangerous. When CBMM is operating on the Choptank, such as during the Oxford log canoe races or the Cambridge skipjack race, the Coast Guard in Annapolis will have a much longer response time. We have often seen Station Oxford visibly present for the Oxford regatta, and we appreciate them--and we have repeatedly said so to the young Coasties. Their visible presence tempers the behavior of other boaters.

I appreciates your consideration of this opposition to the consolidation of Station Oxford, and hope that the very serious issue of boater safety--for people of all ages--will cause you to reconsider the consolidation of Oxford Station. Closure of Oxford Station would be extremely detrimental to the health and safety of the entire marine community on the Eastern Shore, and particularly the public programming offered by CBMM, which is essential to CBMM's mission.",,,,,,,

The Coast Guard, within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), is charged with preventing loss of life, injury and property damage in the maritime environment through its search and rescue mission.  The operations and maintenance of a vast network of boat stations with various assets, along the United States coasts and inland waterways are a testament to carrying out this mission and those of maritime security. 

Although each station is deemed important by various groups of citizens and local officials, resource limitations and changes to operations require the Coast Guard to periodically reexamine the need for these stations.  That is what was done in this case that identified five stations for future closure or modification. 

The need for stations at particular locations has generally decreased over the years with changes in boating activity, boating equipment, and the capabilities of other search and rescue providers such as local police, sheriff, fire departments or other first responders.  However, these entities may not match the many physical responsibilities and duties of the members of the Coast Guard. 

Today and in the past, action at Coast Guard stations has availed the services of adjacent stations when called upon to proceed to render assistance or at least keep in readiness to respond promptly to any subsequent call or be a lookout in the immediate area under distress.   Changes to Coast Guard operations, such as additional mission requirements to address emerging security issues, capabilities and resource limitations allows for the Coast Guard to periodically review the allocation of these resources, including those directed toward boat stations to ensure that they are positioned to meet the Coast Guard's current missions while not unnecessarily duplicating efforts.  This has been done through audit and inspection which identified boat stations for closure. 

This appears to be a sound process for analyzing the need for the Coast Guard boat stations and action should be taken to implement the process results.  The established evaluation design practices and internal control standards can also be used to determine reopening such boat stations, if needed, in the future. ",,,,,,,

A well-needed necessity. The main channel and the Bagnel Dam are popular spots. While the language in the provision thus far covers a wide range of what, when, and who, in the sentences, ""The zone is intended to ensure the safety of persons, vessels, and these navigable waters before, during, and after the scheduled 9:30 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. fireworks display. No vessel or person would be permitted to enter the safety zone without obtaining permission from the COTP or a designated representative,"" could be reviewed. Is ""vessels"" only in relation to boats, or vessels meant for floating atop the water? Does the ""navigable waters"" only apply that of the main channel and water in the surround area of the damn, or also the water that flows through the damn and to the other side? Would the safety zone extend past and through the Bagnel dam? People tend to also gather on or around the Bagnel Dam due to the tourist attraction of shopping strip located just before the damn and could potentially be considered a safety zone. It is appropriate and necessary to discuss first amendment rights as many people will be affected by this provision and getting permission to cross as an average person may pose hardships. All things considered, safety in a very dangerous area during a busy season is not a bad idea. The proposed Informational broadcasts that will inform the public of the enforcement date and times for this safety zone, as well as any emergent safety concerns that may delay the enforcement of the zone through Local Notices to Mariners (LNM) will help the transition of this safety provision into the lives of those who live in the area, boaters, and vacationers.

If the Zone were not instated, the fireworks could potentially harm those who are too close to the area where they are being set off. Additionally, I feel that a Safety Zone would cut down on the amount of people that would attempt to be too close to the firework site. 
This Zone might aid in water security and the safety of everyone involved in the fireworks. Additionally, I feel that this Zone would protect the individuals who are in charge of the fireworks. They would not have to worry about anyone becoming too close to their display, as the Zone would be in place. The Zone makes sense in this instance. ",,,,,,,

Dear Planners:

I am writing a comment regarding the proposed rule to issue a Special Local Regulation for the Sail Grand Prix 2020 Race Event; San Francisco, CA (USCG-2020-0078-0001). Due to the current situation of the COVID-19 virus  pandemic that takes place in the United States, I would like to know if this will affect the promulgation of these regulations. California is on lock down situation as well as the entire nation and most of the world. Therefore, it is highly unlikely this event will occur. The World Health Organization declared it as a pandemic and the people to social distance themselves and to self-quarantine at home until the virus threat has passed. However, if the Sail Grand Prix 2020 Race Event Regatta is held the main concern for writing this comment is the safety for the public in the event. The other concerns would be how they will minimize the control issue of terrorism or violent attempts, such as will there be any security check points so people with weapons would be minimized and where would 20,000 people park and who would be providing the food and beverages, is alcohol going to be served for the event? because it could lead to physical alterations. There will need to have to have a clear access to police, fire, and medical assistance and ambulance in the event of an incident. The accountability and logistics for distribution and security of the funds the collecting of the ticket fee to watch the event as well as selling food and alcohol, they would need to have permits for the alcohol and food. Lastly is the issue of the residents who dispute this event and wants access to the water which is a health and safety concern. In addition, may concerns are with the supporting documents on file which I have listed below.
 
	Regarding the document on file: DHS National Environmental Policy Act Record of Environmental Consideration for Categorically Excluded Actions an issue was raised by BCDC during the 2019 event regarding an incidental impact to waterfront users , I agree with this document in closing off all access from the waterfront area directly to everyone in front of Yacht Road through-traffic is possible prevent citizens the same mistakes and individuals from getting injuries. Also, I agree with this change making this area a no loitering zones along the San Francisco Waterfront to the east and west of Yacht Road in San Francisco, CA. 

	Regarding the document on file: DHS National Environmental Policy Act Record of Environmental Consideration for Categorically Excluded Actions: I would recommend  all recreational owners of water vehicles hanging around period should be banned from the event. Therefore, I disagree with this ""This closure will not affect vessel entry to or exit from marinas, piers, or parks located east or west of Yacht Road in San Francisco, CA, so recreational boaters will still be able to launch their watercraft to enjoy the Bay. Commercial vessels will be notified of the closure to through-traffic in advance, so they'll be able to plan to transit around the northern edge of the regulated area"".  Please consider blocking the access to the public in this area until the event is concluded.  

	Regarding the document on file Chart Graphic_SailGP20_NPRM is it possible to block access Zone C1 West- Spectator Area and have the public access only C! East

	 My main concern is that In the past two years, the hours for the previous Regattas start was earlier from 10-3pm and this time allowed was adequate. Perhaps if this event starts earlier it could have a conclusion earlier at 3pm instead of 5:30 pm making the local residents happier and they would stay away from the event until the conclusion. There were nine local residents who also commented about the time ending by 3pm so I wanted to suggest a recommendation for the Regatta ending at 3pm. my recommendation is if this event started earlier and the warm up time is reduced to 30- 45 min perhaps the event can conclude earlier by 3pm. 
	Another recommendation is if this event finished even earlier with an earlier start time such as 10-1pm than food, beverages and alcohol at the event would be moot. There would not be the need for food to be served.



Thank you for your time and effort in reading my letter, I hope that my recommendations would be considered. Thank you the opportunity to comment. Please add my name to your mailing list so that, I can be active of this project.




Sincerely,


Ednalyn Kishida

We'd like to express our support for the proposed changes aimed at expediting public notification of recurring maritime events and ensuring the protection of the public and event participants from potential safety hazards.

Our group appreciates the Coast Guard's effort to reduce administrative costs and bureaucracy. Given our group's support for this proposed regulation, we want to make sure the Coast Guard has the required legal authority to enact the proposed change. Specifically, we are concerned about whether the Coast Guard's proposed changes adhere to the ""hard look"" standard the Supreme Court set forth in Citizens to Preserve Overton Park v. Volpe. 

The Coast Guard stated that it derives its authority to enact this proposed rule from 46 U.S.C. 70034. Under the statute, the ""Secretary shall consult with, and receive and consider the views of all interested persons..."" While the effects of these proposed changes appear positive, we want to ensure that the interests of the parties who will be affected have been adequately considered, including the organizers of the events around the Long Island Sound. 

Additionally, under ""Section IV(B): Impact on Small Entities,"" the Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that the proposed rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The statute states that an agency can avoid the extensive analysis required by section 602, 603, or 604 of the same statute if ""the head of the agency certifies that the rule will not...have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.""

The Coast Guard is likely operating under the appropriate authority, but our group's main concern is to ensure that the Coast Guard is operating within the rules of the APA and has fully considered the relevant outside interests and impacts on small businesses before invoking 5 U.S.C 605(b). As stated in Overton Park, a court ""must consider whether the decision was based on a consideration of the relevant factors and whether there has been a clear error of judgment. Thus, a court may require a more in-depth analysis than just the agency's proclamation that there will be no significant economic impact on small entities.  While the plain language of the statute may not seem to require any additional analysis, we are concerned that the rule will not pass a court's review under the APA's ""arbitrary and capricious"" standard. 

Our group wants to ensure that the agency will be able to competently address the factors considered for the agency's proclamation. We are therefore requesting a formal publication of the factors considered.

Dear Megan,

1. The meeting should consider a Model Course in Vessel Quarantine and Dock/Port Quarantine.
2. Also, pursuant to the Compact of Free Association and the extension of the economic aid package, the meeting should consider requesting the USCG Inspector General, and the GAO or Comptroller General to report on implementation of:""Section 342""The Government of the United States shall have enrolled, at any one time, at least one qualified student from Palau as may be nominated by the Government of Palau, in each of:""(a) The United States Coast Guard Academy pursuant to14 U.S.C. 195[now14 U.S.C. 1923]; and""(b) The United States Merchant Marine Academy pursuant to [former] 46 U.S.C. [App.] 1295b(b)(6) [see46 U.S.C. 51304], provided that the provisions of 46 U.S.C. [App.] 1295b(b)(6)(C) [now46 U.S.C. 51304(b)(2)] shall not apply to the enrollment of students pursuant to Section 342(b) of this Compact.3. Also, the Meeting should invite participation of Palau, Tuvalu and Kiribati in respect of fulfilling the theirnational requirements under Presidential Determination No. 2002-09 of March 12, 2002Eligibility of Palau, Kiribati, and Tuvalu to Receive DefenseArticles and Services Under the Foreign Assistance Act andthe Arms Export Control ActMemorandum for the Secretary of State
Pursuant to the authority vested in me by section 503(a) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, and section 3(a)(1) of the Arms ExportControl Act, I hereby find that the furnishing of defense articles and services to the Governments of Palau, Kiribati, and Tuvalu will strengthen thesecurity of the United States and promote world peace.You are authorized and directed to report this finding to the Congress andto publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.GEORGE W. BUSHTHE WHITE HOUSE,Washington, March 12, 2002.4. And the meeting should ensure compliance with the LEP rules and the spirit of 25 USC 2902 and 2904, providing for conference interpretation in appropriate First Languages.5. We would like to request two minutes to address the meeting pursuant to the Public Notice (During the April 8, 2020 teleconference, a public comment period will be held from approximately 2-2:15 p.m.). We will provide simultaneous interpretation as may be needed.6. We hope the meeting will consider the status of Formosa and the Pescadores and the Spratley and Paracels. Previously the Secretary of State noted that the US have residual responsibilities under the Peace Treaty with Japan and perhaps the SEATO Treaty:https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1955-57v03/d186.During the discussion, the Secretary pointed out that we might consider acting under the Japanese Treaty since the U.S. has residual responsibility over all former Japanese territories. He also expressed the tentative view that we could act unilaterally under Article VIII of theSEATOtreaty.3Various other possibilities were discussed, including[Page 379]the suggestion that we might get the Philippines to act jointly with us. The Secretary rejected the suggestion of consultation with otherSEATOpowers on the ground that quick action was needed and the only way to get it was for the United States to act and take the responsibility for acting.He agreed, however, that nothing could be done until the facts has been ascertained from the reconnaissance aircraft from the Seventh Fleet and that meanwhile various possibilities for prompt and effective action should be explored.7. Since the Treaty is the supreme Law of the Land, we hope the meeting will consider those aspects of our merchant marine human capital development in light of 22 CFR 120.13: ""any territory or possession over which the United States exercises any powers of administration, legislation, and jurisdiction"", 22 USC 619, 18 USC 3185, and the various statutes and CFRs defining waters of the United States.Respectfully,
Dr. Paul Maas RisenhooverRobin Hood International Human Rights Legal Defense FundTainan, FORMOSA, island of Taiwan

First President Trump comes up with some crackpot theory, e.g. that a hurricane will hit Alabama. When questioned Trump doubles down, lashing out at the media and cherry picking evidence -- or in this case clumsily marking up a weather map with a Sharpie. Then his staff twists themselves into knots coming up with any possible rationale. And anyone that doesn't get on board is bullied and punished.

So now it's the Covid-19 pandemic, and Trump's crackpot theory is: ""HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE & AZITHROMYCIN, taken together, have a real chance to be one of the biggest game changers in the history of medicine!"" Federal agencies like HHS and the FDA were told to get on board, despite the lack of supporting evidence. And those who didn't? C'mon, you know that. When Dr. Rick Bright argued for focusing on ""vetted solutions"" rather than unproven drugs, he was removed from his position as director of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority.

Less time and money will need to be spent to reach the end result. However, this is a deregulatory statement which returns responsibility back to the manufacturers to certify that the survival craft equipment they produce meets the appropriate criteria. This can be a dangerous game since without the Coast Guard spot checking the equipment the manufacturers produce, the quality of survival craft equipment has the potential to decrease as the tolerances for mistakes will likely widen. If it is highly likely that manufacturers will regulate themselves accordingly then this rule could work, but as we look at precedents set throughout history that is rarely the case. Based on that I would not withdrawal the Coast Guard type approval requirements in order to air on the side of caution. ",,,,,,,

The ISO requirements proposed for the first aid kits are ambiguous.  Other countries, such as Canada, Australia, United Kingdom (UK), and New Zealand  precisely define the contents of their lifeboat/raft first aid kit. (See Attachment 1 for comparison of lifeboat/life raft kits from these jurisdictions, as well as current USCG, and ISO.)  This includes the number of each component and the size or dosage.  Without clear specifications, the proposed US lifeboat/life raft first aid kit contents will likely vary from manufacturer to manufacturer.   For example, consider “bandage in assorted sizes”.   This nomenclature can lead to the inclusion of mostly bandages which are the least expensive, with one or two of another size. Not only should the dimensions be specified, but the type of bandage and material.    Similar ambiguities are presented for every first aid supply in the ISO requirements.  Specifics need to be provided for the ingested drug, topical products, and length and width of bandages, compression bandage, gauze compress, and triangular bandage so the kits will be standardized.
 
With the need for clearly defined kit contents, we are proposing the components in Table 1 be considered for the US lifeboat/life raft first aid kit contents.    The contents were based on a comparison of other kits (Attachment 1) and our knowledge of marine and USCG first aid kits. 

The integrity of the first aid kit contents is important.  Contents should be kept dry and protected until they are needed.   The primary means of protecting the kit contents is the case.  The kit’s case should withstand the expected conditions it may encounter.  Currently, all approved USCG life rafts use the same soft pliable plastic first aid kit pouch.  The pouch was approved by the USCG.    Use of rigid cases is a concern.  The use of polypropylene cases is unacceptable due to their propensity to crack and shatter. The ability of other types of plastic cases, such as high impact polystyrene (HIPS) and acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), may also pose a broken plastic risk, as well as potentially damaging a life raft.   ISO 18813:2006 (E) 4.1 states “The use of rigid plastic cases which can shatter and create sharp or pointed edges shall be avoided.""

We propose the use of the currently USCG approved watertight soft plastic pouch for all life vessel first aid kits, not just the life rafts.  In addition to being flexible for easy storage on a vessel, the pouch is proven to be watertight (46 USC 160.054-5b ), resist salt spray damage (46 USC 160.054-5a), tolerate temperature extremes (LSA Code 5.17.3), and pass drop testing (46 USC 160.051-5(e)(2).  The testing conducted ensures first aid kit contents will be protected for those situations the pouch may encounter.  All pouches intended for lifeboat/ life raft first aid kit use should meet the same testing requirements for being watertight, salt spray tolerant, and pass drop testing and be able to withstand temperature extremes.

Using the pouch to hold the kit contents can offer the flexibility of having more pouches on larger lifeboats/ life rafts to accommodate the potential first aid needs of more people.   A single pouch contents (as shown in TABLE 1) is sufficient for 25 people.  For larger survival craft, a pouch needs to be added for every 25 people.  Example:  Lifeboat for 26 – 50 people, 2 pouches.  This helps keep costs lower for smaller life rafts yet provides sufficient supplies for larger survival craft.
In addition to the outer first aid pouch providing protection, the components within the kit must be further protected, by being individually wrapped and sealed in plastic.  This allows the kit to be opened during wet conditions and the contents remain protected from water as specified in ISO 18813:2006(E) A.2.7.1.

We have been in marine tour operations for over 15 years now and have a well organized - 'tried and true' - method for documenting our captain & crew policies, training policies and USCG compliance. The proposed rule, to me, is very vague: it ""could include"" a lot of things and, with no tangible examples provided of what new documentation could look like, it's hard for me to understand how that would impact my business and how much annual work it would add to the already incredibly detailed-oriented process that is annual and 5-year inspections. 

My suggestion to you is this: ask your local inspectors for real life tangible examples. Put another way, can they provide you with case studies, real on the ground examples, of companies they feel are doing it right, e.g. have clearly stated safety procedures, staff policies, etc. Our local inspector in USCG sector Juneau deals with every single tourism company (and there are MANY), and I know he could rattle off for you who is organized and who isn't. Organization says a lot right off the bat about who has true safety follow-through and follow-up. I also expect many companies would be willing to provide proprietary examples of their procedures (be it required training hours or accident report procedures & formatting, or paperwork organization - whatever), should he ask for them.

1.  All vessel operators should have some type of SMS, Crew Training Manual, and be actively involved in training their crews in safety and security.  The local Sector Marine Inspection Offices nationwide know which operators are Maritime Professionals and which operations are trying to skate by under the radar.  The resident Inspectors really know the vessel operators in their zones.  They do get stretched to thin at times though.  That's your problem to fix.  Beef up the staff in Marine Inspection at every Sector.  They do a fabulous job.

2.  We always are looking at how to become better at what we do.  These improvements are implemented when we see them, and all crew all trained in new and improved procedures.  Our local inspectors see us annually and know the strides we take to be professional.  There is always a benefit to becoming better at what you do.

3.  There is no silo-ing in our Company.  We have multiple vessels and internal control measures in place.  The best thing is to have all crew on all vessels share experiences with management present taking notes  I remember when the PTP Program was put into place.  The answer was simple Prevention Through People.  The key to success though relies on the People segment.  ""The People involved must be Professional"" and They must truly care about what they are doing.  The local Marine Inspection Teams know those operators that care and those that are just trying the skate by under the radar.  The local Marine Inspection Teams can easily rate every operator in their zone. A, B, C, D, and Absolute Failure.

4.   Communication

5.  Don't bog something done that is best handled by the Operators themselves.

6.  Once again, don't bog something down with regulations.  Get back to the roots of PTP and increase you staffing in Marine Inspection Offices.  They know better than anyone, what's going on in the real world of the Passenger Vessel Industry.

7.  Why complicate the world.  Allow your USCG Inspectors to rate the operators and then see exactly where the problem is. It is not with the Professional Operators.

8.  Use a tiered approach.  Analyze where Risk of Life is in each operation.  What factors would create Risk of Life.  Each operator should be able to mitigate that risk.  Serious Injury is the next tier.  Steps should be made by the operator to mitigate this tier.  The USCG Marine Inspecion Teams are already engaging with Operators to provide information on mitigation measures.  If anything, the Marine Inspection Teams are understaffed.

9.  One size does not fit all.  They are good references.  Each operation is unique.

10. Guidance is always great.  Engagement with the Local Marine Inspectors is also helpful.  We are partners in this.

11. N/A Have own plans and training.

12. You always have additional costs with a SMS.  When you focus on safety and security you will incur time training your crews and discussing best practices.

13. N/A

14. I drafted the original work after a USCG Seminar on the PTP.  All of your professional operators did this when the USCG reached out to us.  Over time this original work has been added to.  It has also been bullet pointed into key important areas of focus.  Your crew must first learn fundamentals.  After this, they can move into becoming true professionals.  We have a fleet of 3 vessels.

15.  You have the system already.  USCG Marine Inspectors.  They are understaffed.  

16.  ABSOLUTELY NOT.  USCG Marine Inspectors only.

17.  We have a fundamentals class, and then build on that foundation.

18.  We already are engaged with training.

19.  Regulations do not help.

20.  Non-USCG Third Party Audits would be a complete waste of my time.  I do internal audits myself.

21.  Get more Marine Inspectors in your Sectors.  Allow them to reach out to the Operators.  Provide a basic bullet point fundamental framework to start with and check up with these operators.

22.  Ask your Marine Inspectors.  They are true professionals and on the front line.  Many of these individuals are truly outstanding......Ask them!

This email is in reference to potential Safety Management Systems being required for all domestic passenger vessels.  As a captain, boat and tour company owner I am in favor of protecting the public but this proposal goes too far.  Public safety should be a priority but reacting to a few specific incidents seems to me as overkill.  Generalizing across the entire US fleet of passenger vessels will create a complicated spiderweb of undue regulations and oversight.  There will be an alarming number of vessel owners that will drop their vessels from the voluntary inspected status to un-inspected in order to circumvent the system.  Please reconsider this requirement and apply to specific types of vessels or operating conditions that the USCG deems necessary. Thank you for your time. ",,,,,,,

My son Daniel Garcia perished on the dive boat Conception on Labor Day, 2019.  I am a retired emergency management professional with 50 years experience in the petroleum and petrochemical industries and have lived the benefits of Safety Management Systems in those industries.  It is my sincere belief that implementing such systems in passenger vessels will save lives and improve the safety of crew and passengers.  My comments follow (referencing the questions in the ANPRM).

1.	The requirement for an SMS should include but not be limited to vessels that have overnight accommodations for 10 or more people as well as an onboard mess for feeding those passengers and crew.  It should be noted that in the petroleum and petrochemical industries, Safety Management Systems have dramatically reduced reportable incident rates, reportable environmental releases, and other key measures of safety and environmental management performance.
2.	A scalable and structured SMS would provide passenger vessel owners, managers, and operators many benefits.  A primary benefit is that an SMS would encourage and facilitate the interchange of lessons learned - both in the identification risk and the approaches to mitigating those risks.  The development of common solutions to identified risks and deficiencies will reduce the cost of those responses. 
3.	The wide use of Safety Management Systems in the petroleum and petrochemical industries has demonstrated the value of sharing lessons learned.  Sharing lessons can extend between fleet owners as well and also provide support for single-vessel owners.
4.	Several SMS templates should be developed for different types of fleets, e.g., dive boats, ferries, tour boats, etc.  This would be a great help for small companies that might not have experienced safety management professionals on staff.  The templates would include procedures for launching the systems, training personnel in auditing and documentation processes, communications to upper management/ownership as well as vessel management teams, etc.  
5.	Unable to comment.
6.	No.  The use of Safety Management Systems across the various sectors of passenger vessels will be a more proactive approach and will also facilitate USCG monitoring of system implementation and performance.
7.	Unable to comment.
8.	Unable to comment.
9.	Industry standards, e.g., fire codes, should be incorporated by reference, especially in regard to the increasing load demands on vessel electrical systems for charging electronic devices, etc.
10.	Several SMS templates should be developed for different types of fleets, e.g., dive boats, ferries, tour boats, etc.  This would be a great help for small companies that might not have experienced safety management professionals on staff.  The templates would include procedures for launching the systems, training personnel in auditing and documentation processes, communications to upper management/ownership as well as vessel management teams, etc.  The USCG should make personnel available to conduct online seminars to assist owners in implementation.  Such seminars as well as specific training modules could be available for streaming to other owners.
11.	Unable to comment.
12.	Companies with many vessels may need to establish a full-time position to oversee implementation and steward progress towards implementation and measures of performance.  Smaller companies may need to rely on consulting firms to assist in modification of SMS templates for their organizations and implementing those systems.
13.	Not an operator; unable to comment.
14.	If templates are available, a realistic timeline for adapting and implementing an SMS would be 12-18 months.
15.	The USCG should require a certification process and an ongoing audit process.  Both could be conducted by approved third-party companies with experience in SMS.
16.	The USCG should conduct some audits, especially in the early stages of the program.  Candidates for future audits by the Coast Guard could be determined by reviewing the results of third-party audits.  Audits should be conducted after the first full year of implementation and then every 36 months.
17.	Beyond any position-specific training that they already receive, some crew members would require a general overview of their company/vessel SMS and how to conduct and report self-audits and measures of performance.
18.	Not an operator; unable to comment.
19.	Not an operator; unable to comment.
20.	Unable to comment.
21.	The carrot-and-stick approach would be appropriate.  There should be realistic timelines and deadlines for implementation with penalties for noncompliance.  A well-publicized certification by the Coast Guard or recognized third-party entity can offer branding and marketing benefits for operators.
22.	The focus above all should be on improving the safety of crew and passengers.  An additional benefit would be areas of environmental performance.

The SMS for each ship could account for differences between ships, if applicable, and operations in the event of a problem occurring in just one ship. This type of system could help in preventing people from receiving injury because of lack of communication and lack of knowledge in case of an accident or problem.",,,,,,,

I do think that this increase in SMS procedures is something that can help the safety of passengers. By taking the events such as the tourist boat explosion in the Bahamas in 2018 which resulted in lives lost, it can be easy to asses the situation and wonder if the horrible accident could have been avoided if there were more procedures or percussions taken. I believe that enforcing these new SMS procedures creates two different sides, people who want safety but do not understand the technical impact of these changes, and the side of people who deal with the already heavy workload of different percussions and what not. Although I can understand that these changes may result in added work to the already plentiful loads that boat owners have, it should be worth anything to save any passenger on a vessel from potentially loosing their life.

Question #1:
I believe the Coast Guard should require a Safety Management System for a wide range if passenger vessels including:
- any passenger vessel that has overnight accommodations
- any passenger vessel carrying 12 or more passengers (should be at least as strict as the current international traveling vessels)
- any passenger vessel traveling more than a half hour's reach for emergency response (medical, fire, explosion, etc)
- passenger vehicles that are stand alone or part of a fleet.  The number of vessels is not important compared to having a SMS in place.
2.  A scalable SMS for fleets makes sense, but SMS should be required per above regardless of whether it can be scaled or apply to a fleet.  It is not necessarily less likely that individual passenger vessels would face an emergency situation.  In the case of the Conception, that vessel was one of only three vessels operated by Truth Aquatics, but it could have just as easily been the only vessel operated by Truth Aquatics.
3. A SMS should absolutely be shared with all vessels in a fleet and there must be explicit requirements for doing so, including evidence that it has been done.   It makes no sense to do anything less than this. 
In their Marine Accident Report “Fire aboard Small Passenger Vessel Conception” (NTSB/MAR-20/03 PB2020-0101011) the National Transportation Safety Board documented an interview with a passenger from a trip on October 8, 2018 on the Vision, another vessel owned and operated by Truth Aquatics.  In this interview, this passenger Mr. Savage recounted being asleep in the bunkroom of the Vision when a battery charging fire started in the aft salon.  He recalled being told that his charging batteries had exploded and caught fire around 4:30-5:00 in the morning.  The following morning the Captain indicated that all battery charging at nighttime was to cease.
Had this incident been shared with the sistership Conception and an investigation and response been performed through a robust fleetwide SMS System in October of 2018 it is entirely possible that 33 passengers and one crew member may not have perished onboard the Conception on September 2, 2019.
So, have I encountered situations in which information about safety risks or best practices were know to one vessel but not shared with others that might use it to prevent incidents?  I absolutely have and this lack of sharing resulted in the loss of my Husband and Daughter.  I truly believe that an SMS System in practice during the 2018 incident would have saved the lives of 34 people.
4. A SMS should be implemented across a fleet the same way that any business with branches or operations in multiple locations -- through clear communications and requirements for compliance.  All crew responsible for the safety of each vessel must be required to be trained in SMS and have required ""refresher"" trainings for both the captain as well as all other crew members.  The reason that all crew members should be trained is because you simply won't know which crew member(s) will be in the position to implement SMS procedures.  For example, the captain may be injured in a fire or explosion and thus another crew member may have to carry out the SMS procedures.  This is not a difficult thing to implement.  The Coast Guard should have a process to verify that the training and equipment is in place at least on a yearly basis.  
6. The important thing is that the SMS or whatever the process for achieving safety requirements include all recommendations from The NTSB Marine Accident Report (NTSB/MAR-20/03 PB2020-0101011).
7. No.  In addition to SMS, additional regulations are also necessary to incorporate the requirements contained in the Regulations for Covered Small Passenger Vessels passed in the National Defense Authorization Act of 2021.  The regulations required by this Act ensure compliance with overnight roving patrols.  These regulations are critical as the failure to provide the overnight roving patrol was determined to be the probable cause of the Conception tragedy which took the life of my husband and daughter.  In addition, the Act provides for additional regulations for the safe handling, storage, and operation of lithium-ion batteries, improved fire and safety training protocols, increased fire detection and suppression systems, interconnected fire detection equipment including audible and visual alarms, two independent avenues of escape and a protocol and monitoring devices to ensure a roving patrol is awake and on active duty.  Having a robust fleetwide SMS will help ensure that these important regulatory requirements are adhered to.

8.  A SMS is justified, period. A maintenance plan or emergency plan doesn’t take the place of full SMS.

22. Are there any additional factors that we should consider? We lost two of our best in Scott and Kendra Chan from this senseless tragedy. Let us act now to prevent it from ever happening again. 

1: For which types of passenger vessels should the Coast Guard require an SMS? A Safety Management System (SMS) should be required for as wide a range of passenger vessels as possible to assure greatest potential to save lives. One criteria could be vessels that travel more than a half-hours distance from emergency help in the case of a disaster.

3: To what extent would an SMS encourage sharing and prevent the ""siloing"" of information in which information about safety risks or best practices was known to one vessel not not sure with others? A SMS should absolutely be shared with all vessels in a fleet and there must be explicit requirements for doing so, including evidence that it has been done.

7: If a comprehensive SMS is required, are there more prescriptive USCG regulations currently in the CFR that could be removed because the SMS would serve a similar function in promoting safety? No.  In addition to SMS, additional regulations are also necessary to incorporate the requirements contained in the Regulations for Covered Small Passenger Vessels passed in the National Defense Authorization Act of 2021. These regulations ensure compliance with overnight roving patrols. The failure to provide the overnight roving patrol was determined to be the probable cause of the Conception tragedy. In addition the Act provides for additional regulations for the safe handling, storage, and operation of lithium ion batteries, improved fire and safety training protocols, increased fire detection and suppression systems, interconnected fire detection equipment including audible and visual alarms, two independent routes of escape and a protocol and monitoring devices to ensure a roving patrol is awake and on active duty. 

8. If a comprehensive SMS is not necessary or justified, what aspects of an SMS would be appropriate to include in this regulatory framework? A SMS is justified, period. A maintenance plan or emergency plan doesn’t take the place of full SMS. 

15. Should the Coast Guard require a certification process, an audit process or both? Yes. I firmly believe in certifications and audits; meaning review, approval, and oversight by the Coast Guard. If you don’t have such a program, including auditing, then how do we know if operators are meeting the standards?

16. Should the Coast Guard-required SMS be subject solely to independent third-party audits? Yes. An industry-run audits run the risk of overlooking deficiencies and pose internal conflicts of interest. A third party audit by a body with no financial or other conflict of interest should be required. It should be done at least annually and without prior notice.

17. What training or knowledge requirements are appropriate for crewmembers on passenger vessels with an SMS? Crewmembers need to be tested frequently (quarterly) through drills to assure that they are trained and fully knowledgeable to respond to potential hazards and accidents. 

19. How would the costs and benefits of expanding other existing regulations differ from the costs and benefits of requiring SMSs for all passenger vessels? The SMS should be required, period.  The SMS should have been required a decade ago and the consequences of the failure to implement and enforce can be measured by the loss of lives.",,,,,,,

Are there any additional factors that we should consider? Scott Chan had dedicated his life to the next generation by becoming a high school physics teacher after a highly successful career as an engineer. Scott was highly regarded by his students and peers. He also shared his expertise frequently with other teachers, helping their students as well. The pain felt by Scott's students because of this preventable and heart-breaking loss is unfathomable. Studies show that a teacher as effective at teaching physics as Scott adds hundreds of thousands of dollars to the lifetime income of their students. This tragedy was a large economic loss, the costs associated with preventing another by these rules are negligible. Kendra Chan was at the start of a career that would have resulted in large positive impacts to the environmental health of our planet. Her loss hurts everyone on Earth.

Well said. The first amendment is the bedrock of democracy, which is why would-be dictators like President Trump are so uncomfortable with it. I'm not talking about Trump's juvenile tweets about journalists and media outlets, as even morons like Trump have rights. I'm talking about his threats and actions:
- taking away a White House reporter's press credentials
- barring reporters from events
- punishing Amazon because its owner also owns the Washington Post
- having DOJ try to block a merger between AT&T and Time Warner because Trump hates CNN
- using federal troops to disperse peaceful protesters
- banning TikTok after Sarah Cooper created a bunch of viral videos mocking Trump
- blocking critics on Twitter
- threatening Facebook, Twitter because they take down Trump posts that violate their policies

It's a shame that USCG has such a weak, embarrassing CINC. But hopefully it's a short term problem.",,,,,,,

re docket USCG-2020-0144-0001
Cocos Crossing swim event in the waters of Cocos Lagoon, Merizo, Guam 

Dear Chief Petty Officer Davis,

We believe that the traditional waters of the Chamorro Nation belong to the traditional chiefs of the Chamorro Peoples to determine whether and if so how, to permit, use and events under DHS USCG
sponsorship such as the Cocos Crossing swim event. Swimming is a traditional Chamorro sport. 

In the 1940s the Chief of Naval Operations and the US State Department opined that Micronesians were not citizens of their own islands even, but mere  ""residents of the islands.""

Recently Judge Waddoups in Fitisemanu v US, held that American Samoa, quit claimed by her matai chiefs to the US, was within the US for purposes of birthright citizenship, nunc pro tunc, dating back to the Deeds of Cession in 1899, even though Congress did not accept the Deeds until act in 1925. https://casetext.com/case/fitisemanu-v-united-states
By the same logic, Guam is also in the US since 1898, and citizens since then, too. But 8 USC 1401(b) says that aboriginal Americans are entitled to maintain their tribal property and rights, even if deemed American citizens. 

25 USC 2902 and 2904 require the rulemaking be promulgated in the Federal Register and on Guahan, in Chamorro, not only in English. A Carolinian version may also be required, and indeed Palauan too, as the FAS and COFA state residents in Guam also qualify for 25 USC 2902 and 2904 rights, see Meyer v Nebraska, 
and see Farrington v. Tokushige, 273 U.S. 284 (1927).
Chamorros, like Formosans, remain wards of the military government of the US, https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1944v05/d1218
Non-Japanese Inhabitants of Formosa
 tribal aborigines as wards of the military government (PWC-19463).

https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1944v05/d1208 
 tribal aborigines, who are akin to the non-Christian peoples of Northern Luzon, are neither Japanese nor Chinese, but more properly to be considered as wards of whatever government has control of the island.
Section 302.
Any person who becomes a citizen of the United States ... become a national but not a citizen of the United States by making a declaration under oath before any court established by the Constitution or laws of the United States or any court of record in the Commonwealth in the form as follows:

""I ______________ being duly sworn, hereby declare my intention to be a national but not a citizen of the United States.""
Even though most Chamorros are US citizens, some who resided in the CNMI, could elect to remain wards, but not citizens, of the US, as DHS has ruled:

https://www.uscis.gov/i-9-central/complete-correct-form-i-9/who-needs-form-i-9/federated-states-micronesia-republic-marshall-islands-and-palau  

The instructions for Form I-9, Employment Eligibility Verification, state that the term ""noncitizen national of the United States"" includes ""certain former citizens of the former Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands."" This refers to a very small group of people living in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands in 1986 who chose voluntarily to give up their new U.S. citizenship. This does not apply to citizens of the FSM, RMI, or Palau, although many of them are also citizens of the former Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands (TTPI).  

https://www.gao.gov/products/473806#mt=e-report 

The Comptroller General noted Guamanians are not aliens to the US even before ""granted"" ""citizenship"", unless the act of 1917 does not include Chamorros because deemed not even ""citizens"" of their own islands!:

SECTION 1 OF THE ACT OF FEBRUARY 5, 1917, 39 STAT. 874, REGULATING THE IMMIGRATION OF ALIENS TO THE UNITED STATES, PROVIDES:

THAT THE WORD ""ALIEN"" WHEREVER USED IN THIS ACT SHALL INCLUDE ANY PERSON NOT A NATIVE-BORN OR NATURALIZED CITIZEN OF THE UNITED STATES; BUT THIS DEFINITION SHALL NOT BE HELD TO INCLUDE INDIANS OF THE UNITED STATES NOT TAXED OR CITIZENS OF THE ISLANDS UNDER THE JURISDICTION OF THE UNITED STATES. THAT THE TERM ""UNITED STATES"" AS USED IN THE TITLE AS WELL AS IN THE VARIOUS SECTIONS OF THIS ACT SHALL BE CONSTRUED TO MEAN THE UNITED STATES, AND ANY WATERS, TERRITORY, OR OTHER PLACE SUBJECT TO THE JURISDICTION THEREOF, 

And note that even if Chamorros are citizens, that does not mean they are no longer wards of the nation, or that their traditional lands and seas somehow become American.

The Comptroller General has ruled:

IT MAY BE STATED AS A GENERAL RULE THAT THE GRANTING OF CITIZENSHIP TO INDIANS DOES NOT ALTER THE RELATIONSHIP OF GUARDIAN AND WARD BETWEEN SUCH INDIANS AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

The addition of these anchorage spots increases the safety of navigation on the Mississippi River by allowing ships to cross the bar into the river during periods ideal conditions and stage for berths and inspections inside of the protected waters of the river.  In most of these cases the anchorages already exist in these areas, the public comment only addresses additional length of the anchorages to accommodate and additional ship or two .  Collectively the expansions of these existing anchorages add several spots.  Additionally these anchorage spots are utilized for emergency mooring during periods of reduced visibility, mechanical issues, quarantine issues, etc.

There are comments attached that the additional anchorage spots would interfere with costal restoration borrow sites.  These comments are not true.  Traditionally projects requiring dredged material work in a symbiotic relationship with the anchorages whereas the anchorages benefit from removal sediment deposits which in turn deepens the anchorage area and the coastal restoration projects get the needed material.  

If the projects truly had conflicts with one another then it would be impossible for the restoration projects to acquire fill materials from anchorages, but this has not been the case.

I currently serve as the President of the Maritime Navigation Safety Association which reviews USACE permits and provides feedback on any potential safety concerns.  To date the group has worked closely with the USCG, USACE and various entities to manages safety concerns and maximize use of the river for all interests.

Sharing of space and resources does require some cooperation and communication and perhaps this is the true concern.  The MNSA Board has requested inclusion of communications plans, estimated timelines and details on any required channel/anchorage closures and outer limits of anchoring equipment for the purposes of ensuring that the equipment used to remove the sediment does not pose an unknown risk to not only anchoring ships but also passing traffic.

The industry has a long history of working with coastal restoration projects and choosing not to use anchorage positions to facilitate dredging.  Coastal restoration is important to MNSA as a whole because we live and work in Louisiana and integrity of the Louisiana Coastal Marsh helps preserve navigation channel integrity.  The MNSA group has facilitated studies to study impact on outflow channels, particularly in the Wills Point and Ironton (Myrtle Grove) areas.  

These additional spots dedicated to anchorages also set these areas aside from other development such as terminals and barge fleets.  It is much easier to move a could of ships around in an anchorage or choose not to use a couple of spots than it is to work around infrastructure that is permanently affixed in place.  

In short, these anchorages are greatly needed for safety reasons, facilitation of commerce and to preserve these borrow sites for coastal restoration project coordination.

Thank you for the opportunity to comment.",,,,,,,

Re:	Port Access Route Study; Seacoast of NJ and Approaches to DE Bay (NJ/DE PARS)
	USCG-2020-0172

Dear Mr. Barnes and Mr. Creelman:

I am writing on behalf of Garden State Seafood Association (GSSA) based in Trenton, New Jersey.  GSSA represents roughly 1,200 commercial fishermen operating within the State, as well as the land based processor, Seafood Co-Ops, distribution system and many seafood retailers.  In 2016, a NMFS technical paper ranked New Jersey's seafood industry sixth in the U.S with sales of $6.2 billion, income of $1.4 billion and value-added of $2.3 billion.  For the East Coast, New Jersey ranked second that year. The economic impacts of the NJ seafood industry, including imports, were 37,127 jobs, $6.2 billion in sales, $1.4 billion in income, and $2.3 billion in value- added impacts.  

New Jersey's commercial fishing industry is one of the largest year-round employers in many of our coastal communities and generates thousands of direct and indirect year-round jobs in our Coastal Communities. The Industry is concentrated at five major coastal ports, namely; Belford, Pt. Pleasant, Barnegat Light, Atlantic City, and Cape May/Wildwood.  In addition, another port is located on the Delaware Bay (Port Norris) in Cumberland County.  Each port has fishing vessels that harvest a myriad of finfish and shellfish such as Atlantic scallops, monkfish, shortfin and longfin squid, Atlantic mackerel, tunas, swordfish, black sea bass, summer flounder, Atlantic surfclams, and ocean quahogs. A total of 190,500,000 pounds of finfish and shellfish were landed by New Jersey's commercial fishermen in 2018 with a landed value of $170,261,000.  Four of the top six commercial fishing ports in the Mid-Atlantic are found in New Jersey.

Thank you for the opportunity to provide comments on the Notice of Study (NOS) for the NJ/DE PARS.  We appreciate the USCG focusing, primarily, on the need for long-term fishing vessel access within and safe transit through planned or potential offshore wind energy development in this region.  Obviously with the size and scope of our association, transit through these areas from home ports in all weather conditions will be of the greatest concern.

Additionally note, some federal permits such as scallops run on a strict 24 hour clock for days at sea.  So any delay in transiting from base ports to fishing grounds and returning voyages represent a direct cost to our vessels and those businesses. Not only are current wind development projects of concern, but compounded with the proposed build out of all projects represent significant transit issues.  Also recognize the value of many fragile species such as squid will be negatively impacted by transit delays.    

We are concerned that after several requests were filed requesting a public hearing a month past per your requirements on this study, no hearing has been scheduled prior to the deadline for comments today.  

our comments are attached
Sincerely,

East to the edge of the Canadian line. Mostly fishing for sea scallops on a limited access vessel. When the weather gets bad sometimes we head to the coastline to get away from brutal weather. In the winter this helps us not take much spray so we don't accumulate ice. It looks to me that these proposed lease areas would be in the location that we go to so we can get to safety. Fishing for sea scallops we tend to catch more on the windy days dealing with wind and waves, other fisherman towing in a different direction is enough. Now add a group of electric generating turbines with cables on the bottom would make that a nightmare. Not just fishing but transiting in these areas during dense fog like conditions and bad weather would be quite difficult and dangerous especially if the wind is not the same as the transit lane direction. Especially if there is a problem with the vessel. I have had to operate a vessel in the open ocean to help a crew member get air lifted. As I can remember the coast guard chopper asked me to get my 9 knot commercial scallop vessel remain at top speed for as long and steady as I could in rough seas to help land the basket. With the spacing of the turbines I don't see that being possible. If there was a rescue needed at sea would the coast guard be slower in reaction time cause they had to navigate differently or avoid a wind farm area? A man overboard situation would eliminate a Williamson turn in some cases. Wind seems like a great source of renewable energy but why put them in an area that would create fence where for generations fishermen have been working hard to supply the world with food?  It kinda feels like we have been targeted politically. Are you telling me that there is no wind anywhere else? I find that hard to believe. As a fisherman I feel like this is an unnecessary risk that can be avoided by locating turbines on land or inland waters. That way they can be maintained and seen by the public regularly. Because when people can see them they will be more likely to be maintained. My worst fear is abandonment. If these things ever get abandoned we will be stuck with a huge ecological disaster. I don't care what these things are made of they will constantly need maintenance. Would the turbines survive Sandy or perfect storm like conditions? What is the protocol if one or more of these turbines gets wiped out by a rouge wave or a cruise ship full of people or a tanker ship carrying oil accidentally loses maneuverability. My point...there are too many if's.",,,,,,,

If not here's a quick rundown:

After repeatedly saying that Covid-19 is going away and that masks don't work, over twenty Gang members and associates contracted the disease. This included Donald Trump, Melania Trump, Barron Trump, Hope Hicks, Kayleigh McEnany, Kellyanne Conway, Ron Johnson, Mike Lee, Thom Tillis, Chris Christie and on and on.

Then a couple of weeks later, after continuing to flout mask and social distancing guidelines, several of Mike Pence's aides contracted Covid-19.

And most recently Mark Meadows, David Bossie and Ben Carson have come down with Covid-19. So in total the White House has had not one, not two, but three separate outbreaks of Covid-19. And the Gang is so married to Trump's anti-mask dogma that not even a medical doctor (Ben Carson) was willing to follow CDC recommendations.

There's probably more to come, as the Gang has two more months in the White House before they either leave peacefully or are escorted out by federal agents.",,,,,,,

DeJoy of course will say that Trump never asked him to do anything, that all of his actions are intended to cut costs and improve efficiency, that USPS can easily handle the additional mail from the election, etc.

This is missing the point. DeJoy's goal is to share public confidence in USPS' ability to deliver ballot applications and ballots on time. He has already achieved this through headlines about undelivered mail piling up in sorting stations and post offices. It's the same tactic Russian troll farms used in the 2016 election. They didn't need to actually hack into voting machines, just to rattle traditionally Democratic voters through a coordinated disinformation campaign.

Vote. Trump. Out.",,,,,,,

Well no, not to his MAGA base. But perhaps the fact that Trump MET WITH SUPPORTERS even after experiencing Covid-19 symptoms will. The fact is that Trump doesn't care about you, and he is perfectly willing to risk your catching and dying from Covid-19 if he thinks it's good for his reelection campaign.

Matthew T. Bell, Jr.
Rear Admiral

Commander 17th Coast Guard District

Admiral Bell:

I am writing in full support of recertification of the Cook Inlet Regional Citizens Advisory Council (CIRCAC). For 30 years, CIRCAC has been Cook Inlet's most effective organization for promoting programs to prevent spills, enhance safety in both marine transportation and oil facilities operations, and protect Cook Inlet's waters, shorelines, cultural, natural and wildlife resources. Over most of those 30 years I have worked with CIRCAC first as a regulator then a volunteer.

CIRCAC advocates for better regulatory oversight and safety measures, they contribute concrete solutions on how to achieve those goals by working with the regulated community and the citizens. This includes advocating risk assessments, sharing data, developing applicable tools and strategies, evaluating best available technology, engaging the public, and thoroughly reviewing contingency plans and regulations that prioritize prevention while promoting safety. No other organization has focused as much attention for as many years to identifying, assessing and mitigating risks in this region.

CIRCAC has been proactive in identifying risks and developing recommendations to address them; an example is the recently completed Cook Inlet Pipeline Integrity Assessment. Through this project, a full catalog of Cook Inlet's undersea pipeline system was documented allowing a panel of experts, operators and the public to recommend risk reduction measures before problems arise. 

Working with industry, CIRCAC has also been able to achieve the long-term goal of closing the Drift River Oil Terminal on the West side of Cook Inlet. Situated at the base of Mt. Redoubt, Drift River posed a significant safety hazard in the event of a natural disaster. Now, that oil is transported via pipeline, greatly reducing unnecessary risk.

CIRCAC's science program provides valuable data about coastal habitats, physical oceanography and oil behavior. Current research will generate new information about how biological debris interacts with oil as it moves through the water column.

CIRCAC continues to strengthen oil spill contingency plans and recommend substantive changes to ensure facilities are adequately staffed and that the plans are executable.

CIRCAC's accomplishments in the last three years include, but are certainly not limited to:
Completing multi-year near-shore habitat assessment
Launching groundbreaking study of marine snow as an oil transporter
Advocating for a strengthening of oil spill prevention and response regulations
Increasing public outreach efforts through new, local advertising, exhibits and expanding audiences for its newsletter, website, and social media
Expanding Geographic Response Information Database (GRID) in scope and accessibility
Working with regulators to maintain a robust Vessels of Opportunity program
Upgrading the Cook Inlet Ice Monitoring Camera Network with modern video technology

Since its inception, CIRCAC has maintained a balance approach to meeting it mandate under OPA90.  The CIRCAC Council fairly represents the diverse Cook Inlet community in directing the organization.  CIRCAC forms and strengthened partnerships and encouraged consensus decision-making. Through this process, CIRCAC brings a varied group of stakeholders together to create environmental monitoring and oil spill prevention programs to promote safe production and transportation of oil in Cook Inlet.

I strongly urge the U.S. Coast Guard to re-certify CIRCAC so that it can continue to build on its work and positively impact the future of Cook Inlet. 

Sincerely 


Robert C. Flint

Matthew T. Bell, Jr.
Rear Admiral
United States Coast Guard
Commander 17th Coast Guard District

Admiral Bell:

I am writing in full support of recertification of the Cook Inlet Regional Citizens Advisory Council (CIRCAC).

The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 created the Regional Citizens Advisory Councils. As explained by Congress, ""many people believe that complacency on the part of the industry and government personnel responsible for monitoring the operation of the Valdez terminal and vessel traffic in Prince William Sound was one of the contributing factors to the EXXON VALDEZ oil spill""
 ""One way to combat this complacency is to involve local citizens in the process of    preparing, adopting, and revising oil spill contingency plans"".

I have seen the value of the Cook Inlet Regional Citizens Council and the valuable programs and studies they have completed are a definite safety and pollution prevention assets for the Cook Inlet Area. 

CIRCAC is a success story that came out of a belief in 1990. 

CIRCAC has been proactive in identifying risks and developing recommendations to address them; an example is the recently completed Cook Inlet Pipeline Integrity Assessment. Through this project, a full catalog of Cook Inlet's undersea pipeline system was documented allowing a panel of experts, operators and the public to recommend risk reduction measures before problems arise. 

Working with industry, CIRCAC has also been able to achieve the long-term goal of closing the Drift River Oil Terminal on the West side of Cook Inlet. Situated at the base of Mt. Redoubt, Drift River posed a significant safety hazard in the event of a natural disaster. Now, that oil is transported via pipeline, greatly reducing unnecessary risk.

CIRCAC's science program provides valuable data about coastal habitats, physical oceanography and oil behavior. Current research will generate new information about how biological debris interacts with oil as it moves through the water column.

CIRCAC continues to strengthen oil spill contingency plans and recommend substantive changes to ensure facilities are adequately staffed and that the plans are executable. 


CIRCAC's accomplishments in the last three years include, but are certainly not limited to:

	Completing multi-year near-shore habitat assessment
	Launching groundbreaking study of marine snow as an oil transporter
	Advocating for a strengthening of oil spill prevention and response regulations 
	Increasing public outreach efforts through new, local advertising, exhibits and expanding audiences for its newsletter, website, and social media
	Expanding Geographic Response Information Database (GRID) in scope and accessibility
	Working with regulators to maintain a robust Vessels of Opportunity program
	Upgrading the Cook Inlet Ice Monitoring Camera Network with modern video technology

Since its inception, CIRCAC has formed and strengthened partnerships and encouraged consensus decision-making. Through this process, CIRCAC brings a varied group of stakeholders together to create environmental monitoring and oil spill prevention programs to promote safe production and transportation of oil in Cook Inlet.

I strongly urge the U.S. Coast Guard to recertify CIRCAC so that it can continue to build on its work and positively impact the future of Cook Inlet.

This regulation is asking for a safety zone to be enforced on certain waters of the lake during a firework show on June 6, 2020. This rule would prohibit people and watercrafts from being in the safety zone unless otherwise authorized by the designated representative. 

I think the agency is asking something that is very well valid, and much needed to enforce during the time of the show. It is needed because the public safety will be put at risk if the area is compromised during the time of the show. Failure to implement will result in possible ""accidents"" within the public and or serious injury/deaths from explosives. Accidental ""falling red embers"" from firework debris within the safety zone is not acceptable to the public's safety.

The need for this regulation to be put into place is to keep the public safe from the possible hazards from the fireworks display scheduled for June 6, 2020. Possible hazards that the agency discusses are ""accidental discharge of fireworks, dangerous projectiles, and falling hot embers or other debris."" The agency's argument and purpose for this regulation is well thought out and very valid. The possibility of a mishap occurring is one that the agency needs to be aware of and be ready to deal with anything happens. One of the agency's responsibilities is to enforce rules and regulations that keep the public safe, and by them enforcing a safety zone, in which only authorized personnel are allowed, the agency is within their specific job duty. The regulation should be passed and enforced for the firework display that is scheduled.

This rule has good intentions to support it because it is centered around people's safety.  Because the range is limited to 420 feet, it still allows people to travel around the lake in a safe manner, and those that need within the restricted area can apply for an allowance to be in the area from the Coast Guard if they have a reasonable reason. For those this rule may greatly affect, it is only during one day of the year so they would have the ability to plan around this occurrence. ",,,,,,,

With as many as 6,000 people participating in the swim portion of the triathlon, it is imperative that those in charge of the harbor put the safety of the participants first. Allowing kayaks, paddleboards, and small boats in the water during the triathlon would likely result in serious injury to a significant portion of the 6,000 participants. By passing this rule the Coast Guard could effectively mitigate the potential for injury to participants in the swim. Furthermore, this rule would only be in effect for three days and only in certain waters. This seems like a small sacrifice to make to insure the safety of the participants.

The lake is their home and these participants, vessels and water toys are just there for activity purposes. They are disturbing the home of the wildlife and scaring them into hiding. Wildlife should be the number one priority and all rules and regulations should be to protect them first. These humans and objects are invading their space so it seems backwards that they would be the ones to be protected. I understand this triathlon is just three days out of the year but the wildlife in the lake will be terrified and it may prevent them from coming out of hiding for a little while after the event is over. I ask of you to take the lives of the fish and plants in the lake serious and consider putting regulations in place to protect them as well. ",,,,,,,

Meanwhile back in Covid-land the Trump administration keeps sinking lower and lower. The Justice Dept under Bill Barr acts as Trump's personal legal team, authorized to investigate his enemies (Biden) and let his friends (Flynn) off the hook. Meanwhile over at HHS when a top virologist decided to focus on science rather than Trump's quack medicine, he was demoted and smeared. Ditto for a Navy commander who prioritized protecting his crew over protecting his superiors' behinds. And don't get me started on that vacuous twit, Kushner.

The size and scope outlined in the docket is satisfactory to accommodate expected continued growth of traffic servicing the port of Wilmington and MOTSU and will improve navigation safety  The geographic area being considered is currently where our Association recommends vessels awaiting transit to anchor.  The area is known for suitable bottom for safe anchorage and is located a safe distance from the charted pilot boarding area to accommodate adequate leeway for embarking/disembarking maneuvers.  Anchoring vessels routinely rely on our associations instructions on anchoring locations as no such location is designated on navigational charts.  Furthermore, the current designated explosives anchorage at Lockwood Folly Inlet is insufficient for larger explosives laden vessels with known deeper drafts and should be eliminated and relocated as described in Docket ID USCG-2020-0216.

I'm assuming that the planned Broadcast Notice to Mariners will occur before the commencement of the display.  Even though the secured area during the display is only anticipated to impact a small sector of the naval traffic lane, some commercial traffic may still have concern over the remote proximity of fireworks. If this is not already in the plan, I suggest that a Securite' message be broadcast to announce the end of the fireworks display.

Since I have never been to Guam I needed to look this up in Wikipedia. Apra harbor has a fascinating history, from fishing and whaling to Japanese occupation to liberation and now to use by the Navy, recreation boaters and scuba divers exploring shipwrecks. And I'm sure that USCG knows even more about this harbor, so I fully approve the proposed rule.

By the way Wikipedia is a convenient resource for gathering some basic facts about a place, person or event. If President Trump spent a few minutes on Wikipedia he would learn that Covid-19 is not ""going away"" in the US -- quite the contrary. Of course since Trump is an illiterate moron he would need to be spoon fed this information by a trusted source like Sean Hannity or Rudy Giuliani.",,,,,,,

Wallace and Associates (W&A) is a consulting firm that represents commercial fishing interest.  Many of our clients operate large fishing vessels that deploy fishing gear that comes in contact with the ocean floor.  W&A is aware of that the United States Coast Guard ( USCG) agreed with the Vineyard Wind's proposed turbine spacing of one by one nautical mile (NM) between the turbines as adequate for safe transit through Vineyard Wind, wind farm off Martha's Vineyard.  Because there are no prescribed transit, lanes and the turbines are so close together that fisheries research, fishing and search and rescue within the array is at best difficult, dangerous and in some cases impossible.  The precedents set by the Vineyard Wind proposal and accepted by the Coast Guard is going to have destructive consequences for all of the other users of the open ocean.  Our clients disagree with your acceptance of the spacing.  Spreading out the turbines to two by two NM would make the situation more palatable to the other users of the ocean.   They are:
Opening Statement
	One by one, NM between each turbine will set a precedent for all of the other wind developers to do the same.  With thousands of these structures in the offshore waters in New England and the Mid Atlantic, the turbines spacing will cause expensive and safety problems for the other users of the open ocean.  The turbine spacing should be at a least two by two NM apart, and in straight lines in both directions.
Turbine Layout for all of The New England Leases 
	The seven lease holders South and East of Martha's Vineyard have agreed to space all of their turbines in straight rows east and west, and north, and south along with their turbines being one NM apart in the entire area.  It is possible that there could be more than 1,000 turbines in the seven leases.   
Transit Lanes
	The current American ocean users have reviewed your acceptance of the one by one NM turbine spacing, as a precedent it is bewildering.  When all leases are built out a, vessel coming out of Buzzards Bay and going to the scallop grounds south of seven leases, may have to go 80 NM outside of the leases area or steam 40 to 60 NM through the arrays.  No prudent vessel captain would risk his crew and ship to steam through the wind farms, especially if it is dark, foggy. bad weather and with their radar being blinded by the rotating blades, it is too dangerous.  Spreading the turbines out to two by two NM make it more palatable to the other users. 
Fishing Access
	The fishing industry has a number of suggestions including four NM transit lanes and two by two, NM turbine spacing, which would allow transit in any direction and would be enough space for large fishing vessels to fish in the arrays safely in good weather.  
	When the ocean wind developers bid for their leases each was based on about 800 MW of power using 8 MW turbines in the lease area.  Therefore, when the 12 MW turbines became available, they increased their income by up to fifty percent.  However, they are unwilling to help the fishing industry or the other ocean users out by spreading out their turbines out to two by two NM apart.  
Americans Hurt By European Wind Farm Developers 
Research Vessels will not be Able to Complete their Protected Species and Fishery Surveys
	If the spacing of the turbines is not increased, the NOAA fishery research vessels will not be able to sample the lease areas once the turbines are installed.  That means that NOAA's fish populations, protected species and habitat work cannot be performed within the arrays and the quotas of fish will be lowered because there are questions of what the holes in the data would be so the precautionary principle must be considered, meaning reducing the fisheries quotas.
	For surveys of protected species, which is done by aircraft in many cases, using low flying small aircraft.  During surveys, the aircraft normally fly at about 500 feet.   Once the turbines are installed, the aircraft will be required to fly above 2500 feet, which reduces the sightings and the details necessary for identifying the type of whale and markings of whales, dolphins and sea turtles.  This will not be acceptable because of the poor quality of the detailed data collection.
Search and Rescue Within the 1300 Square Miles Wind Arrays.
	If the turbine spacing is one by one NM apart aircraft will be useless in heavy weather.  If an aircraft were to attempting help a distressed vessel there would be little the aircraft crew could do to help from 2500 feet.   
	Therefore, a small boat would be necessary to find the vessel in distress and provide the necessary help.  The amount of extra time it would take to find and get to a vessel that is taking on water or being on fire is going to reduce the chance of a good outcome are much lower.

I don't see any issues reducing by half the area for anchorage as it Is seldom used.  It would be nice if the new building and pier would be constructed in a visually responsible way.

The GOP is a criminal racketeering enterprise. It routinely breaks laws, interferes with free speech, lines its own pockets, bribes foreign countries and tries to intimidate voters. For the good of the country it needs to be legislated out of existence.

I know that you guys can't weigh in on political issues, but if you agree just raise your right eyebrow or something. Maybe the next time President Tiny Hands uses you as a prop.

Thanks!

I believe strongly in it...They came to my office... they said that this will make us and make you the number one environmental president since Teddy Roosevelt...

Here's how greenwashing works. Some filthy polluter creates a park, or sponsors a bill, or maybe just prints ""All Natural!"" on their drums of insecticide. And voila! They're pro-environment. Well Trump can call himself the greatest environmentalist since Saint Cuthbert of Northumbria, but everyone knows that he's Old King Coal. And that he dropped out of the Paris climate agreement, gutted regulations on air and water quality, approved pesticides that are harmful to children and rolled back fuel efficiency standards.

Similarly Trump tells everyone that he's done a ""great job"" on the Covid-19 pandemic because he's only managed to kill 190,000 of us rather than a million. What a twit.",,,,,,,

Fireworks have the potential to cause severe damage to people and property so by having a 420-foot radius safety zone, it will allow vessels and other travelling boats a way to avoid this potential harm. By continuing this safety zone even once the show has concluded, it will provide ample time for proper cleanup for the safety of vessels and boats as well as safety of the cleanup crew. Fireworks can be seen from a distance, so moving viewers will allow them to still enjoy the show, while being a safe distance away from the accidental discharge of the fireworks. ",,,,,,,

Unless there is a person that needs assistance in the river there is no reason to keep the bridge open. It is very cold in New Jersey in the winter so not a lot of people will want to be on a boat in the winter months anyway.

It would seem more pragmatic to the rights of all parties involved to require Newbergh to limit the fireworks display in such a manner that the safety zone only need be much smaller, say no more than two miles at most- in order to limit the potential unconstitutional effects on interstate commerce. I find that, despite the proper rule-making authority- it is still the agency's responsibility to limit the effects of state and local government actions to be as de minimus as possible in terms of effects on interstate commerce.

A completed physical with a physicians signature is normally all that is required to meet coast guard requirements.

There is currently no way for the coast guard to verify that a pilot/master who is obese meets the physical demonstrations requirements except for taking the doctors word for it. For example: bending over and touching your toes, climbing an almost vertical ladder and crawling through a 24"" square hatch.

I see hundreds of captains and pilots every year and for many it is obvious that it is impossible for them to meet the standards of the Mariner Medical manual. Part of this problem is perpetuated by using family doctors whom the member has know for most of his life or company paid doctors who ""may"" have incentive to ""sign off"" on the physical. I'm not claiming any knowledge of illegalities but being in the industry for over 40 years does give me some credibility.

I understand the underlying problems of shortages of pilots and captains but if this is a mandatory requirement it should be verified by some means. For example: Full body profile picture, verified or a third party verification, etc.....  ",,,,,,,

People used to trust the NWS hurricane forecast maps. Then you altered a map with a Sharpie, lied about the path of hurricane Dorian, and got NOAA to back you up and chide the local weather station.

People used to trust the CDC's recommendations. Then you got HHS to intercept hospital data that used to go directly to the CDC and to modify CDC reports.  And you pressured the CDC to weaken its back-to-school and testing guidlines. Yesterday you said that the CDC director was wrong about masks and the availability of a Covid-19 vaccine.

People used to trust the FDA's approval for medicines. Then you got FDA to issue an emergency use authorization for your favorite quack medicine, hydroxychloroquine. And you also got the FDA to laughably misstate the benefits of plasma therapy. And most recently you pressured the FDA to approve a Covid-19 vaccine before the election, even if the phase 3 trials are not complete.

People used to trust USPS to deliver their mail. Then your handpicked board installed Louis DeJoy as Postmaster General so that he could kneecap USPS. I personally have experienced several ridiculous mail delays, and I received a postcard with inaccurate mail-in voting instructions.

These are just a few examples from a long list of institutions you've screwed up. Basically everything you touch turns to crap. I look forward to seeing you and your inept, corrupt family evicted from the White House.",,,,,,,

If they were just proposing this regulation for the fun of it, more than likely I would be opposed to it. The good thing is that it is only temporary so when the Ocean Cup Pacific Rum Run is over other vessels can enter and exit as they please. This regulation is put in to place so that the vessels who would like to enter the designated area will not interfere with the vessels participating in this event. So I agree, if the vessels are traveling at around 100 miles per hour there needs to be no other vessel traveling in that area because someone can get seriously hurt. The coast guard is here to protect our waters and everyone in our waters and they will be doing just that if this regulation is passed!

This rule is to protect the area near Ship Rock, Catalina Island, public vessels, and the high speed vessels participating in the event. This regulation would prohibit vessels from entering into, transiting through, or remaining within the designated area unless specifically authorized by the Captain of the Port, Los AngelesLong Beach, or her designated representative. The safety zone is scheduled to be enforced on the day of the Pacific Rum Run race, which is planned for October 10, 2020. 
After reading the proposed rule thoroughly, I think the proposed safety zone is a good idea to protect the safety of participating parties and the public as this race will involve a high concentration of racing vessels operating at high speed. Moreover, the proposed rule seems to have taken into consideration its impact on other entities, such as small businesses, Indian tribal governments, environment, and protest activities, and it seems like it will not have a significantly negative impact, if any, on those entities. Specifically, it will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities because commercial vessel traffic will be able to safely transit through this safety zone with the Captain and her representatives guidance, and recreational traffic will also be allowed to travel around the safety zone. 
However, I do have a side comment, which is not directly related to the proposed rule itself. I believe the safety zone itself should not have any problem with negatively affecting the environment since it is just a safety zone, but the Pacific Rum race does affect the environment. I dont know anything about this race nor its purposes, but I do think racing vessels will emit a lot of oil and gas that will bring about air and water pollution to the area. Thus, I dont support the idea of having this kind of event. There should be a rule regulating events that could negatively affect the environment.

I do not own a boat, however, the information published in this Federal Register (FR) makes no sense.  What does a company which performs car ""tricks"" have to do which with the ""safety of life"" on navigable waters at Annapolis, MD?  Please explain.  Also, please explain the reason why there is only a 15-day comment period vice the normal 30 days.  A persuasive reason has not been provided for this short time frame other than a lack of tourism.  Tourism drop off covers more than the month of October.  I fail to see the urgency in a car company needing to use and cordon off our waterways.  It makes no sense.  Also, why does there need to be a ""rule"" and the involvement of Homeland Security?  Ordinarily filming in this area is simply published in the local newspapers and the proper arrangements made through the local authorities.  What is Hoonigan Industries filming?  Are they also filming around the Annapolis City Dock?  Are the ""safety zones""  only on the water?  Seriously?  For Hoonigan car racing?  I believe there should be more definitive information published when using Federal Resources during a COVID19 crises.  ",,,,,,,

Just opening up the harbor enough to let us out would be great. And of course to come back in. The revenue that we could lose is up to $3500.

Closing public access to support private movie making is an inconvenience we should not put up with.  The city of Annapolis already closes too much, but at least the reasons are clearly explained, and there is some public benefit, which is sorely lacking in this case.

Hoonigan Industries has no need to use this specific location for this proposed purpose. I own a house in the vicinity and I believe that Hoonigan can find another location for its desired stunt jump where costly and disruptive harm-prevention measures are not necessary.

Further, Hoonigan's proposed purpose for these costly and disruptive measures -- a motorcycle stunt jump -- is unnecessary, bordering on frivolous. It is also dangerous, both to the motorcycle rider himself and to others in the area.

This rule is very respectable and reasonable because of the fact that vessels only need to leave the designated area during filming, which is only a minimal number of hours. Additionally, these enforcements are not during the main tourism season or weekends, causing as minimal economic harm as possible. The proposed rule acknowledges through The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 that this act would not make a significant harmful economic impact on many small entities.This rule puts several considerations on the table, including Executive Order 13175 which shows that this rule would not impact one or more Indian tribes. Overall, this environmental law considers several crucial aspects such as the economy and social inequities, so there is no reason this should not be passed. ",,,,,,,

Like all of us you're doubtless concerned about the Covid-19 pandemic. That's why I want to share some good news. Today the White House science office listed ""ending the COVID-19 pandemic"" as President Trump's biggest achievement. So it's done. Over. Finito.

Oh... except that out in the real world, a thousand Americans are dying every day from Covid-19. Today the US became one of only eight countries in the world to have a Covid-19 per capita death rate above 700 per million. Not only can't Americans travel to other countries, as the infection rate climbs cities are forced to reinstate restriction on activities including indoor dining.

But in Trump's land of Alternative Facts, Covid-19 has been defeated. And Mexico paid for the Wall. And Melania Trump is looking forward to decorating the White House for Christmas.",,,,,,,

This case study is looking at the changes that have occurred in the river over the past 60 years, which includes a change in tributaries, and a drastic increase in the amount of sediment present in the water. Based on this case study, I am in support of establishing an RNA to protect the cap on sediment in the Willamette River. If the sediment in the Willamette River increases, it could potentially start to mirror the Minnesota River which is having negative effects on the community living near the river as well as the agricultural services that use the river for transportation of goods. The Willamette River has the potential of flooding if sediment increases at all, which could affect the nearby floodplains and any houses or structures nearby. If the establishment of an RNA will ensure that the sediment in the river will remain at bay, then it is definitely worth the investment.",,,,,,,

The hazard is adequately marked on the water surface as well as on navigation charts. With the advancement of technology and mechanical innovations as well as the expertise of the pilots that guide vessels in and around Port Tampa Bay, the current restricted navigation area has become outdated. After reading the summary and information given, I see no existing reason why the rule cannot be passed. If the navigation does not pose a threat to wildlife or the underwater pipeline is no longer a concern, then by all means. The removal of the regulated navigation area may even assist seafarers in allowing for quicker travel.

I want to let you know that I am ok with having the On-Demand schedule removed on the weekends.  I am ok with openings on the weekends to be only on the hour and the half-hour just like it is done on the weekdays from Monday to Friday. I also feel that because of the many large charter boats that go out of the Hotel marinas/docks all throughout every day of the week (especially on the weekends) that because of the On-Demand schedule that the bridge is opening too often during the weekdays and weekends and that it causes more traffic congestion than is necessary. It is my opinion that the charter boat captains and their guests that leave from the Hotel marinas/docks can schedule their boats to leave the docks and wait for the bridge to be opened on the hour and the half hour, and that this would reduce the number of bridge openings on the weekend reducing the traffic congestion. There will likely be more boats waiting to go through the 63rd Street bridge on Saturdays and Sundays at certain times of the day, and that the bridge will likely need to remain open a minute or two longer each time it opens up on the hour and the half hour versus the amount of time that the bridge was open in the past with the On-Demand openings. Nevertheless, I am confident that the data you are collecting from the 6 month test will allow you and your team to make the proper decision regarding this issue, but wanted to give my opinion on the matter as stated/offered in the notice that was published/broadcasted to all citizens (and boaters in this waterway) potentially affected by the proposed change. 

What I am not ok with and what I strongly object to is for the curfew that currently exists during the weekdays (from 7 am to 10 am and from 4 pm to 7 pm) to be applied to the weekend days also as was the case this past Sunday, December 20, 2020 in the morning and then again in the afternoon on the same day on Sunday, December 20, 2020.  It appears to have been a mistake on the part of the bridge operator and the acting supervisor of the bridge operator. I received a notice from the City of Miami Beach on December 12, 2020 and the notice never said anything about applying the weekday curfew to the weekend days (Saturdays and Sundays) also when no peak traffic periods exists on the weekends between the hours of 7 am and 10 am or from 4 pm to 7 pm or at any other time of the day. I asked the bridge operator to call her supervisor and she was told by her supervisor that the curfew was also being applied or in place on the weekends also during the 6 month trial period and that the curfew took place in the morning and that it would be also be in effect in the afternoon from 4 pm to 7 pm. I decided to call the Coast Guard at 1-855-406-8724 and an officer directed me to call the Coast Guard Miami Beach sector at 305-535-4472. I sent the Coast Guard information by text that I found on Google (a Federal Register document) that discussed the new test schedule for the 63rd Street bridge and that said the curfew only applies on the weekdays from Monday to Friday. It appears that the information was sent to the acting bridge supervisor and then passed on to the on-duty bridge operator who told me that a mistake had been made/admitted when they applied the curfew to the weekend. This information was provided to me by the bridge operator after I called her on my VHF radio in the late afternoon as I began to hear and see her granting requests to boats to open the 63rd Street bridge between 4 pm and 7 pm. Applying the weekday curfew to the weekend would be too restrictive, unreasonable and unfair to all of the boaters that live on the waterway south of the 63rd Street bridge that just want to go boating with their friends and families for a few hours in the morning or in the afternoon especially since there are no peak vehicular traffic periods on Saturdays and Sundays at any time in the morning or the afternoon. I wanted for you to be aware of what happened this past Sunday to me and many other boaters, and for you to have my opinion on the curfew matter in the event that this is something that is also proposed or requested by one or more private citizens in the future (i.e. applying the curfew that is in place during the weekdays to the weekend days also).  

Thank you very much for your time and attention to my comments above and to this matter.",,,,,,,

At times the bridge is up for 10+mins resulting in a massive inconvenience for 100s of cars, an increase in emissions and backed up traffic on Alton and Pine Tree that also further pollutes those homes atmospheres.  All this for one or two boats with 4-5 people in them (all likely wealthy due to size of boats that requiere the bridge to move). Presently I believe it opens once per half hour, how about hourly OR better yet a TOLL for the boats when it opens thereby Paying for maintenance which might make bridge run more efficiently or forcing boats to find alternative routes out to sea.  The situation needs to be addressed as it is a massive inconvenience to 100s of people for the pleasure of a few.  Thank you ",,,,,,,

I encourage the Coast Guard to permanently implement this schedule (or even a slightly expanded schedule) after the evaluation period, as it is already evident that these measures are effective, beneficial and necessary to improve traffic flow along Alton Road, Pinetree Drive and Indian Creek Drive. 

I would also like to take this opportunity to praise the Coast Guard for having previously implemented the Monday through Friday rush hour bridge lock-down schedule which has dramatically improved rush hour traffic flow along Alton Road, Pinetree Drive, and Indian Creek Drive.   That simple but important bridge schedule change has had an enormous positive effect on the quality of life of thousands of people daily, while at the same time greatly improving emergency response times for police,fire and life safety vehicles which were previously stuck in gridlock traffic jams every weekday morning and afternoon.

There is no reason for random openings.  
Scheduled openings are better for residents, boat captains ,and bridge operators.


 Scheduled openings allow residents to avoid spending 20 minutes waiting on bridges to run an errand a half a mile away.


Another bonus is  on weekdays business can run  more efficiently avoid wasting valuable time waiting for bridge.  A 10 minute errand often turns into an unpredictable 30 minutes .

The challenge for on demand is that the timing is unknown and allows for large boats (many of them are now charters) picking up speed upon suddenly seeing the bridge open when rounding the northern tip of our island.  Scheduled has led to the private boats and charters planning their departures and return and a safer route and less damage to the seawalls.  When on demand, the bridge operators would open and close the bridge within minutes of each other for multiple openings.  There was no reasoning to it and we would have several openings, especially on weekends within 10 or 15 minutes of each other. The bridge operator would not require boats to sit.

Also the siren blowing so hard make our lives miserable, specially during the weekends when the bridge can open every ten minutes.
There is also no maximum time for the bridge to be open, it happened several times that the operator waits for boats that are further north of Alison island, making the wait longer building up traffic on both ends.

The bridge currently opens on demand. This causes a lot of gridlock and traffic and many times 1 boat is holding up at least 80 cars and up to 200 people. Most of the people that are waiting for the bridge to close are working as opposed to 1-10 people that are going on a boat where waiting 30-45 is insignificant.

By have a schedule drivers in cars will know when they shouldn't cross the bridge and many boater will know the same thing.
I am a boater and have a boat and always check the bridge schedules to know when to travel.

I hope that is schedule for opening is done on the weekdays and weekends

Jet ski is a registered trademark of Kawasaki.  By specifying Jet skis, you fail to regulate WaveRunners (Yamaha), Sea-Doos (Bombardier Recreational Products), AquaTrax (Honda), and similar vessels.  All of these other brands could enter the parade route without violating the proposed regulation.

The appropriate term for these vessels is ""personal watercraft"" or PWCs.  Section 33 C.F.R.  173.3 provides this definition: ""Personal watercraft means a vessel propelled by a water-jet pump or other machinery as its primary source of motive power and designed to be operated by a person sitting, standing, or kneeling on the vessel, rather than sitting or standing within the vessel's hull.  See also: 33 C.F.R.  174.3 (identical definition);  327.02(36), Fla. Stat. (2020) (similar definition).

I recommend that you revise paragraph (b)(2) to read: ""Personal watercraft (Jet Skis, Sea-Doos, WaveRunners, etc.) and vessels without mechanical propulsion are prohibited from the parade route.""
