A steady stream of traffic uses the Beau Chen neighborhood in an attempt to avoid the Highway 22 backup, increasing safety concerns within that neighborhood. The intersection of Franco's/Beau Chen is often blocked by drivers that are tired of waiting for multiple lights and simply pull into the intersection and stop with nowhere to go.  This prevents the traffic with the green light traffic from proceeding, causing further delays and driver frustration. Drivers are making unsafe U-turns across all lanes to avoid the wait.  Any change that discourages the bridge from raising during peak traffic time is warranted for the safety and health of our community.",,,,,,,

My reasoning is as follows:
1) Eliminating the 7 am opening M-F will not have a significant impact on vehicular traffic flow as the bridge very rarely opens at 7 am M-F. This assessment is based on my review of bridge tender logs for the month of June 2021. Before this proposed rule is approved, a review of bridge tender logs for multiple months should be conducted to verify that having a 7am opening capability is actually causing vehicular traffic issues. 
2) eliminating the ability to open on the half hour M-F will similarly have minimal to no impact on vehicle traffic as the bridge rarely opens at all during the weekdays.  The exception may be on Fridays.  This is also based on the same bridge tender log review above.  Before approval, additional review of bridge tender logs should be conducted as above. 
3) As written, the rule actually reduced the time the bridge is closed to marine traffic during the evening rush hour (after 4pm until 6pm compared to the current restrictions which is closed to marine traffic after 3:30 pm until 6pm M-F).  This seems counter productive to the intent of this change. 
4) even if the proposed rule were updated to increase the evening rush hour closure to marine traffic from after 3pm until 7pm M-F this would have minimal positive impact on vehicular traffic as the bridge has minimal openings for marine traffic between 3pm and 4pm M-Th. Fridays present a slightly different picture. See bridge log comments above including need for additional review before approval. 
5) eliminating half hour opening on weekends WILL have an impact on both marine and vehicular traffic as weekends see the vast majority of marine traffic requiring bridge openings and weekend traffic is not much less than M-F evening rush hour traffic except it is practically all day instead of just evenings. 
6) what is the rationale to eliminate the exclusion for holidays if the intent is to improve rush hour traffic during the work days?
7) in general, the volume of vehicular traffic exceeds the capacity of the current roadways regardless of the operation of the bridge.  I suspect, admittedly without hard data to prove, that if the bridge was permanently closed to marine traffic, the vehicular traffic issues and backups would still persist on this corridor. 
8) the argument presented by the town concerning emergency response vehicles is moot as procedures, protocols, and rules currently exist that allow emergency responders to contact the bridge tender and keep the bridge closed to marine traffic if an emergency occurs that requires bridge crossing by emergency vehicles. 
9) Finally, as a boater, I can adjust my schedule to accommodate the proposed rule (or any similarly modified rule) with only a little inconvenience if it truly alleviates vehicular traffic congestion.  However, it would be very frustrating to see further restrictions placed on bridge operation as a “feel good” measure that will not actually alleviate the vehicle congestion.

This is a safety hazard on HWY 22 during rush hour periods.

Not only is this such an inconvenience for those trying to get home, get to work, or have kids in the car, it’s dangerous! Drivers are constantly cutting each other off, racing to get to the front of the line where the 2 lanes merge into 1 lane and drivers who are trying to get onto the road from their neighborhoods are almost hit because of drivers rushing through traffic.

Many Maryland boating laws existed before the MD Department of Natural Resources was created in 1969.  Adoption would be the catalyst for reorganizing those disparate provisions into a concise and orderly statute. 

I was one of two “observers” representing the National Association of State Boating Law Administrators (NASBLA) during the Uniform Law Commission (ULC) study process.  I was asked to participate because my state (Maryland) registers vessels through our Department of Natural Resources.  The other NASBLA observer was asked to participate because his state (Florida) registers vessels through their Motor Vehicle Administration.  I also represented NASBLA at the national ULC meeting where the UCOTVA was formally adopted.

The ULC study process was extremely thorough.  As observers, we were an integral part of that process.  Committee members gave full attention to our objections, suggestions, and experiences.  We were full participants in the process – not merely observers as our committee designation would lead you to believe.
  
The Coast Guard’s adoption will be a huge benefit for Maryland vessel owners.

On behalf of the Michigan Boating Industries Association (“MBIA”), we are writing in response to the Coast Guard’s proposed rule on the Uniform Certificate of Title for Vessels Act (“UCOTVA”) published in the September 22, 2021, Federal Register. The MBIA understands the benefits of the proposed rule, which would certify UCOTVA and in turn confer preferred mortgage status on financial instruments that apply to undocumented vessels. The proposed rule would also incorporate UCOTVA’s title branding provision, a crucial consumer protection measure, which requires a seller to disclose hull damage to potential purchasers of a vessel. However, we are concerned that there may be an inconsistency in granting preferred mortgage status on titled watercraft and the provisions of Section 187.324 which indicate that “the effect of perfection and non-perfection of a security interest and the priority of a perfected or unperfected security interest with respect to the rights of a purchaser or creditor, including a lien creditor, is governed by State law.” Once certification occurs, the security interest perfected under that state law will be given preferred mortgage status under federal law and therefore preempt state law regarding lien creditors.  In other words, mechanics liens and storage liens, which might have had certain priority under state law, will now lose that priority if the repair or storage occurs after the security interest is perfected. This should be considered before certification occurs as it will be a dramatic change in how storage and repair facilities do business. Under the circumstances, we cannot support the certification by the Coast Guard until there is an answer whereby the certification does not strip repair and storage facilities of their lien rights under state law once the certification occurs. Therefore, we would oppose the proposed rule making.

Michigan Boating Industries Association is a state-wide, non-profit marine trade association which represents more than 350 marine businesses in the state of Michigan. Michigan is the third largest boat market in the country and the boating industry has a $7.8 billion economic impact on the Michigan's economy annually.

However, the rule fails to acknowledge those towing vessels on any waters, over 15 gt, carrying cargo for hire, that would also fall under Subchapter I and should be called out in this rulemaking.  This represents a sizeable portion of the population currently thought to be Subchapter M vessels by both CG inspectors and industry, mostly due to ignorance of the applicability or of vessel operations, such as fleeting vessels carrying supplies, vessels providing rig tending or maintenance services, etc.  

2) CG inspection under Subchapter M was never intended to be open for anyone that chose it, but was instead recommended by ABSG as a limited alternative for small companies that could not afford to maintain an SMS (Sub M NPRM, FR Vol 76, No. 155/Thursday, August 11, 2011, pg 49979).  This was amended in the Final Rule to be open for choice to anyone, resulting in concern that the CG may not have the resources to address the new workload.  Although the proposed fees are substantially different than previous, they may not differ enough between options to provide the desired incentive for vessels to choose the TSMS compliance option in that the difference does not adequately offset the costs of maintaining the TSMS.  Those costs include audits, surveys, and administrative costs, costs of membership (per vessel) to trade organizations to use their SMS template, additional TPO interaction costs caused by marine casualties or CG OCMI orders, etc.",,,,,,,

These include but are not limited to the presence of shifting ice that may need to be avoided, moving concentrations of whales or other protected marine mammals that should be avoided and changing areas of subsistence activity conducted by indigenous people in the neighboring regions.  There are also ATBAs that should be established for areas where the hazard or environmental issues are stabilized in their current location. 

The PARS should also offer various routes to accommodate the dynamic presence of ice that in some cases will make a route less viable than another due to the ice class of a vessel.   

Additionally, ensuring vessels can receive and process shore generated reports of dynamic marine protected areas, safety zones during subsistence operations, ice conditions and other hazards via AIS and other communications systems needs to addressed in the Arctic PARS process..

I am in support of sections of the new proposal. I feel the bridge signal sound do pose a noise issue but, for safety  think the bells to cease persons from walking are necessary. I do not object to extending the rush hour bridge closures to help alleviate tragic congestion. The bridge operation hours are acceptable. Our concern is a two hour notice to open or close. This was tried last year on the Menominee River in Milwaukee. It did not work and many boaters suffered being trapped on their vessels with no place to safely tie off. As boaters we are not guaranteed full sun shine or calm wind and can say to predict a two hour window for a bridge opening is just not feasible. To say this was initiated by One alderman receiving Several complaints about the bridge signals it has accumulated to a proposal to limit boaters rights away. Again I am shamed by our governments willingness to curb our rights. I hope you take this into consideration. Mike Johnson",,,,,,,

 There are many businesses along the Milwaukee River that benefit from recreational and commercial passenger boat traffic. Placing a two hour notice on the mariner to pass through a bridge will economically impact business above the Michigan Ave. Bridge.

I suggest that the bridges between Michigan Ave. and W. Juneau open on a predetermined schedule. One possibility is 10 minute intervals; this would allow each bridge to open once per hour. Openings would not be needed if there is no vessel traffic is present. Bridge operators would also be visiting each bridge once an hour, an added benefit of increased security.

Finally, along the Kinnickinnic River, the Canadian Pacific Swing Bridge mile 1.67 and the 1st Street Bridge, mile 1.78 need to have the same operating schedule as the Kinnickinnic Ave. bridge, mile 1.5. This is to allow passage of masted navigation to old and new businesses above 1st street along the Kinnickinnic River and prevent a vessel from becoming trapped between 1st Street and Kinnickinnic Ave.

Specifically, the Coast Guard has proposed the draft PARS that examines the approaches to the Chesapeake Bay, in conjunction with the implementation of recommendations of the Atlantic Coast-PARS within an area that extends approximately 220 nautical miles seaward of the Chesapeake Bay, between Ocean City, Maryland, and Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. The purpose of the study is to provide information on potential traffic density and the need for safe access routes for vessels.

Please be advised that the Virginia Marine Resources Commission (VMRC) pursuant to Chapters 12, 13, and 14 of Title 28.2 of the Code of Virginia administers permits required for submerged lands, tidal wetlands, and beaches and dunes. We have reviewed the provided documents and have concluded that the proposed Chesapeake Bay approaches 
should not negatively affect the VMRC's enforceable policies of Virginia's Coastal Zone Management Program, which include fisheries management, subaqueous lands, tidal wetlands, and coastal primary sand dunes and beaches. Should the proposed access routes change, a new review by this agency may be required relative to these jurisdictional areas.

BNSF modeled this stewardship by doing the right thing to to resolve the diesel fuel spill in Mandan.  Many businesses in the Bismarck-Mandan area continue to lease land from BNSF property adjacent to the rail line.  This give and take relationship can and has worked well for decades through a desire and willingness to work together.

Lover of old bridges.  So I am distressed to see the BNSF's plans to demolish this imposing structure.  The antique truss bridges are becoming endangered species, even relatively modern ones like this rivet jointed structure.

But there are mitigating factors working in BNSF's favor - and I don't mean the things like ice dams and other ""problems"" they mention. These sound like make-weight arguments.  No, mynconcern would be the future responsibility for the structure if the railroad leaves it standing.  Who will be responsible for maintaining it?  What practical use would it have - the population in that area is very sparse and the climate mean so bike or hiking trails would not seem to be very widely used.  

So, I'd say the railroad gets the nod with the information at hand.  BTW if there's a nice little pony truss somewhere in there I'd be happy to take it delivered intact FOB our farm in NW MO!",,,,,,,

This bridge presents the citizens of ND and residents to Bismarck-Mandan an opportunity to preserve an artifact of its settlement history AND to gain a valuable recreational asset in the form of a river crossing for bicyclists, runners, and pedestrians.

BNSF is willing to spend $60 million and not ask the tax payers to share the burden.  The risk of allowing traffic on the part of aging infrastructure has greater potential for negative environmental impact than the construction of a replacement could ever have.

With raw steel prices at $75/ton, it is time to dismantle the old bridge and build a modern, safe bridge with ultra heavy load bearing components. I'd also like to ask about why the public didn't object to the old Memorial bridge demolition back several years ago, but rather, thousands of people came out to witness the demolition of that bridge. The new Memorial bridge is outstanding, constructed with modern engineering! So too, can the NEW BNSF bridge be! Let us not delay any longer since the cost of materials today will be less than tomorrow. Besides, BNSF is footing the bill by themselves, NOT taxpayer money, as would be, if the Bismarck Park Board ever gets involved again. In closing, Mr. Thompson should be recusing himself from any park board decisions pertaining to this project since he sits on this FORB committee.",,,,,,,

It brought settlers to western ND to farm and ranch, new cities and towns, creation of a new economy and wealth as well as the wealthy east coast visitors enticed to see the Old West. These are the stories that make ND a state stacked with rich history of Native American culture, forts and military, farmers and ranchers, and the hard working folks that have made ND an outstanding state in the union. 

 

If it were not for this bridge opening during the time that it did, Theodore Roosevelt would have never made it to the Badlands. “I never would have been President were it not for my experiences in North Dakota.” Theodore Roosevelt. Ask your self, if he would have never become president of the United States, would we be where we are today? He remains the youngest person to become President of the United States. Roosevelt was a leader of the progressive movement and championed his ""Square Deal"" domestic policies, promising the average citizen fairness, breaking of trusts, regulation of railroads, and pure food and drugs. His presidency saw the passage of the Pure Food and Drug Act, which established the Food and Drug Administration to regulate food safety, and the Hepburn Act, which increased the regulatory power of the Interstate Commerce Commission. Roosevelt established the United States Forest Service, signed into law the creation of five National Parks, and signed the 1906 Antiquities Act, under which he proclaimed 18 new U.S. National Monuments. He also established the first 51 bird reserves, four game preserves, and 150 National Forests. The area of the United States that he placed under public protection totals approximately 230 million acres.

 

Ask yourself, how long would it have taken for a Food & Drug Admiration to be formed to protect our food or a US Forest Service to be formed before all our wildlife would have been hunted to extinction? The answer...too late.

 

I love this bridge because it represents the my heritage; my 23 year-old Norwegian great-grandmother came to America for a better life and settling land herself in western ND. I love this bridge because it is the first thing you see when you Google Bismarck, ND.  I love it because it represents unprecedented architecture that has stood for over 130 years, what a gift to keep it's history alive. Oh the stories it could tell. I love this bridge because the sunsets through it are a window to heaven (photos courtesy of KyleMartinPhoto-who is a dear friend of mine). I love that it's history is older that one of the most iconic and recognizable metal structures in the world, the Eifel Tower. I love to see it everyday as I drive to work. I embrace history and want to preserve this amazing piece of Dakota Territory. 

Please consider saving this iconic piece of Western American history and the legacy it holds for uniting the west coast to the east coast. Thank you!",,,,,,"https://downloads.regulations.gov/USCG-2019-0882-0412/attachment_4.jpg,https://downloads.regulations.gov/USCG-2019-0882-0412/attachment_4.pdf,https://downloads.regulations.gov/USCG-2019-0882-0412/attachment_3.jpg,https://downloads.regulations.gov/USCG-2019-0882-0412/attachment_3.pdf,https://downloads.regulations.gov/USCG-2019-0882-0412/attachment_1.pdf,https://downloads.regulations.gov/USCG-2019-0882-0412/attachment_1.jpg,https://downloads.regulations.gov/USCG-2019-0882-0412/attachment_2.pdf,https://downloads.regulations.gov/USCG-2019-0882-0412/attachment_2.jpg",

While this EIS mentions impacts to visual, recreational and habitat concerns, it is my opinion that the permitting process must spell out mitigation measures. I believe the general public--even those who support efficient transportation systems and economic growth--has serious concerns about these impacts and essential mitigation measures. The trails, the trees, the wildlife, the recreational navigation along the Missouri River are all fundamental components in this region. Unless this portion of the process delineates mitigation regarding the existing bridge, the impact on public recreation, and other social impacts, this EIS is woefully inadequate.",,,,,,"https://downloads.regulations.gov/USCG-2019-0882-0428/attachment_1.docx",

The permitting process must spell out mitigation measures. I believe the general public--even those who support efficient transportation systems and economic growth--has serious concerns about these impacts and essential mitigation measures. The trails, the trees, the wildlife, the recreational navigation along the Missouri River are all fundamental components in this region. Unless this portion of the process delineates mitigation regarding the existing bridge, the impact on public recreation, and other social impacts, the Environmental Impact Statement is woefully inadequate.",,,,,,,

They are below:

•	Three appraisals from three disparate, unbiased (not on the payroll of BNSF) commercial appraisers should be pursued (much in the way one would pursue three quotes for a project);

•	The 1884 Northern Pacific Railroad report contains the cost for labor and material expenses for construction of the original NPRR Bridge. The original 1883 piers remain intact. Adjustments would likely be needed for the 1905 superstructure replacement. Once the cost of the original bridge labor and materials is found, the original costs should be adjusted for inflation at a value commensurate for the year 2021. This can be done using an inflation calculator. 

The following report, which is contained in the archives of the State Historical Society of North Dakota (Bismarck) and the Minnesota Historical Society (St. Paul), is the one that contains this necessary information. See George S. Morison, Bismarck Bridge: A Report to A. Anderson Engineer in Chief Northern Pacific Railroad, 1884. Detailed illustrations accompany Morison’s narrative of bridge construction and costs of labor and materials.

My name is Amy Guthrie Sakariassen, I am a resident of Bismarck and deeply involved with efforts to find a pathway to preservation for the stately and beloved Bismarck Rail Bridge, identified in context of the current Draft EIS as Bridge 196.6.  I am a preservation advocate and have been a regional advisor to the National Trust for Historic Preservation for more than a decade. I am the present chairperson of the City of Bismarck’s Historic Preservation Commission, and I sit on the city’s Forestry Advisory Board. My background is in Archaeology. I am a Cultural Resource Specialist by profession and a trained Paleontological Preparator. I am also a permitted Paleontologist, with many years of experience working with fossil preparation in laboratory settings and with field excavation in this state and in Montana.  
My comments here, for the most part, will deal with the failure of the Draft EIS creator, Jacobs Engineering, and their employer, BNSF, to obtain meaningful and requisite participation of at least one critical federal and state agency.  Although the geology of the specific project area was addressed superficially by reference to Ed Murphy’s article in North Dakota History, which focused on the history of the rail bridge and the significant geologic complications that led to slippage and slumping of the river bank, it appears no effort was made to contact the United States Geologic Survey Office in Bismarck. Ed Murphy, author of the paper, is currently the State Geologist.  Nor was effort made to contact Dr. Clint Boyd, North Dakota’s State Paleontologist. Had this requisite contact been made through channels normally followed in the creation of a responsible EIS, certain facts would be in that document.  Both of these men are easily reached and yet they were not approached by BNSF’s consultant for their professional input on the project in question.  If the correct protocol had been taken, the existence of a paleontological site within the quarter section which includes the east bluff around the bridge approach and tracks would have been noted in the Draft EIS. Clearly, this fact has been neatly avoided, although the geologic specifics of the east side Missouri River banks are easy to find and these bluffs known to be fossil bearing.  Any novice should have been alert to the potential for fossil resources to be encountered with the extensive construction and earthwork detailed for the proposed new BNSF rail approaches and bridge.  Jacobs should be ashamed of this omission. And BNSF must accept responsibility for mitigation or avoidance of this recorded paleontological site.  It is of great concern to me, considering the alarming extent of the reconfiguration of the bluff and approaches of a new structure, that fragile and potentially informative fossil resources have been excluded in this document. 
The lead Draft EIS failed to obtain meaningful participation from agencies that have jurisdiction by law or special expertise with respect to the environmental impacts caused by or related to the proposed project. Consequently, this document fails to adequately address environmental impacts that EPA is responsible for reviewing and enforcing, including how the project will affect a known paleontological site on the bluff on the east side of the river.

I am a long-time resident of Bismarck/Mandan and my absolute favorite thing to do in the summers is to hang out on the river. My favorite spot is right next to the train bridge. I go at every opportunity. Sometimes I sit on the bank and read enjoying the scenery and the sound of the water. Other times I will be there doing yoga and listening to music. I often chat with strangers that walk their dogs past me. I get to watch young kids fish off the rocks and goof around with their buddies. I dive with my friends into the channel from the edge of the sandbar to cool off. Just this week for the first time I was able to dive into the channel with flippers on and swim out to touch one of the rail bridge’s piers! It was an amazing experience paddling hard to reach it in time, reaching out and touching the stone as the river rushed us past, getting to see the marks of creation left on the rock. I cannot wait to do it again.
My comment for the EIS is that this draft does not address how the project will impact the ability of the public to access the riverbanks for recreation. The riverbanks around the bridge provide some of the only free public spots to play and relax in the water during the overwhelming heat of the summer. I know work must be done in the area to save the bridge for our future use, but the EIS must address the social and economic impact closing the beaches will have on the people of Bismarck/Mandan. We need access to the river. We need this place. It is important to us, do the right thing.

FORB is a not-for-profit entity formed to protect the still-in-use Landmark 1883 Railway Bridge at the historically important Missouri River Crossing between Bismarck and Mandan, North Dakota. FORB gathered more than 6,000 signatures of persons from the Bismarck-Mandan Community within weeks of the announcement that the 1883 Railway Bridge might be destroyed and replaced. FORB has been actively involved under the National Historic Preservation Act and the National Environmental Policy Act processes relating to the proposed destruction and replacement of the 1883 Railway Bridge. FORB has performed and presented multiple analyses and other proposals, including converting of the bridge for pedestrian use and other options that have been raised in consulting party meetings in these proceedings. These comments are a continuation of that participation. This first attached document summarizes FORB’s general concerns with this Draft EIS. Specific examples of concerns are in another attached document that references sections and pages of the Draft EIS.  In addition FORB retained an engineering consultant to perform a review of the hydraulic modeling efforts associated with the proposed action. Comments have been presented to the US Coast Guard previously but have not been addressed formally. The attached memorandum includes three technical observations regarding the information presented to FEMA with the CLOMR (page 1) and six conclusions regarding an alternative which would preserve the existing historic rail bridge. In addition FORB is sharing the feasibility report by North Dakota State University previously given to the US Coast Guard, which also was not formally considered, showing that conversation of the rail bridge into a recreational trail is a viable alternative worthy of consideration. A memorandum summarizing a two-dimensional modeling analysis shows preservation of the historic bridge as a companion to a new bridge would cause less than 0.003-feet of flooding, a negligible impact.

In summary, the DRAFT EIS is deeply flawed and does not satisfy the requirements of NEPA and the longstanding requirements of CEQ's implementing regulations. These flaws must be corrected in the final EIS to meet the longstanding legal requirements that apply.

From the beginning, consultation has dismissed the no-action alternative out of hand, never giving it the serious consideration it deserves. Instead, BNSF and their consultant, Jacobs Engineering, have employed distractive fallacy, making a strawman of the local effort to retain and convert the historic bridge to a recreational trail. 
As a lifelong resident of Bismarck, I know a bit about the railroad and the history of its bridge. My great-grandfather arrived from Denmark in the 1880s, settling in Mandan, where he made a career working for the Northern Pacific, the company that eventually became BNSF. As a child, I heard my great aunt tell of the winter of 1882 when the railroad laid tracks directly on the ice to carry trains west from the Missouri River. Her father arrived in Dakota Territory in the 1870s as a wood hawk for the steamboat companies and worked as a laborer on the construction of the bridge.
I also know a bit about transportation. My family owned a book and magazine wholesale company for almost 100 years. At its peak, it was a good-sized small business, grossing $12 million annually and employing 75 people in North Dakota and Minnesota. We ran a dozen truck routes that supplied 700 retail customers. Believe me, there are limits to rail transport. A freight train can’t back up to a Walmart loading dock to deliver a pallet of merchandise.
In retirement, I’ve been a development officer for the Fort Abraham Lincoln Foundation, raising funds to build a visitor center just north of the rail bridge. The foundation supports heritage tourism and education in the Northern Plains National Heritage Area. It owns and operates a commercial vessel, the Lewis & Clark Riverboat, and was asked to participate as a consulting party. In that capacity, I have attended the consulting meetings that led to this DEIS.
BNSF says the new bridge is just part of a system-wide replacement policy. They say it’s reached the end of its useful life and expect the public to take them at their word. Of course the existing bridge is structurally sound, verified by regular inspections that allow its current use. If it were in danger of failing, BNSF wouldn’t run trains across it. 
The historic rail bridge was named by the National Trust for Historic Preservation to its 2019 list of America’s 11 Most Endangered Historic Places. This is no small distinction. The annual listing has drawn national attention to threatened American treasures such as Ellis Island, Walden Pond, and Mesa Verde. At a recent consulting meeting, the North Dakota SHPO stated that not only is the bridge eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places, but would qualify for designation as a National Historic Landmark.
Still, BNSF representatives have stymied any serious consideration of a preservation alternative. They have displayed an arrogant sense of entitlement, as if the process were nothing more than a regulatory nuisance. They have lobbied against preservation efforts and applied political pressure to dissuade governing bodies from endorsing or participating in any outcome that would save the historic bridge. They suggest that only a small group of people are working to save the bridge. In truth, over 5,000 people have signed a petition in its support. (See the petition attached).
The Missouri River is a navigable waterway. It is not owned by BNSF, but rather is held in trust for the American people. BNSF has been granted an easement to cross the river, but that easement is a privilege, not a right. NHPA and NEPA exist to thoroughly examine potential effects of any proposed project with a federal nexus. The process should be exhaustive not automatic. It should not operate under a predetermined outcome.
The American people have a say in the USCG record of decision. It is predicated not only on US law and the permitting authority of the lead federal agency. There is a moral and ethical responsibility of the railroad to the citizens from which it owes its existence. The United States created the Northern Pacific Railroad through Congressional Charter in 1864. The US Government established a private corporation for “the good of the people,” granting 40 million acres of public land to the railroad, land it could sell back to the public to raise funds for its construction. The bridge was the linchpin in the railroad’s completion. It stands as a monumental engineering achievement. It holds profound significance in the American landscape. It is a national treasure and an iconic landmark. BNSF has failed to make a convincing argument for its destruction. Until they do, I urge you to rule in favor of the no-action alternative.

Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the Draft Environmental Impact Statement. I appreciate the opportunity. 
As long as any resident of North Dakota has been alive, the railroad bridge over the Missouri River has been a part of our environment. Indeed, that bridge changed the course of history. The rail bridge has been the backdrop of life events of not only North Dakotans, but of people from all over the U.S.A. and even other parts of the world. This is an icon to people who live here, and the proposed preferred alternative looks utilitarian and flat. If the plans to build a new bridge and tear down the old bridge continue as planned, it will change the visual, social and historical environment of this place. I urge the federal agencies to account for how those changes will impact the people of these cities, this state, and the nation. I also urge another review of the alternative that leaves the current bridge in place; it can serve as a pedestrian and bicycle crossing, a place for gathering, and continue on in the backdrop of our lives. 

When a corporation proposed to change our environment, good care should be taken to preserve the environment. I find this environmental impact statement lacking in consideration for how the bridge changes our environment; it is lacking in mentioning how the newer standards for lighting will impact the people living near the bridge and the people who look to the stars for inspiration and for being able to view the stars, planets, and other celestial bodies as their position changes relatively to earth with the seasons. I do not see projections of how larger and heavier trains through the cities of Bismarck and Mandan will impact the people living nearby who will experience likely greater levels of sound (horns and engines). I do not see in this impact statement for how the BNSF will replace trees that are removed for this project. And I did not read about consultations with historical organizations about how the project may impact potential archeological sites in the area. I do not see in the analysis how this project will contribute to reducing pollution and energy use, or how this contributes to a smaller environmental footprint for the railroad, the state, or the nation. I write at a time when global climate change is contributing to larger, more frequent and more intense storms, changes in weather patterns, and increased wild fires. The temperature in Bismarck, ND is expected to reach 105 degrees F, and smoke, haze and particulates from forest fires across Western U.S. and Canada are floating in the air here. How can we continue on this course, as if nothing is happening?
Thank you for the consideration of these comments.

This is a false and misleading statement and unreferenced. Native American communities were definitely impacted by Indian policies during the first part of the 20th century. The Winters Doctrine, an outcome of the 1907 Supreme Court decision in Winters v. United States established Indian water rights. Native Americans did not get the right to vote until 1924 and the passage of the Snyder Act. The Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 sought to curtail further allotment of tribal communal lands that was authorized by the Dawes Act of 1887 he return of surplus lands within reservations to tribes rather than to homesteaders. The act encouraged tribes to pass written constitutions and charters that would give tribes power to manage their internal affairs. These are only a few examples of how Native Americans were impacted by Indian policies of the government, both positive and negative. Tribes have always been subject to decisions of Congress and the courts.",,,,,,,

U.S. Coast Guard
Attn: Rob McCaskey
1222 Spruce Street
St Louis, MO  63103

Dear Mr. McCaskey,

As North Dakota’s voice for the more than 13,000 corn growers across the state, we contact you today in support of the proposed BNSF railway bridge across the Missouri River between Bismarck and Mandan, North Dakota and to offer commentary on the Draft Environmental Impact Statement.
Uniquely situated in the middle upper Midwest, North Dakota farmers are key suppliers of agricultural products that feed our country and the world.  Our natural geographic location does not afford us proximity to the country’s primary inland waterways system.  Transportation costs are a significant part of the input costs for us and the buyers of our corn.   Therefore, we largely get our products to market by surface transportation and rail service is a primary means to send our corn to the Pacific Northwest.

The current bridge must be replaced for the rail provider to maintain safe and efficient transportation service for our ag products.  Agriculture products comprise a large part of the freight that transverses the bridge with about 14 trains a day.  And we expect that with more value-added agriculture each year, the demand for rail service to the PNW will only exponentially increase. With weight and speed restrictions, that means increased number of trains.  We want to ensure the infrastructure in the future will be reliable and affordable to get our product to market.  

Significant delays and cost increases caused by alternative proposals will undoubtably be passed on and negatively affect rail customers.  Our country ag producers need to remain competitive.  Every day our industry monitors our key global competitors ag exports, and as they get more efficient, we cannot afford to fall behind.  The ripple effect caused by such increased costs and reduced efficiency would certainly adversely affect not only our producers, but US consumers as well.

We ask that the Coast Guard issue the requested permit for BNSF’s planned project without further delay.  We appreciate your consideration of our request and the impact it would have on us. Please don’t hesitate to contact us with any questions.  Thank you.

Sincerely, 



Rob Hanson, President 
North Dakota Corn Growers Association

Although safety is a big concern, I do think that the option to have a remote control center is a smart and useful idea. There was a concern about how there was going to be maintenance checks, repairs, etc. In order to help with that, they could have regular maintenance checks on the drawbridge to help make sure everything is running correctly. They have done a lot of testing and experimenting on this new system and there have been no flaws so far.

Weather situations in that part of Alabama could call for an eventual remote control center one day in the interest of safety. However, with a remote control center, there is always a risk of malfunctions or negligence. So far, there have been no hiccups in testing so I am confident in the proposal.

Most of the world operates remotely already. Eventually, operations that were once operated manually could very well be done remotely. It is probably more efficient for the drawbridge operator. The job of the operator could be taxing and time consuming as well. This remote feature could possibly eliminate some of these factors. I am not against this proposed regulation, however I do have some concerns in regards to this matter. In the event that the bridge is in need of operation and the remote feature possibly displays a malfunction, the time that the operator could have been in preparation to operate the bridge manually is now wasted. I would suggest that the remote operation and the manual operation be split up. If there is a potential emergency, the bridge may need to be operated manually instead of remotely. All in all, I believe this is an idea that may potentially help other operators as well. ",,,,,,,

Most of the world operates remotely already. Eventually, operations that were once operated manually could very well be done remotely. It is probably more efficient for the drawbridge operator. The job of the operator could be taxing and time consuming as well. This remote feature could possibly cut down on those efforts when it comes to extreme events that may occur. I am not against this proposed regulation, however I do have a couple concerns. In the event that there is an event that the bridge needs to be operated on, what if there is a malfunction with the remote option. The time that the bridge operator could be making preparations to operate the bridge, it is now being wasted due to that malfunction. I would say to maybe split up the remote operation and the manual operation. In the event that an operator is desperately needed, I suggest that someone do it manually.   ",,,,,,,

Safety is a concern in addition to keeping the flow of boats moving. 
Most boaters have no idea who to contact or how to voice concerns. I have a contact who keeps us informed but not everyone has that connection. 
Please do not remove the human bridgetender on the bridges and please do not change to remote operation of these bridges! 
There are hazards – rocks, river current, car, boat and pedestrian traffic. Keeping boats waiting for an opening, causes boaters to hold position dealing with these hazards and as more boats approach, this becomes more difficult. It is my opinion that remote operation will not be as effective as keeping bridgetenders on each bridge.
A bridgetender can regulate boat traffic flow much better than remote operation. Each bridge needs a human who is focused on traffic and hazards for each bridge. 
It is also helpful for boaters to be able to communicate to the bridgetender on the bridge (RR bridge included). Responding to boaters regarding long waits, or when opening will occur, due to bridge walkers/gawkers or other reasons, is helpful to boaters. 
The railroad bridge is especially a slowdown and often an annoyance for boat traffic. At times, the bridge is closing when there are a few boats approaching the bridge and the closing could be held for a minute or two to allow traffic to flow through. There have been times with an impending storm, that getting into the safety of the river and closer to homeport would improve safety vs holding boats waiting.
Also, this human at the bridge should be allowed to recommend opening the bridge for a minute or two to allow traffic stuck between the RR bridge and the Main Street Bridge which can be important in high wind and or high traffic times. It becomes dangerous for boaters – especially larger boats – when its windy with high traffic, while trying to maneuver in that small space, while waiting for an opening.
Keeping the RR bridge closed for extended times causes the larger boats to burn unplanned fuel and maneuvering a large boat in wind is difficult – it’s not like being in a car on the road and waiting for the RR safety arms to lift.  
Please be more considerate of boaters and their safety.
Let’s keep safety in mind and promote smooth and timely openings. If boaters are annoyed by this high traffic river, compromised by delayed openings, the word will get out and visiting boaters will go elsewhere and that can affect the businesses who rely on boaters for their livelihood.
Thank you for your consideration.

The administrative management of the various required documents for our mariners has become a considerable burden to them as well as the companies that employ them.  The 5 year medical card option would/could align with the mariners credential/license, therefore making it possible to consolidate all phases of the renewal process.

Furthermore, the overall risk of a marine incident on navigable waters due to a Pilot's or a Masters medical condition is relatively low. 

This US Coast Guard proposal is a good step in the right direction towards a practical and common sense approach to a mariners administrative/medical requirements.

Secondly, as the average age in the industry increases along with the physical ailments and limitations, we need to maintain our professional standards. Not only for those aboard, but for those ashore, who may be effected by an errant pilot decision or incapacitation at an inopportune moment. We need to be cognizant of the stresses on the body, not just of the actual pilotage job description but also of the actions taken to get aboard a vessel. ie heaving pilot boats alongside, swinging pilot ladders, long strenous vertical climbs, not to mention the hours. 

The actual physical is only a few hours long and should be considered part of requirements of the job. ",,,,,,,

Collections of components in 'Classified' (note not listed) or 'U' components into enclosures and systems that are themselves only component listed is a potential ignition source. The requirements of API RP 14F/FZ (incorporated by reference) clearly state a temperature class to be marked on the equipment (assemblies) - This type of component collection has not been assessed for heat rise and it is therefore not able to prove it is a potential ignition source or not. Mitigation has been used that 'below 100oC does not need a T class' as per 'NEC' codes - but if this is a component certified installation ('Classified'/'U') then it could not be known that the temperature will not breach 100oC. The USCG  ACP policy letter has been utilized to grey these requirements suggesting IECEx and 'NEC' equipment can be mixed but the understanding of the intent of this was not for discrete assemblies but for packages/modules/vessels  - mixing different protection techniques in discrete assemblies without competent engineering due diligence could potentially produce ignition capable installations. These regulatory requirements are slipping detection as the Class inspection is too far into the project delivery chain and the resolution required to detect these discrete/granular non conformances is not possible - The detection and correction works at the specification/shipyard/pre commissioning/FAT/SAT phases. The proposal is to consider highlighting the requirement for assembly/package verification to aid industry in managing ignition sources throughout the value chain (to reduce the cost of major correction works which can run into $MM's). Assembly verification also applies to ordinary location equipment - The deliverables are detailed within existing standards incorporated by reference but detection is not working due to a lack of HazLoc awareness/knowledge/competency - additional relevant standards include ANSI/UL 698A, IEC TS 60079-46, ANSI/UL 508A (OrdLoc), UL2011.

EN14744 is the only standard to address LEDs directly for End of Life degradation and set a standard For EMI. For the USCG to restrict its use to only inspected vessels greater than twenty meters will only add confusion much as has been the case with the MTN 18-01.

CFR Reference: §110.10-1(k)(17)
Comment: The changes proposed do not change the reference to IEC 60092:302.  IEC 60092-302:1997 is listed as withdrawn and replaced by a 2019 edition of the same standard that aligns with release of the IEC 61439 set of standards. We recommend updating the reference to IEC 60092-302 as it aligns with the general direction the proposed changes to 46 CFR.

Rule Change: 29
CFR Reference: §111.30-5
Comment: IEEE 45.7-2012 Section 6.3.3 requires a steering gear breaker trip set to not less than 200% of locked rotor current. This conflicts with 46CFR §58.25-55(2) which requires a trip setpoint between 175 and 200% of locked rotor current.  
We recommend adding clarifying language to the rule to address this conflict.

Rule Change: 30
CFR Reference: §111.30-19(1)
Comment: Section 5.10 of IEEE 45.7-2012 appears to have less strict requirements for generator bus sizing compared to the equivalent IEEE45:2002 section and could be interpreted to not require sizing to support overload operation of the generator for a sustained period.
We recommend reviewing the proposed rule change and adding a clarifying note that bus bar sizing should account for overload ratings, if any. 

Rule Change: 32
CFR Reference: §111.30-25
Comment: The proposed changes do not include paragraph (3) which requires installation of a generator field rheostat (Manual Voltage Controller). This equipment is not required by other regulatory bodies, and we believe the practical usage of manual voltage controllers following failure of an AVR is limited. We suggest that the requirements of paragraph (c) be reviewed and removed or modified to allow for the requirement to be waived where there is sufficient redundancy in ship service generators to meet minimum maneuverability and habitability loads with one generator out of service.

Rule Change: 36(b)
CFR Reference: §111.33-3(a)(1)
Comment: Section 4.31.19.12 of IEEE 45.2 is explicitly for rectifiers. We suggest that all references to this section include a clarification that the requirements are generally applicable to converters to align with other revisions of Subpart 111.33

CFR Reference: §111.40-1
Comment: Section 9.10 of IEEE 45.1 includes multiple sub-sections. Only subsection 9.10.1 is directly applicable to panelboards, we suggest updating the reference to only include this subsection.

Rule Change: 44
CFR Reference: §115.50-3
Comment: The reference to 46CFR §115 is assumed to be a typo. This change should state that it is amending § 111.50-3

Rule Change: 48
CFR Reference: §111.51-1
Comment: The term ""continuity of service"" is not defined and could be interpreted in a number of ways. We suggest that the term be clearly defined.  For example, does this require that the specific loads be unaffected, or that standby devices could start to provide the service.  We assume that the continuity of service is not intended to require uninterrupted service.

Rule Change: 48
CFR Reference: §111.51-5(b)(2)
Comment: There are often cases where multiple protective devices are directly in series due to the arrangement of the power system and vendor equipment supply, or requirements for disconnecting devices.  This rule could be interpreted to require explicit coordination between protective devices within the same feeder or branch circuit.  We recommend editing the rule to allow for this arrangement or to define that a protective device refers to a set of one or more protective devices which protect the same segment of the electrical system.

Rule Change: 55
CFR Reference: §111.60-3
Comment: Removal of this section eliminates the ability to use special cables which cannot pass the flame tests required by §111.60-1. This change appears to be overly restrictive and not aligned with the goals stated in Part C of the preamble to these proposed changes. Cable for specialized applications such as scientific research instruments, passenger ferry Wi-Fi networks, etc. is sometimes not available or cost prohibitive to meet the fire test requirements.  We recommend retaining §111.60-3 largely as written, through a limitation on the types of systems to which this section applies would be reasonable.

Rule Change: 56
CFR Reference: §111.60-4
Comment: The required minimum conductor size of 0.82mm2 and 2.1mm2 for control and power cable respectively is unchanged. We note that vessels inspected under ACP have a lesser requirement (minimum conductor sizes of 0.75mm2 and 1.5mm2 respectively). We recommend decreasing the metric size requirements to match the requirements applicable to ACP vessels. This will eliminate the need to excessively oversize metric cable to meet the rules which are currently written to align with common AWG sizes, but not common metric sizes.",,,,,,,

Comment: The reference to Section 5.7 of IEEE 45.8-2016 does not address wire. There appears to be no equivalent to the previously reference section of IEEE45:2002 in IEEE 45.8. We recommend maintaining the original reference or directly introducing the MIL standard references listed in IEEE45:2002. (see below): ""component insulated wiring should be selected from a recognized commercial standard or military specification MIL-W-16878 or MIL-W-22759, with particular attention to the effects of vibration, moisture, ambient temperature, and other adverse conditions such as contaminants and oils, which may be present.""

Comment: The wording used appears to only apply the requirements of IEC/IEEE 80005-1 to vessels required by law to have HVSCs. If this section is intended to be applicable to HVSCs NOT required by law, then the language should be updated to be more clear.  We recommend removing the language that limits the requirements to shore connections required by law.

Comment: SOLAS II-2/9.4.1.1.5 includes a number of paragraphs which include requirements for safe functioning of the fire door release system. We suggest that the section referenced be expanded to include additional paragraphs in 9.4.1.1.5.  The paragraph referenced does not seem useful without the additional context of nearby paragraphs.

Rule Change: 81

Comment: As written, the requirement referencing exclusively NEC 501.5 OR NEC 505.9(C) does not make sense. NEC 501.5 directly references NEC 505.9(C), and the sections must be used together. Related to comment on change #82.  

Rule Change: 82

Comment: §111.105-3(c) appears to be intended to functionally replace the removed §111.105-5, but it does not retain the reference to IEC 60079 series. We recommend retaining the reference to the IEC 60079 series.

Rule Change: 105(a)
CFR Reference: §112.05-5
Comment: We note the update to require unity service factor on all emergency loads.  We recommend making the requirement consistent with class society and SOLAS requirements that allow for ""due regard being paid to such services as may have to be operated simultaneously.""  This will have beneficial impact on US-flagged vessel design by allowing emergency generators that are more closely matched to the loads that would be needed in an emergency.  As proposed, the rule requires significantly oversizing emergency generators since the design must account for all connected loads, whether they would be operated together or not.  Oversizing of this machinery has consequences that spiral throughout the vessel design given the location of the emergency generator and its fuel source high in the vessel.

Rule Change: 105(b)

Comment: The reference to ABS MVR 4-8-2/5.19 Table 2 would be more comprehensive if the requirements of ABS MVR 4-8-2/5.19.2 were also included. Specifically, the provisions of 5.19.2(c) should be included to improve protection of the emergency diesel generator when used in port.  We recommend, at a minimum, that the rule change consider clarifying the alarms/shutdowns required versus the shutdowns allowed or disallowed.

Rule Change: 106
CFR Reference: §112.05-7(e)
Comment: This paragraph appears to be describing requirements for breaker coordination to main services while using the emergency generator in port. The intended requirements are unclear. 
We are concerned that the requirements could be interpreted to require full breaker coordination, which is not feasible on many vessels with large distribution breakers fed from the main switchboard which are not designed to coordinate with a small power source such as the in-port generator. This is similar to vessels when on shore power, the capacity of these in port sources is limited, making full coordination infeasible.  
We believe the intent of the rule is to ensure the availability of the emergency power system if it is being used as the power source while in-port.  We recommend editing the language to remove reference to the main power system and focus the rule on the emergency power system.",,,,,,,

First, is the need to modify the definition ""MOU"" found on page 21440 of this action's Federal Register Notice in Section II - ""Abbreviations"". This definition should read ""Mobile Offshore Unit"" instead of ""Marine Offshore Unit"". IMO, as an example, recognizes ""Mobile Offshore Unit"" in A 1079 (28); RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE TRAINING AND CERTIFICATION OF PERSONNEL ON MOBILE OFFSHORE UNITS (MOUs). Also, see https://iadclexicon.org/mobile-offshore-unit-mou/ for other recognized sources for this definition. Secondly, Table 3 on page 21462 of the notice denotes 46 U.S. Flagged MODUs having to comply with Subchapter J requirements. Despite what may be currently listed in MISLE, IADC's latest tally of U.S. flagged MODUs is certainly less than 5, and likely only to comprise the Helix Q4000, Enterprise Offshore Drilling's EOD 201, and possibly the Spartan Rigs 202 and 303. Modifying Table 3 to read ""< 5"" will much more accurately reflect the scope of Subchapter J's application to U.S. flagged MODUs. Feel free to contact IADC/me for further clarification as may be necessary.",,,,,,,

I am commenting in the hopes of avoiding a future disaster like the one that claimed their lives.

1: For which types of passenger vessels should the Coast Guard require an SMS? No vessel is immune to danger, and no number of passengers is too small to be worth keeping safe. A Safety Management System (SMS) should be required for as wide a range of passenger vessels as possible to assure greatest potential to save lives. One criteria could be vessels that travel more than a half-hours distance from emergency help in the case of a disaster.

3: To what extent would an SMS encourage sharing or prevent the isolation (“silo-ing”) of information? A SMS should absolutely be shared with all vessels in a fleet and there must be explicit requirements for doing so, including evidence that it has been done.

7: If a comprehensive SMS is required, are there more prescriptive USCG regulations currently in the CFR that could be removed because the SMS would serve a similar function in promoting safety? No. In addition to SMS, additional regulations are also necessary to incorporate the requirements contained in the Regulations for Covered Small Passenger Vessels passed in the National Defense Authorization Act of 2021. These regulations ensure compliance with overnight roving patrols. The failure to provide the overnight roving patrol was determined to be the probable cause of the Conception tragedy. In addition the Act provides for additional regulations for the safe handling, storage, and operation of lithium ion batteries, improved fire and safety training protocols, increased fire detection and suppression systems, interconnected fire detection equipment including audible and visual alarms, two independent routes of escape and a protocol and monitoring devices to ensure a roving patrol is awake and on active duty. 

8. If a comprehensive SMS is not necessary or justified, what aspects of an SMS would be appropriate to include in this regulatory framework? A SMS is justified, period. A maintenance plan or emergency plan doesn’t take the place of full SMS. 

15. Should the Coast Guard require a certification process, an audit process or both? Yes. I firmly believe in certifications and audits; meaning review, approval, and oversight by the Coast Guard. If you don’t have such a program, including auditing, then how do we know if operators are meeting the standards?

16. Should the Coast Guard-required SMS be subject solely to independent third-party audits? Yes. Industry-run audits run the risk of overlooking deficiencies and pose internal conflicts of interest. A third party audit by a body with no financial or other conflict of interest should be required. It should be done at least annually and without prior notice.

17. What training or knowledge requirements are appropriate for crewmembers on passenger vessels with an SMS? Crewmembers need to be tested frequently (quarterly) through drills to assure that they are trained and fully knowledgeable to respond to potential hazards and accidents. 

19. How would the costs and benefits of expanding other existing regulations differ from the costs and benefits of requiring SMSs for all passenger vessels? The SMS should be required, period. The SMS should have been required a decade ago and the consequences of the failure to implement and enforce can be measured by the loss of lives.

22. Are there any additional factors that we should consider? The sinking of the Conception shows that safety regulations cannot be thought of only in the hypothetical. Even now, over a year later, I am regularly caught off-guard by my grief: I'll learn a piece of marine science trivia and wonder what interesting thing Kendra would have had to say about it, only to be knocked breathless by the realization that I'll never get to find out, or I'll read a news item about a teacher going above and beyond to inspire a love of learning in their students and think about how many more high schoolers would have discovered a love of physics had Scott's time on Earth not been cut short. Their losses were devastating and utterly preventable with better safety standards.",,,,,,,

Are there any additional factors that we should consider? Over 30 people perished in the Conception fire, including a cousin and uncle of mine.

1: For which types of passenger vessels should the Coast Guard require an SMS? A Safety Management System (SMS) should be required for as wide a range of passenger vessels as possible to assure greatest potential to save lives. One criteria could be vessels that travel more than a half-hours distance from emergency help in the case of a disaster.

3: To what extent would an SMS encourage sharing and prevent the ""siloing"" of information in which information about safety risks or best practices was known to one vessel not not sure with others? A SMS should absolutely be shared with all vessels in a fleet and there must be explicit requirements for doing so, including evidence that it has been done.

Are there any additional factors that we should consider? My uncle R. Scott Chan (59 years old) and cousin Kendra Chan (26 years old) were killed in the September 2019 fire aboard the MV Conception. Their deaths, along with the deaths of 32 other divers, could have been prevented with the adoption and implementation of an SMS. The USCG must enact the strictest possible SMS rules to ensure no other family has to endure the loss and pain and grief that our family has.
* 1: For which types of passenger vessels should the Coast Guard require an SMS? A Safety Management System (SMS) should be required for as many passenger vessels as possible to protect the greatest number of lives.
* 3: To what extent would an SMS encourage sharing and prevent the ""siloing"" of information in which information about safety risks or best practices was known to one vessel but not shared with others? An SMS would standardize safety-related policies and procedures to ensure all vessels in a fleet are in coordination with each other.

Certifications and audits (i.e. review, approval, and oversight by the Coast Guard) should absolutely be a requirement. Industry self-regulation is inadequate and will undoubtedly result in preventable accidents.

Industry-run audits run the risk of overlooking deficiencies and pose internal conflicts of interest. A third party audit by a body with no financial or other conflict of interest should be required. It should be done at least annually and without prior notice.
* 17. What training or knowledge requirements are appropriate for crewmembers on passenger vessels with an SMS? Crewmembers should be required to conduct safety drills at least quarterly to ensure they are trained and fully knowledgeable to respond to potential hazards and accidents. 
* 19. How would the costs and benefits of expanding other existing regulations differ from the costs and benefits of requiring SMSs for all passenger vessels? The most crucial benefit of an SMS is that critical policies will be implemented to prevent the loss of human lives.",,,,,,,

Are there any additional factors that we should consider?  YES.  Two good friends of mine, Scott and Kendra Chan, lost their lives on Conception.  Scott was a coworker of mine in Silicon Valley for many years.  He and I took multiple dive trips together on the Conception during the mid 1980s.  While I lost interest in the sport as family obligations grew, Scott continued to dive regularly, and in time his daughter Kendra came to share his love of our coastal waters and the sea life that abounds therein.   Scott retired from engineering, and launched a 2nd career as a high school physics teacher, where he influenced the lives of our next generation of leaders.  Kendra channeled her love for the ocean into a career as a marine biologist.   These are but 2 of the many precious souls in that terrible and unnecessary tragedy on the Conception.  We must take steps to ensure that such events do not happen again.

Kendra Chan (26 years old) and Scott Chan (59 years old) were killed among 32 others on the MV conception in September 2019.  Kendra was an accomplished young woman with a full life ahead of her.  Kendra was one of my daughter's friends in high school, she was admired by all for her kindness and intelligence.  She had a promising career in environmental protection.  Her loss is immeasurable along with the loss of her father, Scott.  Scott Chan was a dedicated teacher, engineer and active member of the community he lived in.  He was known by the Los Altos community for encouraging elementary school kids to bike and walk to school and delighted them with his love for cars.  He was also a loving father and partner.  Their preventable deaths have caused incalculable pain to their immediate family and to us, their friends and community. Regulations must be enacted to prevent more tragedy.  
1: For which types of passenger vessels should the Coast Guard require an SMS? A Safety Management System (SMS) should be required for as wide a range of passenger vessels as possible to assure greatest potential to save lives. One criteria could be vessels that travel more than a half-hours distance from emergency help in the case of a disaster.
3: To what extent would an SMS encourage sharing and prevent the ""siloing"" of information in which information about safety risks or best practices was known to one vessel not not sure with others? A SMS should absolutely be shared with all vessels in a fleet and there must be explicit requirements for doing so, including evidence that it has been done.
7: If a comprehensive SMS is required, are there more prescriptive USCG regulations currently in the CFR that could be removed because the SMS would serve a similar function in promoting safety? No.  In addition to SMS, additional regulations are also necessary to incorporate the requirements contained in the Regulations for Covered Small Passenger Vessels passed in the National Defense Authorization Act of 2021. These regulations ensure compliance with overnight roving patrols. The failure to provide the overnight roving patrol was determined to be the probable cause of the Conception tragedy. In addition the Act provides for additional regulations for the safe handling, storage, and operation of lithium ion batteries, improved fire and safety training protocols, increased fire detection and suppression systems, interconnected fire detection equipment including audible and visual alarms, two independent routes of escape and a protocol and monitoring devices to ensure a roving patrol is awake and on active duty. 
8. If a comprehensive SMS is not necessary or justified, what aspects of an SMS would be appropriate to include in this regulatory framework? A SMS is justified, period. A maintenance plan or emergency plan doesn’t take the place of full SMS. 
15. Should the Coast Guard require a certification process, an audit process or both? Yes. I firmly believe in certifications and audits; meaning review, approval, and oversight by the Coast Guard. If you don’t have such a program, including auditing, then how do we know if operators are meeting the standards?
16. Should the Coast Guard-required SMS be subject solely to independent third-party audits? Yes. An industry-run audits run the risk of overlooking deficiencies and pose internal conflicts of interest. A third party audit by a body with no financial or other conflict of interest should be required. It should be done at least annually and without prior notice.
17. What training or knowledge requirements are appropriate for crewmembers on passenger vessels with an SMS? Crewmembers need to be tested frequently (quarterly) through drills to assure that they are trained and fully knowledgeable to respond to potential hazards and accidents. 
19. How would the costs and benefits of expanding other existing regulations differ from the costs and benefits of requiring SMSs for all passenger vessels? The SMS should be required, period.  The SMS should have been required a decade ago and the consequences of the failure to implement and enforce can be measured by the loss of lives.",,,,,,,

Kendra worked in the field of marine ecology and conservation and was having such an impact, at the young age of barely 26, that the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service honored her with a recognition usually given to older, senior scientists in the Service. If the captain, crew, and boat owners had complied with regulations to have an awake and roaming night watch, if there had been fire alarms on all decks, and if there had been escape hatches that people could actually get through in seconds, those loved ones could have been saved.

USCG-2020-0123] RIN 1625-AC65 Safety Management Systems for Domestic Passenger Vessels AGENCY: Coast Guard

ASSP is the oldest society of safety professionals in the world. Founded in 1911, we represent more than 38,000 professionals advancing workplace safety and health in every industry, in every state and around the globe. ASSP members have set the occupational safety and health (OSH) community’s standards for excellence, ethics and practice for more than 100 years.

It is important to note that the Society does not have a position on the proposed rule.  This submission is only intended to offer technical materials that might be of assistance during future review of safety management systems by the Coast Guard.  We are aware that the ASSP materials are related to occupational safety and health but might be of some interest based on the proposal detailed in the Federal Register.  

The following materials and files are attached and we hope they are of value:

	ASSP has a position statement on the use of management systems and the return-on-investment for the implementation of such programs.  We do understand this statement addresses occupational safety and health in business and industry but might still be of value when evaluating this issue.

	We are not sure if the Coast Guard is aware, but the U.S. Department of Labor is finalizing an extensive study on the use of safety management systems.  We are aware that the results of this study may not necessarily apply to this proposal.  However, the Coast Guard may get some value from the study after its release. Agency Information Collection Activities; Submission for OMB Review; Comment Request, Employer Adoption of Voluntary Health and Safety Standards, New Collection

	ASSP offers a series of American National Standards addressing occupational heath and safety management systems.  We will included a document including information on our standards written under accreditation by the American National Standards Institute [ANSI].  We do offer the following publication on a complimentary basis that the Coast Guard and its stakeholders may wish to review when considering this proposal:

ASSP GM - Z10.101-2019 Guidance Manual: Keep Your People Safe in Smaller Organizations:  The ASSP/Z10 Guidance Manual is a quick start guide for implementing Z10 in a small to medium size organization. This document outlines the basics of health and safety management systems, contains in-depth discussions of new and innovative approaches and provides the tools and information to help you succeed. Useful forms and checklists are included to assist with accessing your current program and guiding you toward improvements. Detailed examples of how the standard can be implemented are also included.

Thank you for your attention to this matter and please let us know if we can provide any additional information on safety management systems.

22. Please take these comments seriously. Kendra Chan was my best friend. She was a brilliant scientist, a passionate educator, a passionate nature and ocean lover, and beloved friend by colleagues and friends alike. She was intertwined in my life and I am still reeling from her death because she was taken far too soon and she had big dreams of how she was going to continue changing the world. 

Kendra Chan and Scott Chan were diligent about their safety and were always prepared for any situation. They regularly brought extra gear in order to help others who were not prepared or had malfunctioning gear. They trusted the diving boat company to keep them safe. An entire boat of brilliant, safety-oriented, passionate divers lost their lives in this preventable accident. You should do everything in your power to make sure this never happens again. ",,,,,,,

22. Are there any additional factors that we should consider? The loss of my brother, Raymond Scott Chan, and my niece, Kendra Moore Chan, among the 34 souls who perished in the horrific fire on the Conception on September 2, 2019 is excruciatingly painful. These were two bright lights who lived fully, always conscious of how their actions could benefit society and the global environment. In one preventable incident, their lives were extinguished. The fire and sinking of the dive boat was totally needless and completely avoidable had safety been at the forefront of the operation.

This includes regular review, approval, and oversight by the Coast Guard. In the absence of certification and auditing, there would be no way to know if operators are meeting the standards.

16. Should the Coast Guard-required SMS be subject solely to independent third-party audits? Yes, of course, a third-party should certify and audit. This process must not be relegated to a party within the industry, which may for their own business interests ignore deficiencies; it may pose internal conflicts of interest. A third party audit by a body with no financial or other conflict of interest must be required. It should be done at least annually and without prior notice.

17. What training or knowledge requirements are appropriate for crewmembers on passenger vessels with an SMS? Crewmembers need to be drilled and tested quarterly to assure that they are knowledgeable and trained to prevent accidents and to respond fully to potential hazards. 

19. How would the costs and benefits of expanding other existing regulations differ from the costs and benefits of requiring SMSs for all passenger vessels? How much is the life of each human being worth? The SMS should be required, without fail. If an SMS had been implemented and enforced ages ago, we would not have suffered the gruesome deaths aboard the Conception boat.

The Coast Guard should require SMS for vessels traveling more than thirty minutes from the nearest emergency help, carrying 10 or more passengers, and mandatory for vessels offering overnight accommodations. As highlighted in the MV Conception, the speed at which the fire engulfed the vessel meant that the USCG could not respond quickly enough to have a meaningful impact on the loss of life. An SMS well implemented would provide a buffer in the time before the USCG can respond.

Question 15. Regulations without enforcement are merely suggestions. Audits and certifications are already commonplace in our society. For example, we require restaurants to undergo routine inspections by government officials for food safety and display their scores publicly, which ensures compliance and builds public trust. LA County publishes these scores routinely on their website (https://ehservices.publichealth.lacounty.gov/ezsearch), in addition to postings at the establishment. Why should this kind of system not be implemented for passenger vessels as well? Would anyone willingly choose to eat at a restaurant that has a food safety score of ""F,"" let alone trust their lives on an overnight passenger vessel with the same rating? 

Question 16. Safety should be transparent. Public audits and certifications encourage a culture of safety and trust. Any Audits/Certifications need to be done by the USCG or an independent organization that does not have ties to industry to reduce conflicts of interest.

Question 17. Crew members need to be well-trained on SMS procedures as part of their job requirements, and be periodically evaluated for knowledge and compliance to the procedures, at least once a year if not more frequently.

Question 22. On Labor Day 2019, I lost my father Raymond ""Scott"" Chan and sister Kendra Chan, in the MV Conception fire. Losing half my family due to a lack of safety protocols has been profoundly distressing over the last year and a half since they've been gone. My father and sister were very safety-oriented on their travels, and before their deaths were confirmed in the accident, I believed that if anyone would make it out alive, it would be them. Despite their level of training or preparedness, the lack of compliance to safety regulations was a significant factor in their deaths.",,,,,,,

Are there any additional factors that we should consider? Scott Chan had dedicated his life to the next generation by becoming a high school physics teacher after a highly successful career as an engineer. Scott was highly regarded by his students and peers. He also shared his expertise frequently with other teachers, helping their students as well. The pain felt by Scott's students because of this preventable and heart-breaking loss is unfathomable. Studies show that a teacher as effective at teaching physics as Scott adds hundreds of thousands of dollars to the lifetime income of their students. This tragedy was a large economic loss, the costs associated with preventing another by these rules are negligible. Kendra Chan was at the start of a career that would have resulted in large positive impacts to the environmental health of our planet. Her loss hurts everyone on Earth.

A SMS should absolutely be shared with all vessels in a fleet and there must be explicit requirements for doing so, including evidence that it has been done.

7: If a comprehensive SMS is required, are there more prescriptive USCG regulations currently in the CFR that could be removed because the SMS would serve a similar function in promoting safety? No. In addition to SMS, additional regulations are also necessary to incorporate the requirements contained in the Regulations for Covered Small Passenger Vessels passed in the National Defense Authorization Act of 2021. These regulations ensure compliance with overnight roving patrols. The failure to provide the overnight roving patrol was determined to be the probable cause of the Conception tragedy. In addition the Act provides for additional regulations for the safe handling, storage, and operation of lithium ion batteries, improved fire and safety training protocols, increased fire detection and suppression systems, interconnected fire detection equipment including audible and visual alarms, two independent routes of escape and a protocol and monitoring devices to ensure a roving patrol is awake and on active duty.

8. If a comprehensive SMS is not necessary or justified, what aspects of an SMS would be appropriate to include in this regulatory framework? A SMS is justified, period. A maintenance plan or emergency plan doesn’t take the place of full SMS. Now is the time for the Coast Guard to stop ignoring the recommendations of the NTSB and make passenger and crew safety their top priority.

15. Should the Coast Guard require a certification process, an audit process or both? Yes. I firmly believe in certifications and audits; meaning review, approval, and oversight by the Coast Guard. If you don’t have such a program, including auditing, then how do we know if operators are meeting the standards?

16. Should the Coast Guard-required SMS be subject solely to independent third-party audits? Yes. An industry-run audits run the risk of overlooking deficiencies and pose internal conflicts of interest. A third party audit by a body with no financial or other conflict of interest should be required. It should be done at least annually and without prior notice.

17. What training or knowledge requirements are appropriate for crewmembers on passenger vessels with an SMS? Crewmembers need to be tested frequently (quarterly) through drills to assure that they are trained and fully knowledgeable to respond to potential hazards and accidents. Crewmembers also need to be confident that they can share information about violations without fear of retribution.

19. How would the costs and benefits of expanding other existing regulations differ from the costs and benefits of requiring SMSs for all passenger vessels? The SMS should be required, period. The SMS should have been required a decade ago and the consequences of the failure to implement and enforce can be measured by the loss of lives.",,,,,,,

I agree with implementing SMS requirements for passenger vessels. Too few operators are now using a SMS that would ensure safe operations. Most companies all feel they provide a safe vessel but the latest loss of life shows there are areas for improvement.

Docket No. USCG-2020-0123

1. Factors requiring an SMS should be those that most directly relate to the passengers on board, i.e. the human factor, not factors such as fire-retardant materials or life raft capacity, which can become moot in unforeseen circumstances. An SMS should be required on as wide a range of passenger vessels as possible, including: any vessel providing overnight accommodations, any vessel carrying 12 or more passengers, and any vessel traveling more than a half hour from emergency help.

3. An SMS should not only encourage sharing of information among vessels in a fleet, it should require it. In the case of the MV Conception disaster, if information had been shared about the battery fire on the Conception’s sister ship, the Vision, the tragic fire and loss of 34 lives on the Conception could well have been prevented.

4. An SMS should be implemented across a fleet by adopting best practices used by similar businesses to share information, conduct training, and develop a company culture of safety and accountability. There should be clear communication and requirements for compliance.

7. Requiring an SMS should not provide cover for removing existing regulations. In fact, several new regulations are required in the Regulations for Covered Small Passenger Vessels in the National Defense Authorization Act of 2021. Among other things, these address roving night patrols; storing and using lithium ion batteries; fire detection equipment; and routes of escape.

8. New regulations are not substitutes for a robust SMS. Both are needed.

10. Guidance and practical examples of how to implement a system could be incredibly valuable, and save time and money. Such guidance can also help build compliance and a positive culture around implementing safety systems.

15. Yes, the Coast Guard should provide certifications and audits of all vessels to ensure that they are in compliance. Without certifications and audits, neither employees nor passengers have any assurance that operators are complying with safety regulations. Ensuring compliance is essential.

16. Independent third-party audits should be used to ensure objectivity, and they should be done annually. 

17. Crew members should be trained and tested on safety protocols, and they should receive refreshers and re-testing quarterly.

19. Requiring an SMS has been delayed too long, at the cost of many lives. 

20. The benefit and cost of a fully independent audit (not conducted by an industry association) could be measured in dollars. It can also be measured in lives saved versus a death toll. The cost of an annual safety audit should be part of the normal cost of doing business—well worth the price compared to being responsible for the loss of a human life.

21. Since most people have a cognitive bias in favor of good outcomes (i.e. we think the worst will never happen to us), financial incentives could be a way for the Coast Guard to jump-start compliance with an SMS requirement. That said, any financial incentive should go hand-in-hand with penalties for not adopting an SMS. The ultimate goal should be to create an ongoing culture of safety that saves lives and benefits all stakeholders.

22. The loss of 34 people on the MV Conception on Sept. 2, 2019, shocked the world and filled newspapers and TV screens for a time. For those who lost relatives and friends, the loss is for a lifetime. I’ve seen the impact to a dear friend, who has endured the unimaginable loss her life partner of 35 years and their beautiful 26-year-old daughter. I’ve felt the grief of my own family over the loss of friends we’d shared our lives with for 18 years. The world is poorer for the loss of our friends’ passion, brilliance and dedication to public service. My hope is that the Coast Guard will act now--with equal passion, brilliance, and dedication—to implement and enforce a Safety Management System that will create and sustain a new level of accountability and safety, and save lives in the future.

I'd suggest a requirement to have modern OBAs in a variety of strategic places throughout the vessel, and require that the crew have annual certification on their use. I'd also suggest, based on what I read about the entire affair, that the emergency exits be clearly lit, and perhaps have LED strips in the deck that point to the exit. And, obviously, make the exit bigger and ensure that nothing is blocking egress. Finally, a couple of thoughts - have an alarm that a crew member can activate via a large ""Emergency"" switch on the bridge, and at other stations on the vessel, and set up a system whereby the watchstander has to reset some kind of alarm every prescribed interval to ensure that that no one will miss a fire like the one reported. We used old-fashioned ""Detex"" clocks when making fire watch rounds when I was in A school at Governor's Island.",,,,,,,

I was devastated to learn that my college friend, Scott Chan, age 59, and his daughter, Kendra Chan, in her mid-twenties, were among the 34 people killed in the deadly fire aboard the Conception diving boat on Labor Day 2019.  I am also friends with Scott's widow, Victoria Moore, and my heart aches for her and her remaining child at having lost half of their nuclear family that day.  It is even more tragic that this incident could have been prevented with stronger safety standards.  I hope that the lives lost will not be in vain, and that standards will be upgraded to prevent future tragedies.",,,,,,,

I wish to submit my comments regarding the Safety Management Systems (SMSs) to improve the safety for passengers in the operation of US-flagged vessels. Such measures would also reduce accidents and thereby also protect vessels and other property.

There have been investigations which have identified many improvements, which should be implemented soonest. Although the installation of systems and modification to existing systems will take time, some changes are of such importance that an immediate change is not soon enough. Requiring changes before any commercial operation is permitted is certainly not unreasonable. All commercial vessels should have effective alarm systems to independently detect fire/smoke/gas problems. This system should have a dual energy source; that is, batteries for back up. Furthermore, the alarm must notify the entire vessel, not simply the cabin that sound the alarm.

There also is the issue of enforcement of standards. Generally, there may be warnings, fines, etc. for violations.  This may be reasonable for a vessel for personal use, but commercial vessels should have a more stringent level of action.  For a commercial vessel that has a violation, I suggest that the vessel be prohibited from operating until the violation is corrected and that the captain’s license be forfeited.  This may sound extreme, but it is not unreasonable. The captain is responsible for implementing the safety standards and ensuring that they are functioning properly.  The Coast Guard is responsible for checking/testing/confirming that the safety systems are functioning.

Finally, there is the issue of enforcement. I lived on Lake Erie for the first 21 years of my life and for a few years I had a small boat – 16 foot Lyman. The Coast Guard would occasionally stop me to check life preservers, lights, flares, etc. For commercial vessels I think a periodic examination – every month or two, would not be unreasonable.

Thank you for your attention.

The opening sentence states “The Coast Guard is evaluating the potential use of Safety Management Systems (SMSs) to improve safety and reduce marine casualties on board U.S.-flagged passenger vessels”.  If there is room for improvement and there is a realization of the need in the reduction of marine casualties? What is there debate? 
I have very close friend who has to deal with the agonizing loss of a child due to the lack of basic safety protocol being followed on a domestic passenger vessel. This is totally a needless and inconceivable sorrow that the families of not only passengers but the crew that were lost have to carry with them. The Safety Management System must be developed, implemented, and people found not following the guidelines must be held accountable before we have more unnecessary tragedies.

1: For which types of passenger vessels should the Coast Guard require an SMS? A Safety Management System (SMS) should be required for as wide a range of passenger vessels as possible to assure greatest potential to save lives. One criteria could be vessels that travel more than a half-hours distance from emergency help in the case of a disaster.

3: To what extent would an SMS encourage sharing and prevent the ""siloing"" of information in which information about safety risks or best practices was known to one vessel not not sure with others?

21.What incentives could the Coast Guard provide passenger vessel companies to adopt an SMS? And what is the most appropriate means or method for the Coast Guard to incentivize these companies to adopt an SMS?  The incentives that the Coast Guard could provide to passenger vessel companies to adopt a SMS would be to assure the companies that they will not likely have crew or company members go to prison for gross negligence and involuntary manslaughter and be sued in civil court for wrongful death.  Companies don't need any other incentives.  We're talking about saving lives.   Why should there be other incentives, such as financial incentives, when the paramount issue to protect lives?

22. Are there any additional factors that we should consider?  I lost my cousins Scott and Kendra Chan is the Concepcion fire, a tragedy that could have been prevented. Not only is this a painful personal and family loss, but a loss for the many public high school students who love and valued Scott as a friend, mentor, and physics and mathematics teacher, and for the colleagues and wildlife Kendra worked with and nurtured at the Dept of Fish & Wildlife. Both my cousins were stewards of the land and sea and supported sustainable gardens, public lands and waterways and seas on both the local and national level. I miss them as stewards of our shared Chinese American legacy and history as well. We need to prevent these kinds of tragedies, for every life lost is a valued community lost.

22.  Losing Kendra and Scott Chan *my friend's husband and daughter has been such profound loss for all. They had so much life ahead of them and now won't be here to have those experiences. Losing loved ones is never easy, but when such loss as this boat tragedy for SO MANY families- and how it could have been avoided is what we all must live with.  Moving forward to try to improve safety is NECESSARY so such tragedies don't repeat themselves.  Scott was a husband, father, son, sibling, and friend who has left so many behind. Kendra was a young woman finding her path with ecological/nature and just in the prime of her young life.  Leaving her mom and brother behind will be an unbearable void that they both will have to find strength to live through. Please let's work to make our waters SAFE!",,,,,,,

I make this appeal as one of those affected after the tragic death by fire of over 30 individuals on a paid dive boat which  had inadequate fire suppression systems and inadequate crew training. The cost of human life made more appalling because this COULD HAVE BEEN PREVENTED. The rules were in place and not enforced even tho the USCG had made known to the boat owner by citation. 
I say I am an affected person but certainly not by family relationship or even personal relationship to a victim. Those numbers total more than 250 per victim even by conservative measures: mother, father, grandparents, significant other, child, sister, brother. No. I am only connected as friend several years after the tragedy to a sister of a victim. And this connection grows wider every day, like a pebble in a pond.

A Safety Management System (SMS) should be required for as many passenger vessels as possible to protect the greatest number of lives.
3: To what extent would an SMS encourage sharing and prevent the ""silo-ing"" of information in which information about safety risks or best practices was known to one vessel but not shared with others? In this respect, I think an SMS greatly help broader sharing of best practices. It would standardize safety-related policies and procedures to ensure all vessels in a fleet are in coordination with each other.
7: If a comprehensive SMS is required, are there more prescriptive USCG regulations currently in the CFR that could be removed because the SMS would serve a similar function in promoting safety? No. In addition to SMS, additional regulations are also necessary to incorporate the requirements contained in the Regulations for Covered Small Passenger Vessels passed in the National Defense Authorization Act of 2021. These regulations ensure compliance with overnight roving patrols. The failure to provide the overnight roving patrol was determined to be the probable cause of the Conception tragedy. In addition the Act provides for additional regulations for the safe handling, storage, and operation of lithium ion batteries, improved fire and safety training protocols, increased fire detection and suppression systems, interconnected fire detection equipment including audible and visual alarms, two independent routes of escape and a protocol and monitoring devices to ensure a roving patrol is awake and on active duty.

There is staggering evidence that structured and documented procedures — like SMSs — save lives. Surgeon, writer, and public health leader Atul Gawande documents this phenomenon in “The Checklist Manifesto.” As Malcom Gladwell writes in a review of the book:

“[T]he routine tasks of surgeons [and many other professionals] have now become so incredibly complicated that mistakes of one kind or another are virtually inevitable: it’s just too easy for an otherwise competent doctor to miss a step, or forget to ask a key question or, in the stress and pressure of the moment, to fail to plan properly for every eventuality.” Gawande “visits with pilots and the people who build skyscrapers and comes back with a solution. Experts need checklists–literally–written guides that walk them through the key steps in any complex procedure.”

For more about “The Checklist Manifesto,” including Gladwell’s full review, visit: http://atulgawande.com/book/the-checklist-manifesto/. 

I urge the Coast Guard to act on this evidence and make SMSs mandatory for passenger vessels. By proactively capturing the maritime community’s expertise in written protocols, the Cost Guard can help ensure vessels are able to act in accordance with best practices  — even in crisis situations, when stress renders anyone, no matter how competent, more likely to err.

Also, there has to be wider stairwells and exits to expedite safe exit of all passengers and the addition of one more escape route could prove to be critical for saving lives. Finally, the charging station capacity should be increased to avoid overload and therefore fire hazard.Either that or there's got to be strict monitoring over the number of devices which are plugged in to to such station.

Are there any additional factors that we should consider? The loss of Kendra and Scott has shaken the entire community and will never stop being a shock. It is ridiculous that this tragedy occurred and could have been avoided.

1: For which types of passenger vessels should the Coast Guard require an SMS? A Safety Management System (SMS) should be required for as wide a range of passenger vessels as possible to assure greatest potential to save lives. One criteria could be vessels that travel more than a half-hours distance from emergency help in the case of a disaster.

3: To what extent would an SMS encourage sharing and prevent the ""siloing"" of information in which information about safety risks or best practices was known to one vessel not not sure with others? A SMS should absolutely be shared with all vessels in a fleet and there must be explicit requirements for doing so, including evidence that it has been done.

7: If a comprehensive SMS is required, are there more prescriptive USCG regulations currently in the CFR that could be removed because the SMS would serve a similar function in promoting safety? No.  In addition to SMS, additional regulations are also necessary to incorporate the requirements contained in the Regulations for Covered Small Passenger Vessels passed in the National Defense Authorization Act of 2021.

8. If a comprehensive SMS is not necessary or justified, what aspects of an SMS would be appropriate to include in this regulatory framework? A SMS is justified, period. A maintenance plan or emergency plan doesn’t take the place of full SMS. 

15. Should the Coast Guard require a certification process, an audit process or both? Yes. I firmly believe in certifications and audits; meaning review, approval, and oversight by the Coast Guard. If you don’t have such a program, including auditing, then how do we know if operators are meeting the standards?

16. Should the Coast Guard-required SMS be subject solely to independent third-party audits? Yes. An industry-run audits run the risk of overlooking deficiencies and pose internal conflicts of interest. A third party audit by a body with no financial or other conflict of interest should be required. It should be done at least annually and without prior notice.

17. What training or knowledge requirements are appropriate for crewmembers on passenger vessels with an SMS? Crewmembers need to be tested frequently (quarterly) through drills to assure that they are trained and fully knowledgeable to respond to potential hazards and accidents. 

19. How would the costs and benefits of expanding other existing regulations differ from the costs and benefits of requiring SMSs for all passenger vessels? The SMS should be required, period.  The SMS should have been required a decade ago and the consequences of the failure to implement and enforce can be measured by the loss of lives.",,,,,,,

Re:  Docket No. USCG–2020–0123
Safety Management Systems for Domestic Passenger Vessels
As published in Federal Register on January 15, 2021

Ladies and Gentlemen:

My name is Richard A. Davison and I  strongly urge you to accept the Passenger Vessel Associations (PVA) recommendations as the Coast Guard moves forward in evaluating the application of SMS to the domestic passenger vessel industry:

·	Accept PVA’s Flagship SMS as an alternative to any prescriptive requirements such as the complete adoption of 33 CFR Part 96.
·	Allow qualified companies to implement the Streamline Inspection Program (SIP) (46 CFR Part 8) in lieu of an SMS.
·	Retain Coast Guard as primary authority responsible for inspection and audit oversight of a SMS on domestic passenger vessels.
o	Allow Third Party audits as an option for compliance not a mandate.
·	Any regulatory framework should allow for a scalable SMS since the vast majority of the domestic passenger vessel fleet is considered small businesses and many have limited shoreside management.
·	Provide a reasonable time frame for companies to come into compliance.  Both SMS and SIP require significant up-front dedication of time and resources. A five-year COI cycle is not unreasonable.

Thank you for the opportunity to comment on this important topic.

Sincerely,

Richard A. Davison

Kendra Chan and Scott Chan were beautiful souls whose lives were lost in large part due to safety protocols not being followed. Please do justice to their memory by taking safety seriously and implementing the policy put forth below.

1: For which types of passenger vessels should the Coast Guard require an SMS? A Safety Management System (SMS) should be required for as many passenger vessels as possible to protect the greatest number of lives.
3: To what extent would an SMS encourage sharing and prevent the ""siloing"" of information in which information about safety risks or best practices was known to one vessel but not shared with others? An SMS would standardize safety-related policies and procedures to ensure all vessels in a fleet are in coordination with each other.
7: If a comprehensive SMS is required, are there more prescriptive USCG regulations currently in the CFR that could be removed because the SMS would serve a similar function in promoting safety? No. In addition to SMS, additional regulations are also necessary to incorporate the requirements contained in the Regulations for Covered Small Passenger Vessels passed in the National Defense Authorization Act of 2021. These regulations ensure compliance with overnight roving patrols. The failure to provide the overnight roving patrol was determined to be the probable cause of the Conception tragedy. In addition the Act provides for additional regulations for the safe handling, storage, and operation of lithium ion batteries, improved fire and safety training protocols, increased fire detection and suppression systems, interconnected fire detection equipment including audible and visual alarms, two independent routes of escape and a protocol and monitoring devices to ensure a roving patrol is awake and on active duty. 
8. If a comprehensive SMS is not necessary or justified, what aspects of an SMS would be appropriate to include in this regulatory framework? A comprehensive SMS is justified in all situations.
15. Should the Coast Guard require a certification process, an audit process or both? Both. Certifications and audits (i.e. review, approval, and oversight by the Coast Guard) should absolutely be a requirement. Industry self-regulation is inadequate and will undoubtedly result in preventable accidents.
16. Should the Coast Guard-required SMS be subject solely to independent third-party audits? Yes. Industry-run audits run the risk of overlooking deficiencies and pose internal conflicts of interest. A third party audit by a body with no financial or other conflict of interest should be required. It should be done at least annually and without prior notice.

Although I support the spirit behind the proposed rule making, I do not believe that a Safety Management System would have prevented the marine casualties and loss of life that has occured. In most cases human error or a direct violation of existing Coast Guard requirements is found as the root cause of these tragedies. I do not believe requiring all small passenger vessels to implement a safety management system is realistic nor would it be successful in my opinion. Many good players in the Industry already utilize systems or processes that do resemble a SMS. This is just good practice. the existing regulations, if followed provide all that is needed to maintain an extremely high level of safety. There are those operators who simply do not follow or understand the regulations. They will certainly fail again when trying to implement a poorly executed SMS. It may look good on paper but at the deckplate level it will always be a different story. There are also many small companies that employ so few crew members that the idea behind having access to the highest level of management is ridiculous as the mechanic, Captain and owner are the same person. using a blanket requirement will not work for such a diverse Industry. If a company decides to implement a safety management system on its own then it should be credited for doing so. Flagship and SIP are excellent examples of systems that work well with the existing regulations and decrease risk. the USCG should be the only one charged with auditing in the event passenger vessels do in fact end up being required to have a safety management system.",,,,,,,

Scott and Kendra Chan were my dear friends since Kendra was 6 months old. Kendra was my daughter's first friend, and one of the few childhood friends she remained close to into adulthood. My husband and I were close to Scott and his wife, Vicki. Our families vacationed together through the years. They were like extended family to us. This entirely preventable tragedy robbed not only the Chan extended family of the love and companionship of these two amazing people, but also the very large network of friends who loved them dearly and are still mourning their loss.

It is heartbreaking to know that a fire occurred on the Vision a year prior to the Conception fire. An effort should have been made to change operating procedures regarding lithium battery charging. Roving night watches and logs should have been mandated and overseen by the owner and captain. Was the Conception following SIP or Flagship protocols? If so, they aren't enough.

I contemplated joining the excursion as I had in the past.  This organization was recognized as one of the best in the industry. I can no longer be confident of diving liveaboards trips having this incident in the back of my mind. Taxpayers and Survivors expect the USCG to put our money forward in prevention, not disaster response.

Hearing the NTSB Report that one of the other boats that is a part of the truth aquatics fleet had a fire (that seemed similar and didn’t yield immediate protective upgrades on any of the fleet and crew practices) is disturbing.  Specifically, that was related to unsafe electrical, battery, and charging practices.  More importantly, it serves as an example of corporate siloing perpetuated by a lack of consequence and lack of involvement from the USCG.

Quote from https://www.npr.org/2020/10/20/925940535/safety-board-blames-california-diving-boats-owner-for-fire-that-killed-34 states the following
“A sister vessel of the Conception, the Vision, had earlier experienced a fire caused by cellphone chargers, The Washington Post reports – but that fire was detected early and quickly put out. “

Did the coast guard follow up with the fleet, crew, and owners with required documentation detailing exactly what happened? 
Were rules and steps defined by the local USGS immediately after that fire that would require Truth Aquatics to follow recommended guidelines in preparation for any future trips?  Were any of the crewmembers tested on proper USGS procedures to make sure they were ready to support future trips based on the finding of that incident?

If not, documentation, proper procedures, and verification of adequate passenger safety should be provided by the USCG to address any outstanding issues on this fleet of vessels or any commercial vessels that experience a fire before they can go out. Reporting of all fires, on all commercial vessels minimally, should be mandatory.  Consequences of not doing so should be completed in a specified time by the USCG.  Reporting and documenting any fire needs to be part of a required SMS.

This will also help the USCG learn what fire hazards are common and need attention for all future vessel safety efforts.

See 3.2 Probably cause from the NTSB summary identifying company failures as the cause of this preventable tragedy.  Prevention requires the business to use safe and ethical practices.  Since this is not occurring, companies and vessels must be better regulated.
""3.2 Probable Cause
""The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable cause of the accident on board the small passenger vessel Conception was the failure of Truth Aquatics, Inc., to provide effective oversight of its vessel and crewmember operations . . . . ""

Specific findings are numerous -- worth noting and correcting.  SMSs should be legally required on vessels like those of the Truth Aquatics Fleet and they should be more robust.  All of the aspects noted by the NTSB, and more such as safer management of electronics and charging practices, deserve attention in SMSs.

It sounds as if Truth Aquatics didn’t require that all passengers and crew board the vessel at a specified time so that safety overviews were presented prior to getting underway.

In addition, the latter half of Probable cause in NTSB Summary States
"".../including requirements to ensure that a roving patrol was maintained, which allowed a fire of unknown cause to grow, undetected, in the vicinity of the aft salon on the main deck. Contributing to the undetected growth of the fire was the lack of a United States Coast Guard regulatory requirement for smoke detection in all accommodation spaces. Contributing to the high loss of life were the inadequate emergency escape arrangements from the vessel’s bunkroom, as both exited into a compartment that was engulfed in fire, thereby preventing escape.""

Specifically concerning the on board smoke detector system
Pg 74 of NTSB Report Items 7-9 reflect this summary 
Conclusions: 
7: The fire in the salon on the main deck would have been well developed before the smoke activated the smoke detectors in the bunkroom. 
8. Although the arrangement of detectors aboard the Conception met regulatory requirements, the lack of smoke detectors in the salon delayed detection and allowed for the growth of the fire, precluded firefighting and evacuation efforts, and directly led to the high number of fatalities in the accident. 
9. Interconnected smoke detectors in all accommodation spaces on Subchapter T and Subchapter K vessels would increase the chance that fires will be detected early enough to allow for successful firefighting and the evacuation of passengers and crew. 
 
Availability of smoke detectors in the salon and the fact that the detectors on the vessel were not interconnected contributed to the lack of time to exit the vessel.

The point those specific findings all hinge upon is accountability of paid professionals to provide a safe boating experience.  Tragically, there is not yet enough regulation in place to prevent this from happening again.  Thank you for making rules to improve a tragic, ongoing state of affairs.

Regarding the horrific Conception Disaster on 9/2/19, those beforehand, and those we can prevent in the future.

I am wondering if an automatic fire suppression system like Ansul could be implemented on vessels of this type.  Ansul is the same type of fire suppression system found in galleys and kitchens of cruise, military, navy, and other ships.  Had this type of system been in place, there should be no reason fire would have overcome this vessel.  The kitchen is the most dangerous area with fire fuels, and water cannot be used once fire reaches this area.  On a boat this size, no matter where or how the fire started, stopping it there could make all the difference.  Ansul can be implemented in electrical and other high risk areas.

I know costs could be considerable but they are nothing compared to the horrific loss of life experienced.  I imagine the designated Night Roving Patrol suffers a living tragedy, along with hundreds of Survivors, all who would willingly pay this on their own to prevent these tragic deaths.  In fact many of them may have incurred this much in financial costs alone, each of them, as a result of this preventable tragedy.  This should no longer be about saving money but saving lives.

Improving SMS rules to incorporate automatic Ansul type fire suppression systems, and escapes that lead away from high fire risk areas, is requested.  These rules should apply to vessels like the Conception, no matter their age.

Thank you for your cooperation in this matter.
There is no price tag on saving a life.

    I would like a solution to the existing enforcement of regulations to somehow be connected to the boat owners liability insurance. And if you review the MV Conception and the 34 people that died. Having a 5 million dollar policy is such a joke. If you want the owners to be more responsible let’s start with some serious liability insurance. If you raise it to 250 million you’ll get the insurance companies involved with safety inspections. The USCG doesn’t have to do it all. But if the owner doesn’t want to follow the regulations then they should notify the insurance carrier. This is how airlines are handled. Right now with such low policy limits all you’re doing is making cash cows for the insurance industry.

Due to the experience of several friends, I strongly believe that a Safety Management System (SMS) should be required for as many passenger vessels as possible to protect the greatest number of lives.
3: To what extent would an SMS encourage sharing and prevent the ""siloing"" of information in which information about safety risks or best practices was known to one vessel but not shared with others? 
Safety systems would standardize safety-related policies and procedures to ensure all vessels in a fleet are in coordination with each other.
7: If a comprehensive SMS is required, are there more prescriptive USCG regulations currently in the CFR that could be removed because the SMS would serve a similar function in promoting safety? 
No. Safety on the water should be The Priority.  In addition to SMS, additional regulations are also necessary to incorporate the requirements contained in the Regulations for Covered Small Passenger Vessels passed in the National Defense Authorization Act of 2021. These regulations ensure compliance with overnight roving patrols. The failure to provide the overnight roving patrol was determined to be the probable cause of the Conception tragedy. In addition the Act provides for additional regulations for the safe handling, storage, and operation of lithium ion batteries, improved fire and safety training protocols, increased fire detection and suppression systems, interconnected fire detection equipment including audible and visual alarms, two independent routes of escape and a protocol and monitoring devices to ensure a roving patrol is awake and on active duty. 
8. If a comprehensive SMS is not necessary or justified, what aspects of an SMS would be appropriate to include in this regulatory framework? 
A comprehensive SMS is justified in all situations.
15. Should the Coast Guard require a certification process, an audit process or both? 
Both!   Certifications and audits (i.e. review, approval, and oversight by the Coast Guard) should absolutely be a requirement. Industry self-regulation is inadequate and will undoubtedly result in preventable accidents.
16. Should the Coast Guard-required SMS be subject solely to independent third-party audits? 
Yes. Industry-run audits run the risk of overlooking deficiencies and pose internal conflicts of interest. A third party audit by a body with no financial or other conflict of interest must be required. It should be done at least annually and without prior notice.
17. What training or knowledge requirements are appropriate for crewmembers on passenger vessels with an SMS? 
Crewmembers should be required to conduct safety drills at least quarterly to ensure they are trained and fully knowledgeable to respond to potential hazards and accidents. 
19. How would the costs and benefits of expanding other existing regulations differ from the costs and benefits of requiring SMSs for all passenger vessels? The most crucial benefit of an SMS is that critical policies will be implemented to prevent the loss of human lives.
22.  Are there any additional factors we should consider?  The tragedy on the Conception must never happen again.  It must be prevented at all costs - and an SMS would be an essential step toward assuring that another tragedy will    not    happen.",,,,,,,

Re: Docket No. USCG-2020-0123

Dear Admiral Schultz,

Our son, Charles McIlvain, was killed aboard the Conception dive boat along with 33 others when a fire broke out, went undetected and no suppression efforts made.  His preventable death at age 44 has changed our lives and that of our entire family forever.  Charlie was kind, generous, talented with a brilliant career, funny and most of all loved beyond measure.

It has been difficult to read some of the comments by vessel owner/operators.  I wonder if their responses would be the same if it was their family member who died in such horrific circumstances.  Comments such as “reacting to a few incidents seems overkill”.  In the case of the Conception 34 lives were lost, that is not an “incident” it is a disaster.  There have been other documented maritime disasters where the loss of life was great, again not an incident to those families who lost loved ones.  Another comment regarding the NTSB's multiple recommendations for an SMS as a “tired safety pitch” and “grandstanding”, working to prevent future senseless deaths is not “grandstanding”.

Much of my career was spent working for a Workers' Compensation Insurance Carrier.  A Safety Management System was implemented for every policy written to help provide effective and documented training and practices to reduce risk of injury or death.  All passenger vessels should have no less obligation to have this effective tool for safety oversight. If an SMS had been implemented the crew of the Conception would have been trained to respond to all emergencies which in this case was a fire, they were not.  A comprehensive SMS is not a financial or personnel burden on vessel operators of any size, it can be scalable to fit the vessel operations.  If implemented properly an SMS benefits the owner/operators by proactively identifying safety hazards, providing comprehensive training and putting safety protocols in place to reduce the possibility of injury or loss of life.  When a crew is properly trained in emergency procedures it protects not only them but the passengers on board.

Question 21 asks “What incentives could the Coast Guard provide passenger vessel companies to adopt an SMS?”  As a parent this question truly stings, the short answer is the incentive to save lives. Our son and the 32 other passengers who boarded the Conception put their lives in the hands of that crew, surely they would have had the right to expect that crew was properly trained to respond to any emergency, but they were not resulting in 34 deaths.  We mourn our son every waking minute, we cannot change the past but we can work to prevent another disaster like this from happening in the future and from any other family experiencing this unfathomable grief.  To that end we respectfully ask that the USCG implement the Safety Management Systems for Domestic Passenger Vessel Rule.

Any passenger vessels which provide overnight accommodations (or are designed to stay at sea for >24 hrs) should have an SMS. Relative risk of injury or death increase the longer a trip is. Passengers place their confidence in the crew and company to safeguard them on extended trips, particularly when passengers are asleep. The tragic deaths of the Conception and delayed emergency support were due in part to the remote location and time of the accident (early morning). I believe having an SMS in place might have precluded all or part of the MV Conception accidents.


8. Improved SMS’s are justifiable for all vessels. Comprehensive plans for safety should always be considered necessary, and they are justified by our shared values of human wellbeing, including preservation of life, and mitigation of risk. 

10. Upon the passage of new regulations, the Coast Guard should offer (at minimum) a virtual workshop series to the passenger vessel industry, including necessary SMS components, examples of successful and lacking SMS’s, crew training, and suggestions for physical implementation and maintenance. Expertise from the Coast Guard would save time and labor for companies newly required to develop SMS. 

16. Yes, third-party audits would decrease conflicts of interest and bias.

22. As a private citizen, I would prioritize giving business to companies that have a comprehensive, regulated SMS in place, even if costs to the consumer are increased.  My best friend perished on the Conception and I will not consider another dive trip in California until I see improved SMS’s in this industry, and I very much hope all vessels with similar builds, trip durations, and purposes will also be required to expand their safety plans. Vessel safety is a topic I am extremely concerned about as a recreational diver, whale watcher, and family member of avid fishermen. I think our coastal communities deserve greater peace of mind and confidence in our vessel industries’ safety standards. Most of all, we deserve preservation of life. 
Thank you for your time and efforts spent on this important topic.

My daughters and their dad died, I am sure, trying, unsuccessfully, to escape from the hellish fire on the M/V Conception on September 2, 2019 on the coast of Santa Barbara, California. 
I have been a Registered Nurse for over 35 years. I worked as a School Nurse for 31 years. In every place I have been employed there was plan in place for emergencies. Especially, in our school system with regular fire drills and lately with active shooters. There was a Crisis team at every school with every Crisis team member having a specific role and knowing exactly what was expected of them incase of any emergency. Every building that housed children during the day had to practice scenarios of active, shooters, fires, natural disasters and possible suicides. We called it Crisis Management.  I truly believe that every boat small or large especially those that carry passengers should implement a safety management system to save lives of crew and passenger. If an SMS had been in place and the crew followed protocol, my girls and their dad would still be alive today. I miss them every day, my life has lost the brightness of my girls and their dad. My life will, forever, have a never ending void. Their horrific death could have been prevented, would have been prevented if a SMS was in place and the crew was properly trained.  My life and that of my daughter has forever changed. There is no silver lining for me, only a never ending void. 

Information Requested:
1. In my opinion, every vessel that carries passengers should have a SMS. When non-boat people enter onto a boat or vessel we depend on the owner to keep us as safe as possible with every possibility of surviving should an accident happen aboard their vessel. 
2. A structure SMS system would be beneficial incase of an emergency in saving lives. in my opinion, this is common sense science. Having a SMS, practicing and knowing protocols are basic to safety. I wish I had studies to provide that those are that are prepared have a better chance of helping others survive.
3. I believe a SMS would encourage sharing of best practices within an organization and individual boat owners. 
4. A SMS should not that challenging to implement. Using common sense to running an organization or business and implementing safety standards should be the first priority.
5. no comment
6.A SMS system should be in place.

10. I believe by having standards and minimum expectations established by the CG would be advisable. Some fill in the blanks type of operating manual. 
11. no  comment
12. It should not ad too much cost to implement a SMS. I feel it should already be part of their mode of operation.  Employees  are already hire may be able to fill in the gaps. Advisors, may be the CG might be able to have have a facilitor to the operators in this area.

15. I believe their should be a certification process and an audit process.
16. The CG should also conduct audits. I am not sure who a third party would be.

22. Crew members need to be properly trained in the company's SMS. Passengers should be instructed on the location of safety equipment,  on how to release or use the life raft if there is one (there should be one). Emergency Exits from the lower bunk or sleeping area should have two exits that lead to two different locations. The exits, using the commom sense approach, should be in a location that is accessible and large enough for the biggest passenger very similar to the law of on  passenger aircrafts.

My comment comes as an employee of the Marine Chart Division in NOAA. We are responsible for updating nautical charts, including anchorage areas established by the Coast Guard. I am currently evaluating the proposed rulemaking on Anchorage Regulations; Mississippi River, Mile Markers 12 to 85 Above Head of Passes. Refer to Federal Register / Vol. 86, No. 165 / Monday August 30, 2021 / Pages 48354-48357, Docket Number USCG-2020-0154.

The proposed ruling discusses modifications to 9 anchorages and the creation of one new anchorage. Two of the modifications add notes for Cedar Grove Anchorage and Lower 12 Mile Point Anchorage. The notes discuss adjacent revetments and advise caution to the mariners in the anchorage.

Of the 10 anchorage areas discussed in this rule, I have identified 8 of them that run adjacent to revetment areas. In addition to Cedar Grove Anchorage and Lower 12 Mile Point Anchorage, there are adjacent revetments to Boothville Anchorage, Magnolia Anchorage, Belle Chasse Anchorage, Lower 9 Mile Anchorage, Point Michel Anchorage, and the new anchorage Phoenix Anchorage.

For consistency within the rule and increased awareness, my feedback is to add revetment notes similar to the Cedar Grove Anchorage and Lower 12 Mile Point anchorage notes, for all applicable anchorages.

The maritime industry is transit,  Fishers on all the coasts travel into different state and federal waters.  Making different requirements for safe traffic lanes is based on the anecdotal experience of the experience as in this case the Coast Guard Commander.  Many of the Coast Guard Commanders have a wealth of experience and opinions should be taken into consideration,  but it is the fishers whom work the same waters for generations that have the deal knowledge that is being sought.  It is with the knowledge of the coastal water off Long Island to Deleware out 100 miles, that I submit the request:
1) All “Transit Lanes” be consistent with “Vessel Traffic Lanes”
2) That there be No hard structure within one NM of any Traffic Lane.
3)  That all traffic lanes consist of a minimum 1nm separation lane.
4) That there be a traffic lane a minimum width of 1nm inbound.

5) That there be a minimum width of 1nm width out bound traffic lane.  

   It should be noted that the maritime industry looks for a MINIMUM of 1/2 mile between each vessel.  A 1nm wide traffic lane will allow inbound and out bound vessels to pass each other safely.  This is the standard in the Gulf of Mexico and should be the standard for the East Coast.  It should be noted that the economic feasibility of loosing so much ground to traffic lanes should not be a consideration.  BOEM selected the lease site sizes and the bidders knew what they were bidding on.  Any economic loss towards public safety is part of American Business standards.  Circumventing public safety for Industrial Energy Development Site profit margins is unacceptable.  ",,,,,,,

I am a 4th generation commercial fisherman.  My family has been involved in Commercial Fisheries for close to a century, working from North Carolina to New England.  I currently am the owner/captain of the F/V Lilly Rose out of Point Pleasant, NJ as well as a member and representative of the Fisherman's Dock Co-Operative.
We are asked to express our concerns over safe transit lanes yet have little mention of adverse effects on the commercial fishing industry, and industry that provides more than a billion dollars annually to just the state economy alone.  We are talking about creating transit lanes to popular fishing grounds, but what good is it if those grounds are no longer fishable because the ocean has become industrialized.
The proposed Hudson north area alone account's for roughly 60% of my annual income and is about to be wiped off the map.  The NY/NJ bight produces more fish and income than any other area on the entire eastern seaboard mostly due to the cold pool created in the area.  Massive congregations of scup, black sea bass, summer flounder, squid, and sea scallops amass annually in these areas, and every year they school in a different spot.
What can be done to assure that these areas remain fishable?  What type of spacing would be needed to tow in between these structures?  My best guess is that a 2-3 mile minimum spacing for a single boat to be able to tow, but that doesn't account for buried cables or other potential hazards to cause damage to fishing gear.
The more I attempt to be heard the more it seams I'm ignored by companies like orsted.   I continue to comment, and attend meetings but it does no good when im offered little to mostly no notice of meetings or public comment periods by these companies.  As a major stake holder in this area of the ocean, more should be done to work with the fisherman these companies so whole heartedly claim to be working along side.
Lastly, what happens to these structures in the long term?  It's true the the fishing fleet has been aging, but a younger generation, like myself, is starting to take over the wheel houses and how will our economic lives be affected?  Estimations say that the windmills should stand for 20 years, but most see major mechanical failures after 5-7.  Yeah salt water and moving parts don't mix, and being that these structures are way out in the ocean, maintenence is not an easy task.  So for the sake of argument, what happens after 20 years?  God willingly I'll still be fishing, but what about these structures?  Will they be abandoned like most have been already?  Will they be dismantled by the companies installing them?  Not likely considering most companies claim bankruptcy before completion of the product or shortly after, transfer they're assets, than take they're tax payer subsidized money, and run away!

I can go on for hours to express my abhorrence and skepticism of companies whose track record has only proved to guarantee greed and sell the tax payer a product with lies.  And in the end my profession is being threatened by snake oil salesman, and my worry is that the public is buying it under the guise of ""green energy.""  Please save America's last form of sustainable wild caught protein.",,,,,,,

In addition to the 17 federally permitted vessels that we operate, we work with many independent fishermen to develop and serve domestic and export markets for our combined catch.
 
I support Alternative 2 in the Draft PARS. The wind developers' proposed layouts do not accommodate safe transit for our vessels off of New Jersey. Existing data and our experience as fishing experts clearly show the need for a no-build area between the Atlantic Shores and Ocean Wind lease areas of sufficient width to accommodate two-way vessel transit in all conditions. The proposed spacing of one nautical mile or less will pose unacceptable safety risks to our vessels and crew.
 
USCG must conduct a cumulative safety analysis of all proposed lease sales in this region. If the Draft PARS moves forward as written all authority will rest with BOEM, which does not have navigational safety expertise. It is insufficient for USCG to defer to BOEM's review under the NEPA process, since that process never considers the cumulative safety or traffic effects of multiple offshore wind projects. We further request USCG and BOEM to meet with RODA and the NJ fishing industry to determine an effective approach to maintaining the paramount right of navigational safety for fishing vessels that accounts for all proposed and foreseeable offshore wind activities in the region.

My suggestion is keeping the NTM on the VHF full time because as an offshore fisherman once I’m offshore (assuming) I do not have SAT Internet, I can not receive updates via RSS. I do understand the radio clutter as docking, but my suggestion is to actually do both so one can lower the volume during docking yet crew members can still receive updates. My reasoning also for keeping the NTM is I know many older (60 years old and above) captains and mates that do not carry a mobile phone for updates while out to sea or sometimes at all. I feel that it poses a safety concern much like when driving a car on the road, you should not be looking at your phone and impacting situational awareness. Also, once it is phased out the captains (I) that are listening for it may  slowly forget overtime to check the phone for it and if we do not hear it on the radio then we may assume there is no NTM at all.

I forgive those who think that they are just cleaning out added work for the system by reducing the availability of Notices to Mariners, but please look at the real world practical side of this decision.  Many of us deliver boats, barges etc for the final users from one business location to another across our country, or from builders to consumers, and while doing so we are not in touch with wireless services other than the good old dependable VHF FM and the High Seas RT services that we have used for many, many past years of their services.  Please continue to provide these truly important services for the safety of our transits and the updating of our knowledge of what to expect as we go from district to district and climate to climate around our country.  And too, if you ad yet another service that must be monitored in order to continue on a safe course, we will need more hands on deck to continue to cover the present safe navigation demands as well as look at the new internet communications that come along due to ""Modernization"".  The road driving transportation industry calls this ""Distracted Driving""!.  Go ahead and add your new services if you care to, just economize by making them all come from the same source and your operational expenses should remain fairly constant.

Thank you for the opportunity to comment on our services received.  It is sort of sad to think that as time has gone by, the folks who ""improve"" our important services and who certificate our vessels have less and less real time experience in our industry as they rise into positions of control.  Do keep allowing us to comment on regulatory changes that affect how our industry can function as the value is mutual to both sides of our operations, regulatory and service.  Working together we can keep this a safe and functional industry of which we can all be proud.",,,,,,,

I am a younger mariner in my 30’s.
I have been in the river/ maritime industry for almost 15 years. Some people have complained about the BNM on VHF-16 as being a distraction. I have never heard of anyone being involved in an incident/ accident over hearing a BNM- on VHF-16.
I have heard of multiple incidents/ accidents from individuals being distracted by their phones, tablets, or other electronic devices. 
While I am thrilled about the information being available online, I also feel that it is pertinent to maintain these Broadcast as scheduled.
Not everyone has an electronic device available, but all Commercial Mariners should have a VHF Radio of some sorts. 
For those that find the broadcast as being distracting. They can simply turn the volume down while performing other critical task. That is what a prudent mariner would do in such situations.

I hope you take everyone’s comments into consideration before making a decision to discontinue this very important broadcast.

To the boaters who feel “ distracted “ by broadcasts, I suggest they push the off button, or
reduce the volume , before ch. 9 was put into heavy use, CG. 16 was a mess !
Is using both methods of distributing information an option ?

That is the now and the future and its always good to have multiple ways of communicating in case one goes down. 
  With that said, I do not think you should discontinue the use of communicating safety messages over VHF. I love to explore our inlets, rivers, and just places not many people go.... kind of a history buff here and always searching for lost history. There are places where a cell phone does not work and I always have a portable VHF on the boat.  VHF is a wide spectrum and there are many channels that are rarely used. Could you not just use another channel to broadcast safety messages?

The announcers are consistently unintelligible due to reading the Notice as fast as they can, with poor pronunciation. This makes it virtually impossible to transcribe the Notice. This issue of poor broadcast skills by USCG personnel extends beyond BNMs into more critical transmissions such as Securite and Pan -Pan notices.

The proposed rule highlights the benefits of the new grounds through elevating environmental stewardship, increasing navigation safety, and most of all, providing commercial vessel anchorage. They clarify that under specific executive orders that cost benefit analysis is typically required for regulation, but under this NPRM there is no designation of it being a significant regulatory action. I believe there can be very significant repercussions to this decision. The area has also been considered as a possible region for off shore wind turbine systems that would be producing renewable energy for the area. The environmental sustainability of this potential project would far exceed the potential economic and societal benefits of a new anchorage zone. Wilmington, NC is a densely populated area that holds for a large amount of energy use. By investing in wind turbines, the state could reallocate funds for the anchorage at an alternate location, at no inconvenience to the Coast Guard or commercial vessel. The lack of cost benefit analysis in this regulation is a serious abuse of discretion. In my review of this rule, I believe this needs to be considered a significant regulation and re-analyzed.

Draft: yes, restrictions on draft and or time restraints are used Worldwide. Daytime transits, speed restrictions, etc are a wise consideration.
Size & type of vessel: yes, both weight & length should be considered.
Weather: Yes, both Force & Visibility (fog, heavy rain) should be taken into transit restrictions.

      These area's of transit or redefining those present regulation's may not be rushed, above all areas of Worldwide vessel transit change, get redefined,

MSC ships conduct routine arrivals and departures at Naval Weapon Station Earle, NJ (NWSE) employing primarily three TSS’s, all considered adequate for Naval sealift transit.  In the vicinity of NWSE, MSC T-AKEs and T-AOEs routinely transit via the Terminal Channel, the Ambrose – Barnegat TSS, and less often, the Ambrose – Hudson Canyon TSS.  MSC ships rarely use the Ambrose – Nantucket TSS.  MSC does not anticipate any impact to NWSE operations as a result of the NNYPARS.
USN tug and salvage ships and T-EPFs occasionally transit to Long Island Sound and Newport, RI.  Towing and related operations in this area primarily consist of transit to and from New London, CT and Newport, RI.  NNYPARS will not affect MSC operations in this seaspace.
With respect to the Equinor Wind Energy Area and adjacent traffic separation schemes, ideally, wind turbines and other manmade hazards to navigation will be constructed well away from shipping lanes.  However, provided the development does not imping on existing TSS passage, MSC ships can transit to and from NYC without issue.

I am an owner, operator of a fishing trawler out of Stonington, CT. My follow up comments from the August 25, 2021 public hearing in regards to the Port Access Route Study For the New York Bight are as follows.
 
 I will start by saying that I do support all of the proposed fairways, which are suggested to be “no build zones”. However I do not feel that adequate consideration has be given to the needs for the fishing industry to safely operate. It all seems to me that the majority of the users of the waterway are being compressed into a much tighter area. I would like to see larger spacing of at least 2nm X 2nm in the actual turbine grids, and 4 mile fairways through them. Not only are my concerns for safety, but also being able to access the resources quickly and efficiently. 
 I have been in the industry for 25 years and have invested a great amount of money into it, I think at the very least fishermen should be able to maintain unrestricted access to our traditional fishing grounds.

Respectfully,
Daniel E Malone

I mentioned on a pervious hearing on this issue in the new proposed anchorage in the Delaware bay south of Brown shoal buoy I have sampled Large Adult Atlantic Sturgeon a listed species in a small area of unique hard bottom of ancient coral and rock that the sturgeons are feeding on , In our research efforts when our research team lavaged the animals they where feeding on small crabs and invertebrates on this unique hard bottom feature and moving forward we should not be dropping large anchors on or near the feature as it seems to be a feeding habitat most likely for 100s of thousands of years for these creatures and the health of this stock will directly effect measure introduced by NMFS relative to all commercial fisheries along the eastern seaboard . Many of the fish in this area are large and part of the spawning brood stock and we need to have concern for their welfare and habitat . This is a detailed subject and I will be happy to engage with anyone on this subject. Kevinwark@comcast.net.

That being said, the training needs to be consistent with the equipment and personnel the crew has available to perform the task.  Training provided needs to be relevant to the types of situations experienced.

The current approved courses taught in fire schools include equipment that is not required nor regularly available on inland towing vessels.  I have participated in these courses, as well as serving as a volunteer firefighter, and was grouped in with a bunch of offshore or SOLAS mariners fulfilling a separate requirement.  In our opinion it is dangerous and negligent to train people to fight fires with equipment such as structural firefighting gear and SCBAs and provide instruction on entering enclosed spaces to fight fires and performing search functions.  We are focusing on the wrong tactics and information.  In conversations with official trainers, they have told me they are constrained by insurance requirements to provide and utilize this equipment in these courses.

We believe we need to focus on certain training topics--Prevention, Fire Science, Safety, Basic Tactics, Required Equipment (including functional use and inspection) and federal requirements.  We believe this curriculum could be covered in a single day (8hr).  In this aspect we agree with the proposed amendment in scope of the required training to meet the equipment and capabilities available, required and provided.

There should be more than one avenue to fulfill this expectation much in the same way that the USCG decided there needed to be more than one way to meet the inspection needs of subchapter M.

1. Current training providers should be able to provide a shorter more on topic course.  The challenges with this would be their requirements by their insurance companies and the fact that there may not readily be enough towing vessel mariners available at a given time in a given region to facilitate timely organization of classes.  Geographic location of existing schools is also a challenge relative to the location of some of the smaller more remote towing vessel companies and personnel.  This provides an avenue for individual mariners to meet the requirement without depending on the company.  In this case a certificate would meet the requirement.

2. Companies should be able to assemble a curriculum and submit for approval of the course.  This curriculum may include inhouse trainers or trainers from local fire departments familiar with onboard fire fighting tactics and equipment.  There are a couple of challenges here.  The NMC would be the entity to approve the curriculum and they have a lot of work to do just to keep up with their regular duties.  The seem to be very challenged as of late with timeliness of processing regular credentials and consistency.  Adding a number of individual company approvals to their workload seems like it would further complicate an already stressed situation without diligent planning and a thorough evaluation of their current processes and resources.  This provides an avenue for individual companies that want to provide assistance to mariners but may not be close to or able to send mariners to schools located far away.  It also provides an avenue for local fire departments to establish a curriculum.  I foresee challenges in getting local fire departments that are willing and able to provide the training to go through the trouble of having the NMC decide whether to not these professionals are qualified to teach on their subjects of expertise.  They may simply decide to forego providing the training.  In any case this would result in issuance of a certificate.

3.. A towing company choosing the TSMS option for Sub M compliance should be able to assemble a curriculum that meets the expectations, needs and standards for the course material and have that training curriculum audited as part of their SMS by the TPO/ and or OCMI.  This provides a method for companies to develop and provide a curriculum specific to the equipment and resources available, audited by a third party.  In this case a company issued certificate and/or letter of designation style document would meet the certification requirements for the NMC.  They would simple need to keep a list of authorized companies, possible indicated by a letter from the TPO specifying the curriculum and ability to meet the requirement.

In summary, one size does not fit all and as already indicated by the USCG vs. TSMS option for Sub M compliance. Alternative avenues need to be kept open.  It is unreasonable to expect mariners without SCBAs, or even with as few as 2, to enter spaces, perform searches in smoke filled environments and assemble entry teams, RIT teams, etc.  Most towing vessels simply do not have enough personnel.  They need enough information to know what not to do and take basic steps for the safety of the crew.",,,,,,,

That looks like, what we local fisherman call, the ""fingers"" area, prime fluke,sea bass fishing grounds for both recreational and commercial pin-hookers. I have fished this bottom, both as a recreational fisherman and commercially for decades. 
  In addition, the residents of the city of Long Beach constantly complain on social media of the view from the beach and boardwalk of the tankers and freighters already anchored out between the shipping lanes waiting to enter the harbor.
 On the other hand, this is a major metropolitan area needing a never ending supply of goods either supplied by truck, train and ship. Freight carriers do need to park somewhere, right ?

Our family is waiting in traffic yet again on a Sunday evening at 6:45 PM. The traffic on Indian Creek has been constant ever since the on-demand schedule for weekends and nights has been implemented. It seems like the bridge is always up. It is terrible. It has sent a message to residents of Miami Beach that people in large boats are more important and have more rights than the thousands of us who live here and rely on the 63rd Street to get where we need to go—and the hundreds of us who are right now backed up in traffic north of 63rd Street as I write this. Please fix this situation. What we dealt with before the current regime was much, much better than this. How about raise the bridge once an hour on the hour?",,,,,,,

We can’t have on demand lifts. We have a tons of boats all day long that create huge traffic backups that can reach miles long in both directions that the city of Miami Beach can't sustain. The increase in boat traffic over the past 2 years has quadrupled. If if there is no scheduled lifts and it goes back to on demand we will have huge issues with life safety and ability to maneuver and use the roads. when the bridge opens the traffic backups, people cant get anywhere!. They cant get to work,  and can't get around the Miami Beach and the people cant even get bac their homes.  Not having scheduled lifts also creates huge life safety concerns. I live on Aqua on Alison Island and the amount of boats that use this waterway has quadrupled with as many as 30-50  boats in a day, Having a schedule is a better solution then to have on demand, and It would be great if we could  actually implement the same schedule as the weekdays. There is no time on this road when there is not a back up. Please I am begging your department to keep the lifts scheduled on the weekends.",,,,,,,

Even better, I fully support changing the schedule to 1x an hour rather than 2x an hour, especially on weekdays. Thank you for your consideration. ",,,,,,,

And no consideration here seems to be given to the land vehicle traffic being disrupted.  What if we had the same analogy for cars?  Can a car who is planning to transit the bridge request the bridge be closed whe he/she arrives?
A set schedule is required, but it should be no more often the once everyone 2 hours and no “on demand” openings during “prime time” hours, except for emergencies.

This is a 22 block stretch of waterway that this bridge services it should not encumber the residents of this community, nor the cities mercantile or emergency vehicles for multiple hours a day in the up position. At the very least the bridge should be in in the up position for a regulated/ limited amount of time  to not cause the traffic backups that occur for at least a mile. It is not fair to the cars, bicycles and pedestrians that are backed up for 20 minutes / the bridge goes down for 10 minutes and then up again. The cars do not have an opportunity to completely filter through so the traffic continues to back up with no respite. What has changed in the last 6 months to cause this awful traffic pattern at the bridge. We only suffered this congestion at boat show load in/out and that was ultimately adjusted to only occur in the evenings. This worked for the local residents. I believe that a more limited schedule of  bridge activity is required  and is necessary to keep boaters and vehicles and the Miami Beach community running smoothly and content. What happened to change the rhythm of the last 20+ years. Why do we have this additional boat traffic and what can be done to alleviate this bridge nightmare multiple times a day. ",,,,,,,

The bridge holds 200 to 300 autos stopped so one boat owner gets through.  This is the case where the needs of the ONE ( rich boat owner ) seem to outweigh the needs of the many (300 in queues).  

The business case is also pretty awful: calculate the time spent waiting for 250 driver as a loss in productivity and the fumes coming from 300 cars as damage to the environment so that ONE boat owner can go under the bridge. 

Lets look at the FLOW in this case the traffic flow.  The bridge opens ( 5 minutes ), the boat goes by ( 10 minutes ) the bridge closes (5 minutes), in those 20 minutes 300 cars build up.  Built up traffic drives over the bridges.  It takes 10 to 15 minutes.  Normal traffic for 5 to 10 minutes.  Cycle is repeated…

It’s insanity.

The bridge should open once every 60 to 90 minutes.  NEVER on demand.",,,,,,,

On the hour and half-hour is reasonable frequency for boater access, and is simple to remember for commuters. The total cycle time from bridge open to close should be no more than 4-5 minutes which is a reasonable delay for commuters and should not cause too much congestion.

Also, perhaps it would help alleviate traffic if the 63rd St turn signal was moved (or a timed warning light was added) further ahead of the bridge so that drivers have more ample notice that the bridge is about to go up. This might allow for more traffic to continue flowing south on Indian Creek Drive/Collins Ave towards 41 St (if your destination allows) rather than getting stuck within the plastic lane separator poles in the turn lanes. This would also help reduce driver frustration and mitigate chances of accidents caused by cars crossing the poles.",,,,,,,

It is bad enough that the bridge opens every half hour and at times delays traffic for 10-15 minutes (and then can reopen again less than 20 minutes later), but to not open on a regular schedule only makes things worse. Additionally, they bridge should not remain in the open position for several minutes to wait for a boat in the distance. Today, between 2:30-2:40 the bridge remained open while 3 minutes passed without a boat passing through. This is unacceptable. Traffic was backed up in both directions - probably to at least 67th St going south, and to LaGorce Country Club traveling north. Hundreds of cars should not be inconvenienced by 1 boat who doesn’t want to wait for the next scheduled opening - and the bridge operator should not allow these excessive delays. For the most part, these are pleasure boats whereas people in their cars more likely have chores to do. The boats should not get priority at the expense of the majority who are driving.
I recommend that a fixed schedule be in place 7 days a week where the bridge only opens on the hour and the half hour, if boats are waiting, and that it does not open during rush hour (7-9AM and 4-7PM) on weekdays. This schedule should be maintained 24 hours a day so drivers can anticipate when the bridge will be open and plan accordingly if there are alternate routes. I am also in favor of a “toll” for pleasure boats that inconvenience the rest of the public. If they own boats large enough to require the bridge to open, they can certainly afford to pay their fare share for inconveniencing everyone else.",,,,,,,

Below I will propose a few recommendations which I think will further improve the situation:
1)  The twice an hour schedule should be extended until 9pm during the weekends
2)  There should be a minimum waiting period of 30 minutes between on demand openings.  There should never be more than 2 openings per one hour period. 
3)  The duration of the bridge openings should be limited if possible.  There have been occasions where the bridge was open for more than 20 minutes, and when that occurs twice an hour, the bridge is open longer than it is closed.

The 3 recommendations listed above should also be incorporated into the weekday schedule, however the curfew period during the weekdays should not be altered, as it is very necessary and serves its intended purpose very well.

2. A weekday schedule should be implemented, as follows:
- the Bridge should open on the half hour and on the hour between 9am-7pm

Contrast this with the car traffic navigating over the bridge. A significant amount of the cars and trucks that utilize the bridge are commercial vehicles or inviduals headed to and from work or school. And while there may be other options for crossing Indian Creek (for example 41st street) realistically for most people who use that bridge it is by far the most expeditious route north on Miami Beach. I, for example, live on 53rd street and for me to have to go south to 41st and then north on Collins would double my commute time.

The situation is terrible and impacting our way of life. The party boat traffic on weekends continues to increase with seemingly no limit to accommodate the residents in this area. The concerns are expressed daily by my neighbors and there are many discussion panels on social media. Here are the concerns:

1. The bridge opening every 30 minutes is too often. Traffic builds and has little time to clear before the next bridge opening. 
2. Boat captains do not obey the no wake law of the canal.
3. Boat captains race for the bridge at unsafe speeds, many are larger than 60' motor yachts.
4. Boats play extremely loud music at all hours as they cruise the canal.
5. Residential boats are being damaged along the waterway from large wakes. (I have 2 neighbors that have had damage to their property as a direct result of large wakes. Both times the wakes cause boat lines to snap and a cleat to be ripped off)
6. Paddle boarders, kayakers, and the crew boats are in danger especially on weekends with heavy boat traffic.
7. The charter opportunities have spread to residential homes where private boats are chartered creating a business in otherwise quiet neighborhood on weekends.

I have lived on Miami Beach most of my life and have experienced many changes, most have improved our quality of life. This is a situation that needs to be addressed. Indian Creek Waterway is not a commercial cruising channel and should not be allowed to be used as one, except with special permitting for special events. The waterway needs to become less convenient with fewer bridge openings for less time. 

Thank you in advance.

We routinely now have to plan trips to the grocery store based on timing of the bridge and that is only when you know the schedule. On demand on weekends means the 63 street becomes unusable and backs traffic up repeatedly. The traffic jams on Indian Creek are almost constant ever since the on-demand schedule for weekends and nights has been implemented. It seems like the bridge is always up. It is terrible. It has sent a message to residents of Miami Beach that people in large boats are more important and have more rights than the thousands of us who live here and rely on the 63rd Street to get where we need to go—and the hundreds of us who are right now backed up in traffic north of 63rd Street as I write this. Please fix this situation. What we dealt with before the current regime was much, much better than this. How about raise the bridge once an hour on the hour and have this posted on the bridge with a contact number in case the rule is not being followed. The boats also speed through the canal and several boats have been significantly damaged that are tied down along the route. Please put up signs at multiple points that say ""No wake"" and put up cameras to catch speeders. The rowing club is there and this is a terrible accident waiting to happen. The blaring music is another issue. This happens late into the night. Please add an audio component to the camera to catch this group that ""invades"" our peace and quiet.

One advantage of having the one-hour, half hour schedule on Federal holidays is that it is the same rule as weekends.  Consistency in the application of the rule for weekends and Federal holidays allows boat owners to remember the rule more easily.    Additionally, II note that the bridge is located at Miami Beach's waspish thin waist.  Only one vehicle alternative exists - Collins Avenue.   Moreover, boats that need more than 11 feet to pass under the bridge are really yachts.   Allowing a few people on a yacht to have the bridge opened on their demand during Federal holidays is unfair to the hundreds of motorists who are forced to wait every time a yacht approaches the bridge.

We are in favor of any rule and regulation that would make the 63rd Street (Indian Creek) bridge schedule reasonable for the residents in the neighborhoods that are affected by the traffic congestion that is created by the existing schedule. Toward that end, we believe that the bridge tender should only open the bridge once each hour, on the top of each hour, between the hours of 8am and 11pm, seven days week, for six minutes at a time, if there is a need for any waiting boats. The reasoning is quite simple. It is a matter of utilitarianism. The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few. Particularly in this situation. This bridge is a critical artery for motorists on Miami Beach. I believe the number of motorists daily is in the thousands. When the bridge is raised, especially during heavy traffic periods, the traffic is backed up for several blocks on PineTree Drive (which is one-way northbound). This congestion motivates some drivers to cut across to LaGorce to return to 41st Street or find other shortcuts through the neighborhood. Sometimes these motorists drive the wrong way on LaGorce, which is one-way southbound. This is dangerous. There are few boats that are actually moored south of the bridge that require the bridge to be elevated. Meaning, there are only a few residents in the PineTree/LaGorce neighborhood who live on Indian Creek who actually own such large boats. The majority of the large boats that traffic this area of Indian Creek are non-resident boat owners who like to take this scenic detour to gawk at the water-side homes and the condominiums that line Indian Creek between 41st and 63rd streets. It is scenic. But sightseeing boaters should not have a priority, or even be treated equally, with motorists and the property owners in this area. The traffic congestion and consequences of it due to the current and prior bridge schedules disrupts the PineTree/LaGorce, Allison Island, North Alton, and LaGorce Island neighborhoods. Allowing the bridge to be raised once hourly, for a period of no more than six minutes, will alleviate the traffic, and force boaters, most of whom are non-residents of the affected neighborhoods, to adapt their schedules to this reasonable schedule.",,,,,,,

I definitely DO NOT want to see ""on-demand"" for weekend days 7am-7 pm.

My background: I am both a homeowner at 6620 Allison Road and a boat owner with a boat kept at the dock of my home, so the issue of the bridge impacts me personally every day and all times of the day and often determines whether or not I will use a business on the easternmost shore. From a homeowner perspective, I support timed fixed bridge openings and do not support ""on demand"" openings. As a boat owner too, I support fixed bridge openings and do not support ""on demand"" openings. 

Currently, I have to sit in extensive eastbound traffic on Alton Road made worse by bridge openings every single day and evening just to be able to gain access to my street so that I can get home. After the weekday schedule was limited for morning and afternoon, there was vast improvement of local Alton Road traffic flow and my use of businesses on the eastern corridor increased. On the weekends and evenings, I can't even leave my home at the base of the bridge on the west side then drive over the bridge and circle back without waiting for 2 separate bridge openings, both on my outbound and return. That's insane. I have seen the bridge closed for only one cycle of traffic through the intersection before it opened again. I would bet $$ there are hours when the bridge is open more than it is closed.
 
Based on the ""on demand"" schedule I endure at times outside the weekday restrictions, I support any plan that adds fixed times and further restricts ""on demand"" openings. Opening the bridge severely limits my movement away from and returning to my home so if it were up to me, I would never have ""on demand"" at any time. ",,,,,,,

Other than in an emergency, that bridge should operate on a posted set schedule .. local residents & boat operators will easily adapt and deal.  Once an hour .. on the hour (if there’s a boat waiting) .. seems more than generous.

The 63rd Street bridge effects one of these roads. The average time the bridge is up is 10 mins each time it raises. Since traffic is heavily effected specially during rush hours it may add another 5-10 minutes to get over the bridge. It has taken me 30 minutes to go over the bridge from 71 Street going south. The boat traffic is over almost all coming from charter boats docked at the Fountainbleu Hotel. These boats can 
easily plan there time thru the bridge. I think the best solution is to open the bridge on an hourly schedule ( leaving traffic access 50 minutes). All boat traffic can adjust to that schedule during the week and on the half hour Saturday/Sunday and national holidays for the hours 9-1PM and 4-6PM since the charter operators book ½ day and full day charters. Right now 90% of the time I get stuck with the bridge opening and it has become a major inconvenience. In addition the amount of fuel being burnt by the lines of vehicles wanting to go over the bridge is adding to additional pollution and costs. The situation need to be resolved and the bridge must be put on a schedule and no on demand during daylight hours.

I occasionally request drawbridges to open in South Florida for my own boat.
Over the past decades, the average tide level has risen somewhat requiring the 63rd Street bridge to open for more vessels.  Over the same time, the average size (height) of vessels has increased as well.   This increase in vessel size has been particularly dramatic during the Covid-19 epidemic.  The result is more vessels requiring more openings.  
It is not uncommon for there to be five or more vessels on each side of the bridge requiring passage.  The result is routine durations of 10 to 20 minutes from the time of the first opening signal until the gates open.  Combined with traffic buildup, cars wanting to cross the bridge can regularly be forced to wait 15 to 25 minutes for the bridge opening.
It seems grossly unjust and contrary to good public policy to force hundreds of people to wait 20 minutes or longer (keeping them from work, home, family, deliveries and emergency response) while someone who by definition has leisure time passes under the bridge unfettered.  For comparison, you could save many man hours of motorist time by forcing a boat to wait until the next scheduled opening, which would cost the boat operators far fewer man hours.
Based on the foregoing, I strongly support the limited schedule of bridge opening at the 63rd street bridge.  I believe that opening only on the hour or less frequently is justified and could allow motorists to plan better.

The drawbridge has always been a fixture of living here. Over the last several years the drawbridge has become an absolute nuisance to residents. The bridge goes up allegedly twice per hour, but the congestion is so incredibly bad, the traffic bleeds into each other, never dissipating for hours on end. I have personally stopped going to the north end of Miami Beach because on multiple occasions it has taken me over an hour to go 4 miles. This is all for the sake of one or two boats. I have also seen emergency vehicles stuck in that traffic, unable to move, unable to assist whomever they were going to. Additionally, if you attempt to travel Miami Beach on a bicycle, the traffic this bridge creates is dangerous. This has to end.  Hundreds of people’s time should not be held hostage by one or two boats.

I personally believe, that like Brickell Bridge, this bridge should not be permitted to go up between 4:30 and 6:00 pm, and between 8:00 am and 9:30 am. Additionally, the bridge should not go up more than one time per hour. Hundreds of people are regularly negatively impacted by a few. This has to stop.

Drawbridge Operation Regulation; Indian Creek, Miami Beach, FL

Thank you for the opportunity to participate in the public comments with regard to this important topic.
I ask that you please consider the following in your decision making. 
1.	Bridges over navigable waters including movable bridges, have been historically considered hazards to navigation. The context of that statement is that our country and most of the modern world was discovered and devolved by men is ships (Mariners). Henry Hudson did not await a bridge opening.
2.	The US Code title 33  and the Code of Federal Regulation title 33 deal with Navigation and Navigable Waters. Sub chapter J 117.5 “Except as otherwise authorized or required by this part, drawbridges must open promptly and fully for the passage of vessels when a request or signal to open is given in accordance with this subpart.”
3.	The exceptions cited in the above regulation is 117.33 Closure of draw for natural disasters or civil disorders. 117.35 Temporary change to a drawbridge operating schedule 117.36 Closure of drawbridge for emergency repair.
4.	Schedules imposed on Specific Bridges as allowed by USC 33 499 Regulations for drawbridges when authorized shall be listed in CFR 33 117 Subpart B Specific Requirements. 
5.	The law authorizing regulations to be promulgated on draw bridges are to consider “  Provided further, That any regulations made in pursuance of this section may be enforced as provided in section 413 of this title, the provisions whereof are made applicable to the said regulations. Any rules and regulations made in pursuance of this section shall, to the extent practical and feasible, provide for regularly scheduled openings of drawbridges during seasons of the year, and during times of the day, when scheduled openings would help reduce motor vehicle traffic delays and congestion on roads and highways linked by drawbridges.” As cited in USC 499 (a) (a) Criminal penalties for violations; enforcement; rules and regulations
6.	In this rare case the consideration of motor vehicle traffic delay and congestion is a valid consideration, unlike the arbitrary mandate set on Bridges 24-7, which impose restriction without the benefit of relief traffic delays and congestion, as there is limited traffic overnight at 3:00AM. those overbearing regulations impede traffic on the MTS (Marine Transportation System)
7.	This bridge 63 Street Bridge, which crosses Indian Creek had undergone rehabilitation in 2006. It was suggested at that time the total replacement of the bridge and the construction of a more practical bridge with higher vertical clearances, and multiple traffic lanes. The measure was defeated by the residents who favored historical preservation. 
8.	The Maritime community endured complete extended shutdowns of that bridge for that period, and numerous restrictions imposed for a wide variety of reasons like boat shows, marathons. 

As a commercial small passenger vessel operators engaged in commerce, we respectfully request again for the consideration of the following language be included in CFR 33 117.293  Exempt vessels: This term means public vessels of the United States and tugs with tows and commercial vessels or Inspected small passenger vessels must be passed through the drawspan of each drawbridge listed in this section at any time.
Note: The current language in the regulations does not provide an exception for public vessels or tugs. I don’t think the intent was to have the Coast Guard or law enforcement wait for an opening. Professional credentialed mariners take their careers very seriously. Safety is paramount when vessels carrying passengers have delayed openings, outside influences such as wind, current, vessel traffic all play a huge part in safety. Just as other surface transportation operators are given special consideration for safety, Professional mariners would streamline the passage of the vessel through the spans thus minimizing the opening. 
At the end of the day business is to be disrupted, whether it be the merchant on the beach side, the country club on the island side or even the hospitals nearby all are for profit business which could be impacted by the delays, who is to judge how the impact will be delivered equitably. Our impacts rightfully should be considered.

As a Miami Beach resident, that lives overlooking the Bay, every time we go to the beach ( 2-3 times/week) we have to cross this drawbridge. Almost every time, we get caught waiting for it to open because a vessel is going through . And every time it takes 15-20 minutes out of our day. While waiting, you always observe at least 50 cars on each direction waiting. Which at minimum is 100 people. People going to work, running errands, taking care of every day life , that have to work,waiting  and wasting valuable time so a very small number of people on a boat on their leisure time don’t have to wait . Doesn’t this seem backwards to you? It inconsiderate, selfish and honestly inefficient. People on boats should be the ones waiting, and plan to be at the bridge at a set schedule, preferably on the hour, to avoid disruptions to people on the ground . And not only on the weekends, because during regular work days, people on the ground need predictability, so they can plan their commute accordingly around the drawbridge schedule. 
Thank you for allowing me to express my concern and frustration over this matter, that has gone on for far too long unchecked.

Now, related to the openings every half an hour. I believe is a bit much, and worse on weekends. Opening every hour on the spot could be better than what is implemented at the moment.

The weekday schedule closes the bridge for 3 hours in the morning and 3 hours in the evening, to accommodate ""rush hour"" traffic.  I am a resident of LaGorce Palace which overlooks the bridge.  I am also a sailor, but I do not personally use this waterway.  When a person chooses to live in a waterfront community, there are benefits and responsibilities to the community.  The use of the waterways is an integral part of our neighborhood, for both personal and commercial vessels on the water.  The weekend is much busier on the waterway and boaters deserve the same respect and accommodation on the weekends that motor vehicles enjoy during the week.  I have traveled up and down the eastern seaboard by boat many times, and have also operated a motor vehicle in waterfront communities throughout Florida and the eastern US.  Residents can plan their travel according to the bridge schedule.  There are alternate routes between Miami Beach and the city of Miami.  Boating is a major draw for both visitors and prospective residents.  People complain about the 63rd street bridge as if boaters have no right to use the waterway.  I think a schedule on the weekends, to open on the hour and half hour between 7 am and 7 pm is ok, but not a prolonged closure from 7-10 and 4-7 as is imposed on the weekdays.

Please consider keeping the opening restriction to a “timed” versus “on demand” basis. A few reasons,

- As you know, everyone from across the country is moving to Miami and the traffic in that area is already very bad
- The bottleneck when the bridge opens creates gridlock that goes back to almost a mile north on Indian Creek Dr 
- It's difficult for people to plan their day when they are trying to get to work, get their kids to school, or to the airport if the bridge is on deman
- Lastly, imagine someone having an emergency and trying to get to Mt. Sinai Hospital and not being able to cross the bridge.

The change from on demand to scheduled helped.  The problem is the amount of charter boat traffic catering to out of town visitors.  The obscenity laced extremely loud music and marijuana is very apparent all weekend long.  There are at least 10 boast of 40 ft and above per opening.  The bridge is open for 15 minutes and then reopens 15 minutes later on the weekends in the operators attempt to open on the half hour. Boats are not obeying the no wake and we have personally experienced boat damage from large wakes.  So have 2 of my neighbors.  Maybe the solution is to have on demand limited to once/hour on the weekends to limit the extreme traffic back associated with multiple openings within 20 minutes of each other as currently observed.  The other bigger issue is the unregulated charter business from boats coming down Indian Creek to pick up large groups on people on Collins closer to 50th street.  The charter comes south down the waterway and then heads north back up the waterway after picking up their customers.  The charter then returns to drop off and then leaves again for their home port.  That amounts to 4 trips and 4 openings for every visiting charter boat.  The excessive traffic for the charter boats is the catalyst behind the long openings and excessive traffic.  The solution is to better restrict the charter boats from driving down the waterway to then pick up visitors along the Collins ave seawall.  Why not prevent pick ups for boats that are not paying for dock space on Collins?  Marine patrol would have an easier time preventing illegal docking and pickup then trying to reign them in on the waterway.  If not possible, another possible remedy would be to require displayed stickers for the charter business.  If Marine Patrol does not see a sticker on one of these large boats that are full of people, the Maine Patrol would have the right to issue a ticket for operating an illegal charter.  I don't know which is easier to implement.  I would think eliminating the pick up would drop the boat traffic by at least half and solve the other issues.  Mike Smith",,,,,,,

There is no reason that a single vessel should have priority ""on demand"" while inconveniencing hundreds or even thousands of people on a daily basis.  The Coast Guard should operate all bridges on a schedule, and importantly, bridge operators should adhere to that schedule.  The East Bascule bridge on the Venetian Islands has an operating schedule but bridge operators frequently open the bridge off-schedule for pleasure boaters.  Particularly in the evenings when vehicular, biking, and pedestrian traffic is at a high point, Venetian bridge operators will open the bridge ""on demand"" up to several times per half-hour.  This is in direct conflict with the official opening schedule.

For the last 3 years and more recently this past year and a half the boat traffic has increased enormously and the openings are more frequent than ever,  disrupting my daily routine. Taking my children to the school or to a doctor appointment or just to buy groceries it is now a much more time consuming task but what it is unbearable is the noise! there are more party boats than ever that use the 63rd street canal blasting the music at any time of the day and night....Even us on the west side can be woken up from our sleep at night when these boats are waiting for the bridge to open and cruising all the way by Allison Island side on their way out and in. We understand that there are more tourist and more boats visiting our city but the music shouldn't be allowed until the boats are in the sea or at the bay far enough from the residential areas. Why is it not allowed to have blasting music in our homes past midnight and these boats disrupt our days and nights every week?

We are in support of the proposed rule change to limit the opening to the hour and half hour.

As homeowners at AQUA on Allison Island adjacent to the bridge, we experience daily the frustrating impact on vehicular traffic of the frequent opening of this bridge.  And while the impact on vehicular traffic of the twice hourly schedule is significant, it is nothing compared to what an on-demand rule would cause.  

As boat owners who require the bridge to be opened in all but dead low tide, the idea of restricting the opening further to an hourly schedule as proposed by other commenters is concerning.  Not only is it undesirable and an undue burden to have to wait up to an hour in order to navigate from our residence, but the current pilot schedule of twice hourly openings on the weekend already sees such a volume of vessels waiting for openings so as to create hazardous boating conditions.  Reducing this further would only exacerbate this condition.

The solution to this problem is not just in managing the operating schedule of the bridge, but more importantly in decreasing the demand for such opening.  We have seen firsthand the changes in the volume and type of marine traffic in the recent past.  During peak times (between 10 AM and 7 PM) on the weekends, it is rare that the bridge does not open on both the hour and half hour due to an unprecedented volume of marine traffic.  This traffic has shifted from a mostly residential population to an overwhelming commercial population of charter boats, many of which are not local to the area and thus require the bridge to open four times in the course of navigating to hotels south of the bridge to pick up passengers, traveling back through the bridge towards Biscayne Bay, returning passengers to their point of embarkation, and returning to their home port.  The agencies concerned should be aggressively monitoring and policing such traffic to ensure boaters are complying with all applicable rules and regulations, including noise ordinances, possession of commercial charter licenses and adherence to the provisions of such licenses, and appropriate use of docks south of the bridge according to their operating permits granted by DERM.  Reducing this traffic would alleviate the demand for bridge openings and greatly reduce the impacts on vehicular traffic.",,,,,,,

As others have commented, I believe this should be implemented for weekends and weekday similar to what is done in neighboring cities and Broward County.  I would also appreciate more data to support the numbers of boats and times the bridge is raised.

Lastly I would propose evaluating the time it takes the bridge operator to complete the entire bridge open to re-open cycle.  I myself have timed it at 15 minutes -- for just one boat to pass.  Too much time is wasted for the stoplight signal, to ringing the bells, blasting the horn, to lowering the gates, to raising the bridge, allowing the boat to pass, then blasting the horn, lowering the bridge, ringing the bells, raising the gates that allow traffic to proceed.  We can certainly be more efficient than 15 minutes.

I find that almost every time I need to cross the bridge, it is open, holding up hundreds (or maybe even thousands) of motorists to allow a boat of maybe three or four individuals to pass under. This is mostly due to the fact that the 63rd Street Drawbridge functions “on demand”. As you can imagine, this is very counterintuitive as it promotes the movement of a few over the movement of many. I propose that the drawbridge NOT be allowed to open “on demand”, but to open once every hour so as to allow the motorists to get to where they need to go while also allowing a time frame in which the boats can pass under the bridge without causing too much traffic interruption.",,,,,,,

As a resident of a building less than 1000 yards south of the bridge we've been deeply impacted by the change in the operation of the bridge. What you should know is that boats get queued up in the creek heading north waiting for the bridge to open. I've counted as many as 10 to 15 boats and yachts. Before the bridge opens most of these yachts are charters and have as many as 20 people on them, playing extremely loud music echoing in the corridor while they wait.  When the bridge opens there is a mass exodus to get though the bridge and the most serious issue is the extreme wake that is created as they all move together to squeeze through the underpass. As a board member I have witnessed extreme damage to our seawall as some of these ""waves"" actually breach the top of our seawall.  It is seriously eroding the embankment and it must stop. There has also been damage done to boats in our docks from the extreme wakes that are generated by the mass exodus of boats going both ways. The worse case is when a large yacht is in the back of the pack thinks they may miss the opportunity and have to wait another 30 minutes, they up their speed and power through creating havoc and damage to our docks, sea wall, and boats and sea life.

When I first moved here there were very few boats passing through the 63rd Street Bridge.  We had the Biscayne Lady which sailed through twice a day and a beautiful, amazing parade of boats and yachts for the annual boat show every February.  It seems after the cancellation and loss of the Miami Boat Show and the effects of limiting large mass gatherings due to Covid-19 we were given charter club bar boating.  For months we have listened to the 63rd Street Bridge opening and closing for many boats. Sometimes 15-20 boats pass through in one opening.  (More than the boat show ever had!)  These charter boats play loud, offensive, crude music, move at speeds above the allowed wake zone, break up the protected seawalls, disrupt sea life, pollute the water quality, cause wear and tear to the bridge and traffic jams. Our Indian Creek waterway has been flooded with the new creation of the bar club in the waters. As a resident I find it is invasive and I do not want a club bar in my home. Where are these charter boats going?  They can not meet the height restrictions to go all the way down the creek or out to the bay.  The only way in and out for these charter boats is through the 63rd Street Bridge.  A pilot study needs to be conducted without charter boats to establish the bridge opening needs for residents living along Indian Creek.  How many residents along the creek have boats and docks?  100? 200?  Let's see what the bridge opening usage is of local, voting, tax paying residents.  The problem is not the time openings of the bridge.  It is the allowance of charter boats.  What business is chartering the boats?  Why has the City of Miami Beach looked away from its residents and not addressed the charter boat business and the effects on residents.  Where are you Biscayne Lady?  Beautiful Dolphins and Manatees what new peaceful location have you swam to? Maybe we tax paying residents should follow you. This charter boat business is a sad situation for Indian Creek and all its residents.  This is not the peaceful, beautiful Miami Beach I moved to 12 years ago.  Please, let's address the charter boat business that is going on in our Indian Creek waterways!  Once that is solved there may be little concern about bridge openings.  Thank you.",,,,,,,

While I don't have a problem with coordinating the bridge reopening start with the Port Mayaca lock, it would seem only reasonable to allow boaters coming off the Lake headed to Stuart, to be able to pass the bridge before it switches to normally closed. If the locking operations finish at 5PM, the bridge should remain open (except for train crossings) until 6PM. The alternative might be to have the bridge operator contact the Port Mayaca Lock operator at 4:30 pm for any East bound traffic in the lock.

My second comment is about signage. Posting the bridge name, VHF and phone number information one mile before the bridge (or when the bridge is first visible from the waterway) would greatly reduce congestion in the narrow channel at the bridge. The bridge often doesn't open after a train crossing until the first boat requests it. Being able to have the bridge information before reaching the bridge would allow contact to be made and the opening process to be started without boat(s) collecting at the bridge. While flow in the waterway isn't normally a problem,  during periods of extreme high Lake levels, water dumping down the St. Lucie river can make waiting for the railroad bridge opening more challenging because of the narrow waterway.

First, there is next to no information on what exactly the NGA or Coast Guard mean by “conducting U.S. Government training and systems testing” – is this seismic or sonar testing? Is it related to mapping the ocean floor, or testing military weapons? What is the purpose of the information expected to be gained – surveillance, safety, environmental protection? Are there any concerns to marine life? Why is one of the concerns cited potential terrorist attacks? Is there a concern to Ocean City residents as this is less than a dozen nautical miles from the shore? I believe a lot more transparency is necessary as to what exactly a temporary security zone means, and why this isn’t just classified as a safety zone? Second, I have read several local Maryland news articles which voice concerns from the local fisheries as they were hoping to utilize that area at the same time that COVID-19 restrictions are lifting, and state that it does affect the local sea bass fishing area - could you please provide more information on how you all came to the conclusion that the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, which requires agencies to consider the potential impact of regulations on small business and entities, was satisfied? Third, the analysis included which determined that the Proposed Rule “would not have a substantial direct effect on one or more Indian tribes, on the relationship between the Federal Government and Indian tribes, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities between the Federal Government and Indian tribes” appears weak – can you confirm that no Indigenous fisheries have been affected by this temporary security zone? I believe much more information needs to be provided to members of the public before the Coast Guard can make this decision. The point of Notice and Comment is so that the public is on notice, right now we are not sufficiently aware of the purposes and procedures occurring between April 25 and May 8, 2021. ",,,,,,,

My comment comes as an employee of the Marine Chart Division in NOAA. We are responsible for updating nautical charts, including security zones established by the Coast Guard. I am submitting feedback in this regard on the proposed rulemaking on Security Zones; Sabine Pass Channel, Cameron, LA. Refer to Federal Register / Vol. 86, No. 112 / Monday June 14, 2021 / Pages 31459-31460 / Docket Number USCG-2021-0120.

I have been assigned to evaluate this Federal Register proposed ruling. I am a nautical cartographer with the Nautical Data Branch / Marine Chart Division / Office of Coast Survey / National Ocean Service / NOAA.

The proposed ruling states that the security zone in CFR 165.819, The Security zone in Sabine Pass LNG, Cameron Parish, in paragraph (ii) will have modified coordinates, and a second security zone will be established in an adjacent basin that is under construction. 
In order to ensure that all the information is provided to properly evaluate these features and coordinates for charting, my feedback for these zones is to explicitly state the horizontal datum alongside the coordinates provided for each zone. There additionally appears to be a small spelling error of ""shoreward"" in the above referenced paragraph (ii) section (A) in the first sentence, ""All mooring basin waters horeward"".

Thanks,
Ben Galdi

My perspective is from operational experiences.

I understand your solution must address many issues:  Organizationally, System-wise and people (both VIP and non-VIP).  Your Coast Guards mission includes first responders and minimizing loss of life.  Your partner agencies missions protect VIP's, safeguard the financial structure of the US (SS), infrastructure and even include (DHS) chemical facility inspector.

Based on the frequency in the 1st four months of 2021 of eight (4 round) trip; the announcement that the VIP's one-term pledge is now two (8 years);  the VIP quotes of preferring their home over federal residence; previously commuted 3 days per week;  then it is certainly reasonable and required to get the CBO involved as the $100 million reporting barrier will be easily exceeded.

Note: The City of Wilmington said in one month alone they had $120,000 additional costs due to VIP.  Marine one reimbursement is listed as $25000/hour.  Even the British said a single year of protection to the now former prince and princess was $5MM.

Please reconsider marine one as the routine commuter service for VIP rather than plane- auto combination trips. It would be faster overall for the VIP and not limited to one path or street.  It allows flight crews an option of returning home the same day.

Helicopters have few flight path restrictions.  I hear the house adjacent to the VIP home had a recent (4/26) hostage/ barricade situation.  No doubt you could acquire this adjacent site, use it for additionally agents and land the helicopter there.  This would save thousands of overburdened local workers, parents and travelers the 1 hour delays already experienced each time.

Other facts you may not recall.  The I-495 bypass around Wilmington in Delaware was shut down or restricted to 1 lane for ten years due to a gasoline tanker explosion.  The portion of the 141 bridge and River are adjacent to two hazardous and potentially catastrophic businesses: BAxx and Air Lxxxxx. Whether their operations are continuous or batch, shutting down such chemical processes on short notice is hazardous and would be financially devastating if done routinely.

The more you protect something the more it becomes a target.  Have you ever visited the 2nd largest state house in Madison, Wisconsin?  They have very few guards and  some cameras.  When I finally found a guard and asked him about the perceived lack of security, he said, ""it's the people's house.  They are free and allowed to visit"".  No recent incidents. So if you only protect the bridge and surrounding chemical businesses with the coast guard during trips; it becomes a target unless you secure it 24/7/365. Just put in some cameras. 

Best regards

A concerned citizen

I am a Pilot with the SE Alaska Pilots' Association, but I make my home in Washington.  I am in opposition to two of the three choices, as the two that would displace the maritime training school MITAGS would have a direct affect on my ability to conduct Pilot Training, Pilot Examinations, and ongoing training. There are no other world class simulators or institutions with the knowledge, skills and abilities that MITAGS has on the entire west coast, let alone the PNW. The school's current location is perfect for their mission, convenient for those of us traveling from out of state, and has already invested heavily in their infrastructure, which I can imagine would be very difficult to replicate in another location. Should MITAGS shut its doors, we would have to travel to the east coast, spending our dollars outside of the region, and honestly, getting a subpar product. Therefore, I request that the DOHS consider options that would NOT displace MITAGS.",,,,,,,

In addition to mitigation measures to protect Elliott Bay and its fisheries, I suggest you incorporate public education into your project scope.

Although currently on pause, I expect the Port of Seattle will eventually build a new cruise ship terminal at the north half of Terminal 46. An expanded USCG base onto the south half of that terminal could not only complement a cruise ship terminal, combined they could anchor the south end of Seattle's new makeover of the central waterfront. See attached newspaper article for photos, and imagine visually anchoring the south end of the artists' depictions.

The USCG is the most often overlooked branch of the United States military, especially here in Seattle. Whatever rebuilding you do in this project, it should help to rectify that with a public education welcoming center. History displays and interactive screens could explain the range of important services the USCG provides in Puget Sound, the Gateway to Alaska, and the entire 13th District.  The Klondike Gold Rush National Historical Park could be a partner with USCG and the Port in this, along with other maritime and fishing organizations. USCG recruiting should participate also. If you want public support for your budgets, you must show the public what they are getting for their tax dollars!

Lastly, I urge you to work with the City of Seattle's Waterfront Redevelopment on integrating your project with theirs.  I would love to see USCG incorporate a major artwork welcoming people to the new waterfront. This would be an opportunity to pay tribute to local Native American tribes, the first seafarers who plied these waters.

Good luck with your project!

RE:  Base Seattle PEIS Public Comment

To whom it may concern:

We the undersigned Captain Eric vonBrandenfels, from the Puget Sound Pilots are writing in support of the Maritime Institute of Technology and Graduate Studies “MITAGS” (formerly known as Pacific Maritime Institute), located at 1729 Alaskan Way South in Seattle.

We understand that the Department of Homeland Security has proposed a modernization of Coast Guard Base Seattle, in which two of the three options require the school to be removed.  Although we fully support the Coast Guard’s need to modernize, there needs to be some accommodation in order not to lose the school.  This could be to select an option that allows the school to remain, or provide financial assistance for moving the school to a nearby location and properly outfitting the facilities. 

MITAGS provides US Coast-Guard-required safety and survival training to mariners, who often serve as emergency first responders aboard their vessels.  We depend on MITAGS’ first aid, survival, firefighting, hazardous materials, and other emergency response courses to help our employees react appropriately and minimize the risk to life and property.

The School is equipped with three advanced ship and tug simulators.   Mariners use the simulators to enhance their skill sets for safe navigation.  The training greatly mitigates the risks of groundings, collisions, and allisions.  MITAGS also offers an award-winning Navigation Skills Assessment Program, NSAP®.  This program helps maritime companies pre-qualify deck officers prior to employment and evaluate the skills of officers already in service. 

Pilot organizations, including the Puget Sound Pilots, use MITAGS to help select and train their personnel.  They also regularly use the simulators for navigation studies to evaluate whether it is safe and under what conditions for new vessel classes to transit. 

MITAGS is a significant asset to the Pacific Northwest.  In addition to training local mariners, it serves as an economic engine that draws professional mariners from all over the world.  Its services cannot be obtained anywhere else in the region.   If MITAGS was to shut its doors, it would negatively impact the local and regional maritime community.

In summation, MITAGS provides essential maritime services.  We respectfully request that the DOHS consider options that would ensure this important maritime asset remains part of the Seattle Maritime Community.

Sincerely,
Eric vonBrandenfels Puget Sound Pilot

Puget Sound Pilots is a local association of 52 state and federally licensed marine pilots who are the main providers of pilotage services to commercial vessels that call within the Puget Sound area. As State licensed pilots we are mandated by the Legislature of Washington State to provide waterborne commerce with safe navigation within the waters of our State. Each member of the association holds a State Pilotage license, as well as being a USCG licensed Master and the requisite First Class Pilotage Endorsements for the area. The service we provide is to ensure the safe passage of every deep draft foreign vessel, the majority of deep draft U.S. flag vessels, to and from the berths and anchorages of our district, from the Canadian border south through to Olympia.
Puget Sound Pilots holds in high regard the significant role the Coast Guard provides in our region. We understand the needs of the Coast Guard to modernize their facilities in Seattle. However, we have concerns regarding the unintended impacts an expansion may create. Our primary concern with the proposed expansion and modernization of the USCG Base Seattle is with creating further restrictions of the navigable width of the East Waterway.  Alternatives 2 and 3 of the PEIS involve construction of new berths in and on the approaches to the East Waterway.  The proposed new berth in the waterway would be located adjacent to busy container piers and an oil terminal on Harbor Island.  Over the last several years the size of ship that regularly calls on the berths of East Waterway have increased dramatically minimizing the maneuvering room necessary to safely navigate the waterway. The reconstruction of the piers and their eventual use for mooring vessels could constrict the navigable waterway further, thereby increasing the risks when mooring tankers and large container vessels in the waterway.  As the proposals are described, alternative 1 would still reduce the navigable area, though it would be potentially less restrictive for vessel transits in the waterways than alternatives 2 or 3. 
Puget Sound Pilots looks forward to further discussions regarding the modernization of the Coast Guard Homeport in the Seattle area.  Please feel free to contact us for further discussion.

Kind Regards,

Docket Number USCG-2021-0183

To Whom it may concern,
I am a member of the Puget Sound Pilots Association and one of the training pilots responsible for training pilots in our district.
I am very happy to hear that the department of Homeland Security intends to update and expand the Coast Guard base in Seattle and fully support the mission of the Coast Guard as well as the improvement of the Seattle base.
In reviewing the proposed plans, I would like to express concern for the displacement of the Maritime Institute of Technology and Graduate Studies “MITAGS” (formerly known as the Pacific Maritime Institute) required by options 2 and 3 in the notice.  MITAGS is the most prominent maritime training school in the Pacific Northwest and serves a critical role in providing required regulatory as well as on-going professional training for mariners in the Northwest region and beyond.  I have attended training at the MITAGS facility throughout my career.  As a training pilot for Puget Sound Pilots, I can assure you that MITAGS provides an unparalleled simulator facility in the region with three high-tech ship’s bridge simulators as well as other resources that are critical to the Puget Sound Pilot’s mission to protect the citizens, environment, and economy of the Pacific Northwest.  The MITAGS facility is used by the Puget Sound Pilots for everything from license exam evaluations to tanker escort training, large container ship training and other critical training supporting the front-line role of the pilots in maintaining safe pilotage in the region.
Once again, I am pleased to see and fully support the plans to expand and improve the Seattle Coast Guard base.  With that said, I strongly request that the MITAGS facility at 1729 Alaskan Way South be left in its present location.  If it is deemed necessary to take over the MITAGS property, I would hope that the DHS and Coast Guard would recognize the critical nature of the MITAGS facility and operation and step-up with generous support to relocate and reestablish the MITAGS operations.
Thank you for considering this input.  I am happy to discuss these issues if it would be helpful.

Sincerely,
Capt. Blair Bouma

As a medical director of a large maritime operator it is best practice for me to apply quality assurance and quality improvement measures to all policies and processes that I recommend for implementation.

For example: Through the USCG medical credentialing process, a mariner (master) is cleared with coronary artery disease and low exercise tolerance and poor recovery time (was able to walk only 4 minutes on standard bruce protocol stress test--he was issued a waiver and a clearance from his treating cardiologist.  Six months after USCG clearance he is found unresponsive in the wheelhouse as the vessel is underway. The mariner died of a myocardial infarction. How does the USCG approach such a case?  Are the same USCG agents that issued the waiver formally informed of these cases?  And if so, is there a process to review the actions taken critically?

In my practice we handle such cases with a thorough review of all factual events.  In the event of a significant medical event, we review the mariner's entire medical history up to and leading to that significant event.  Doing so makes us better and helps us learn what standards and guidelines are most appropriate for determining authentic medical and physical fitness (for the purpose of maritime safety).  Of course some medical events will not have a precursor or precursors that would have clued in an examiner to take preventive measures (including exclusion from service), but unless a procedure exists to legitimately measure outcomes then any process of credentialing medical and physical fitness is dangerous and haphazard at best.

It is a responsible method to ensure not only the safety of the graduating class and teachers and staff but also the citizens of the state that use the waterways being used on that day. Being outside in open areas, can also reduce the risk of spreading Covid-19 and being outside can create more opportunity to social distance. In addition, being able to gain control of the waterway areas will be a bonus on safety measures and precautions for the students. The Coast Guard will be able to gatekeep any individuals coming into contact, in case anything wre to happen. Also, for the citizens who use the area in the waterways, they will have ample amount of time to take necessary precautions to avoid the area during the time frame given. I feel like this is a proposed rule that should be passed because at the end of the day, the graduation boat parade will occur regardless if the area is closed off to the citzens or not. Gaining control of that area for a couple hours will maximize the security of the event. ",,,,,,,

Second, I have never been to the Lake of the Ozarks but I have seen the popular Netflix documentary starring Jason Bateman.  Based on the show, I assume the area is terribly exciting with a twinge of melancholy.  Interestingly, much of that show is filmed here in Georgia, on Lakes Allatoona and Lanier.  I recommend you visit both lakes sometime following the concert.

Finally, I think the Coast Guard should go ahead and greenlight this rule to allow boat enthusiasts to enjoy live music on the 26th.",,,,,,,

The wastes collected are then to be properly contained and stored in appropriate disposal facilities on land, awaiting eventual breakdown into harmless byproducts that will render them less dangerous.  They are NOT intended to be dumped at sea, thus polluting the world's oceans with hydrogen sulfide and other deadly chemicals.  To have cruise ships ""scrubbing"" their smokestacks is an environmentally sound principal, but NOT if the wastes are then to be dumped into the oceans.  That trades air pollution for water pollution, and is even worse for the environment than letting the toxic gases from fuel consumption go up into the air, then wash down into the sea with the rain.  Through that process, they are at least diluted by distance as the ships and air masses travel at high speeds across the water.  To scrub the stacks and dump the wastes in a concentrated slug will poison the water where they are dumped, either killing outright the ocean's plankton, krill, finfish, shellfish, corals, and other biota, or producing deadly local acid waters.  This must NOT be allowed.  If the scrubbing is to occur, the wastes must be cleaned out in port, and then properly disposed of and destroyed in an ecologically sound manner.",,,,,,,

This is subterfuge and simply transfers their pollutants from the air to the sea.  This must stop!  The world's oceans are contaminated by many pollutants, and this source needs to be shut off and the cruise industry brought into line with their public commitments.

The Coast Guard has a huge fleet, so making such changes will have a large positive impact on the climate and the waters that the Coast Guard should be protecting. 

Importantly, exhaust gas cleaning systems (commonly known as scrubbers) should not be the solution to ships' pollution and climate change. Scrubbers are often heralded as the solution by those who only superficially want to be seen as being environmentally friendly; in fact, scrubbers are at best a ""Band-aid"" fix to mask the problem. Specifically, the cruise ship industry's support of scrubbers is spreading misinformation; CLIA cites a study on scrubbers that the cruise industry funded (obvious conflict of interest!), and the results are opposed to many proper studies in the scientific community. Ships use scrubbers to avoid using more expensive low-sulfur fuels, and the majority of scrubbers are an open-loop variety (the cheapest to install and use). The open-loop scrubbers dump contaminated washwater overboard, harming ecosystems and wildlife. 

The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said in a recent report that drastic actions are needed now to avert catastrophic global consequences. Now is not the time for half-effort and empty gestures. I urge the Coast Guard to be a leader in the field to protect against water and air pollution and ultimately halt the polluting factors that are increasing climate change.

Please know that Scrubbers have no place in programs, policies or regulations to address climate change. 
85% of scrubbers – the mechanism that “cleans” sulfur out of ship exhaust plumes so operators can keep burning one of the dirtiest fossil fuels on earth – are open-loop systems. Meaning, they continuously dump toxic, acidic wastewater straight into the ocean.
More ports around the world are banning ships from using a fuel cleaning system that pumps waste water into the sea, one of the cheapest options for meeting new environmental shipping rules.
Scrubbers aren’t a “green” solution at all. They dump acidic, hot wastewater full of carcinogens, endocrine-disrupting chemicals, and heavy metals into the ocean – and these contaminants don’t just disappear. They accumulate in the blubber of endangered species like orcas and belugas and concentrate up the food web – including into the seafood we put in our stomachs.
The Coast Guard is a huge fleet, and stepping away from dirty fuel and scrubbers, towards a zero-emissions future will have a huge positive impact on the climate and the waters you are tasked to protect. 
Thank you!

Scrubbers have no place in programs, regulation, and policies addressing climate change. Scrubbers collect polluting chemicals and keep them from going into the air, but those chemicals are then placed elsewhere. In the case of cruise ships, they inject them into the ocean, polluting the ocean with extraneous exhaust and toxin-laden wastewater. This affects the health of the ocean waters themselves, ocean life, and the ocean ecosystem, and what the fish injest gets into our bodies as well when we eat fish from these waters.

Many have deliberately dumped oil and garbage into the oceans, only stopping once they get caught. Yet cruise lines are often the first to talk about their commitment to sustainability. With the push to decarbonize the shipping sector, ""zero emissions"" has become the conversation of choice. It would be hard to find a cruise line not currently boasting about their future zero emissions ships or net-zero emissions goals. Adding to the irony, though, is that the vast majority of these cruise lines are using scrubbers to comply with the IMO’s sulfur cap. 

An ICCT study found that scrubbers are not as effective as low-sulfur fuels: Particulate matter emissions were found to be almost 70% higher with scrubbers compared to low-sulfur fuel. For black carbon emissions, there was an 81% increase associated with the use of scrubbers over the use of low sulfur fuel. Yet, the cruise lines are marketing scrubbers to make it seem as if they are the key to success in decarbonization. Carnival Corporation markets their scrubbers as “Advanced Air Quality Systems” and Royal Caribbean uses the term “Advanced Emission Purification” in reference to their scrubbers. Norwegian Cruise Line went so far as to make scrubbers a part of their Eco-Smart Cruising program. These companies put in a lot of effort to make scrubbers seem good for the environment. 

Regardless of what cruise lines' marketing teams may try to say, the bottom line is that scrubbers have no place in programs, regulations, or policies for addressing climate change.",,,,,,,

The cruise industry’s comment and misinformation cannot be left unchecked. We can turn the wave around on the industry by standing up to its pro-fossil fuel rhetoric.
The Coast Guard is a huge fleet, and if you will step away from dirty fuel and scrubbers, towards a zero-emissions future it will  have a huge positive impact on the climate and the waters you are tasked to protect.

Surface seawater is 30 percent more acidic than pre-industrial times and may be another 120 percent by the turn of the century. Permitting scrubbers to discharge acidic wash water is both ironic and alarming.
HFO exhaust gases contain sulfur and nitrogen oxides which form strong acids when mixed with wash water are potentially 100,000 times more acidic than seawater alone. 
Acidic environments make it difficult to calcify skeletons and shells. Acidic conditions also effect fish who expend extra energy to regulate their own pH in their bodies, just as humans do. In turn, marine mammals and people may face diminishing supplies of wildlife. Acidic conditions also release toxic metals normally bound to sediment which means they likely enter into the food supply. Strong acids also reduce the ocean’s ability to regulate the carbon cycle. In addition, open-loop scrubbers conflict with the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea.

Please prioritize our livelihoods and our environment over cheap fuels, environmental catastrophe, and profit and greed.

Protect the oceans and demand the shipping industries no longer empty these wastes anywhere but ashore to be treated, and that such facilities exist to treat them to harmlessness, or require they change the fuels they use to less, or non-, toxic substances that can be treated to harmlessness ashore.

Isn't it enough that they pollute our precious oceans in so many other ways? 

According to the EPA, in a single day of travel from Vancouver to Alaska, a cruise ship emits as much sulfur dioxide as is released daily by 13.1 million cars, and as much soot as 1.06 million cars.
A 3,000-passenger cruise ship (considered an average size, some carry 5,000 or more passengers) generates the following amounts of waste on a typical one-week voyage: 
•	1 million gallons of ""gray water"" 
•	210,000 gallons of raw sewage 
•	25,000 gallons of oily bilge water 
•	Over 100 gallons of hazardous or toxic waste 
•	50 tons of garbage and solid waste 
•	Diesel exhaust emissions equivalent to thousands of automobiles 

Please do not allow this additional pollution into our oceans.

In its own comment to the Coast Guard, CLIA used a biased industry-funded study on scrubbers. Unsurprisingly that study's conclusions further and benefit the cruise industry’s status quo and do not align with the general community of scientists.  This multi-million dollar industry is lying.
The Coast Guard is a huge fleet, and having them step away from dirty fuel and scrubbers, towards a zero-emissions future will have a huge positive impact on the climate and the waters they are tasked to protect. Imagine stopping ocean acidification from vessels, or shutting off the taps on the world’s dirtiest fuels.",,,,,,,

If the Coast Guard is serious about addressing climate change and saving the environment, then it must not allow scrubbing of heavy fuel oil into the ocean or any other water.

I am particularly delighted that the Coast Guard is considering questions related to environmental justice.

There is no doubt among credible scientists that climate change is real and that it is caused by human activity. In August, the IPCC released a new report making it clear that human activity has led to ""Code Red"" climate danger. The window of time to address climate change in a meaningful way is slamming shut, and we have to take significant, wide-sweeping action now if we want any chance of securing a livable future for ourselves, for our most vulnerable communities, and for future generations.

The Coast Guard should keep this in mind when making decisions related to environmental stewardship.

For example, I believe that the Coast Guard should guide the cruise industry toward a zero-emissions future. Please note: not a net-zero future. A zero-emissions future. This means that the cruise industry should not use fossil fuels, especially not heavy fuel oils, and should not rely on ""scrubbers"" to clean up its mess. Scrubbers, which dump highly acidic wastewater into the ocean, simply turn air pollution into water pollution. If the Coast Guard allows the cruise industry to use scrubbers, the oceans will acidify more rapidly than ever, and the oceans will take on the pollution that would otherwise go into the atmosphere. Simply put, scrubbers are not a solution; they represent an intensification of one problem (ocean acidification) and the transfer of another problem (pollution) to a new locale. 

I urge the Coast Guard to look seriously at the science behind scrubbers. I also urge the Coast Guard to evaluate the source of any studies provided by the cruise industry.",,,,,,,

The air emissions released by the scrubbers is heavily contaminated with particulate matter, black carbon, and carbon dioxide. The effluent is turbid and acidic and the contains nitrates, PAHs, and heavy metals that accumulate in the environment and food web and can negatively affect both water quality and marine life. PAHs and heavy metals have been linked to cancers and reproductive disorders in threatened and endangered marine mammals, including Southern Resident killer whales and beluga whales. 

For the above reasons I believe that the Coast Guard needs to pursue powering its ships using clean energy instead of putting a bandaid on a serious threat to the climate and the environment.",,,,,,,

I am writing to oppose the use of scrubbers in programs and regulations for climate change.  Contrary to cruise ship industry misinformation, scrubbers cause ocean acidification and use greenhouse gas increasing technology.

Scrubbers are not a real solution for treating toxic ship engine exhaust.
Please do not allow this environmentally disastrous plan based on misinformation to become policy! The health of oceans and sea life are too important to be abused by the cruise industry and its patrons.

Thank you for your consideration,

Scrubbing exhaust emissions from dirty fuel is at best a transitional half-measure.

If exhaust scrubbers are going to be permitted, the obvious place to scrub the dirtiest part of the emission is before the fuel is loaded aboard the vessels.

In other words, if we must have exhaust scrubbers, there should be pre-treatment of bunker fuel as well.

Additionally, open ocean vessels (at least those sailing from US ports) should be barred from burning recycled engine oil, which is equally dirty, if not dirtier than bunker fuel.

It is always better to clean up pollution at the earliest possible point in the distribution chain.",,,,,,,

Those are just container ships. This washwater is more acidic and contains polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, particulate matter, nitrates, and heavy metals. It is TOXIC POLLUTION and the USCG is tasked with protecting our water ways from pollution.
1. The cruise ship industry is not a necessary 'NEED'(unlike container ships)and has no excuse to use this technology and should be forced to use better fuels.
2. As an organization with the law behind it the USCG needs to step up and push for regulations on scrubbers; ban them for cruise ships.
AND 
3. enforce the existing regulations , until we see the ban. 

I lived on the Pacific ocean for a good part of my life and always feared being run over by the BIG ships on our ocean cruises, but I also hated seeing them around because I knew I did not want to swim anywhere they were. I know we had to know and follow the laws about 'bilge water', waste discharge and the like and would be quickly fined if we stepped out of line. We were just a 72foot sailboat with 3-7 people on board being held to the rules , but we followed them.

I am writing to put forth my objection to the proposed use of ""open-loop"" sulfur and carbon ""scrubbers"" which capture carbon (and other ship exhaust pollutants), and then discharge them directly into the ocean, as a potential solution to combat global warming. All this does is shift carbon pollution from the air to the sea. This will directly contribute to ocean acidification, which wreaks havoc on all marine organisms, by making it harder for them to survive. The most salient effect of ocean acidification is that for shelled organisms, they cannot construct their shells (made of calcium carbonate, CaCo3) with any efficiency when the water becomes more acidic. The implications for ecological damage on a global scale become obvious if the oceans become further acidified. It would be better to do nothing at all (i.e. continue to allow carbon emissions to escape via ship smokestacks) than to capture the carbon and inject it directly into the ocean. 

The Cruise Lines Industry Association (CLIA) is proposing to implement this strategy, ""open-loop scrubbing,"" as a solution to the immense carbon load which they emit into the atmosphere. They have submitted an industry funded study to the Coast Guard which touts the virtues of such an approach. I urge the Coast Guard to reject conclusions of a study which is financed by the industry that is causing the problem, as it conclusions are likely biased and inaccurate, and are designed to portray this potential ""solution"" in the most favorable light, likely because this solution burdens the industry with the least cost. Any serious conclusions regarding the benefits and costs associated with scrubbing/ocean injection should only be considered from studies which are conducted by independent researchers, not ones performed by the Cruise Line Industry.

However, either a ""dry"" or ""closed-loop"" method of scrubbing, whereby CO2 and sulfur are captured and then properly disposed of (on land), are far preferential methods for combatting global warming, as the Greenhouse Gases (GHG's) are captured before release into the atmosphere, and are not allowed to be injected into the ocean. These ""closed-loop"" and ""dry"" approaches should be given serious consideration as a regulatory GHG reduction strategy for the shipping and Cruise Lines industries.

One of the biggest drivers of shipping industry GHG emissions is the ubiquitous practice of using Heavy Fuel Oil (i.e. Bunker Oil) as a fuel source. Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO) is dirty and carbon rich, but it is preferred by the shipping and Cruise Line industries because it is cheap. Marine Gas Oil (MGO), which is more refined and much cleaner than Heavy Fuel Oil, emits significantly less carbon when combusted. If shipping were required to use MGO instead of HFO, the carbon burden upon the environment would be reduced substantially. This strategy should be given serious consideration as regulatory and policy approach.

In sum, it is my opinion that the best strategy toward achieving carbon emission reductions in the shipping and Cruise Line industries is to mandate the use of cleaner MGO fuels, and to require the use of Dry and Closed-loop scrubber devices. Please do not allow these industries to be able implement ""Open-loop"" scrubbing technologies as an industry standard ""solution,"" because they just shift the carbon burden from the atmosphere to the ocean, without any meaningful carbon reductions achieved. 

Thank you for allowing me the opportunity to convey my opinions to the Coast Guard as it evaluates its programs, regulations, and policies for addressing Climate Change. 

Respectfully,

   Scrubbing the exhaust and discharging the toxin-laden wastewater directly into the ocean could well be worse than dispersing exhaust into the air and eventually the water.

Ultimately the goal is renewable ship power when that technology is available.

This fossil fuel when burned emits noxious pollutants.  It's long past the time where this should be regulated, but ""scrubbing"" the post-combustion emissions is not the solution.  This is a thinly veiled attempt to trade air pollution for water pollution.  The proposed method of scrubbing would substitute toxic pollution of the oceans by discharging the scrubbed residues directly into the ocean.  This is not a reasonable tradeoff, and the Coast Guard must know this.  

It's time for the industry to move past filthy fuel oil and adopt genuinely pollution-free modes of propulsion.  The Coast Guard should not be endorsing scrubber technology.  ",,,,,,,

I am the Secretary of the Manatee (County) Clean Energy Alliance and in that role, I create a weekly newsletter and read hundreds of articles every week relating to the environment and the climate crisis. It appears to me that the use of scrubbers is just taking the pollution that was spread in the air and now spreads it in the oceans. Cruise lines do everything they can to save money, which is understandable for any industry. But underpaying employees and polluting the environment are not legitimate for any industry. 
We need to create and enforce regulations that mitigate the climate crisis by using cleaner fuel and emitting few pollutants. Scrubbers should not be part of any regulations. 
The life on our planet is in imminent danger from the climate crisis. It's not worth losing clean air and clean water so that cruise line executives can make some more money. Do you think profit is more important than people? The disinformation campaign by the cruise lines is yet another effort by polluters to fool people into thinking that allowing more pollution is good for us. It isn't.

CLIA, the cruise industry's trade association, claims that scrubbers used on cruise ships are a climate solution and that this technology should allow them to continue to burn one of the dirtiest fossil fuels – heavy fuel oil – by ""scrubbing"" the exhaust and discharging the wastewater, which is full of toxins, directly into the ocean. This disinformation campaign was based on an industry-funded study on scrubbers whose conclusions benefit the industry's status quo and do not align with those of the general community of scientists.

The Coast Guard should not accept the cruise industry's arguments about scrubbers as valid science and should require stricter standards concerning greenhouse gas emissions and toxic wastewater discharges.  It should be kept in mind that taking a cruise is an amusement or luxury, not a necessity, and that polluting the atmosphere and oceans for pleasure is something that our planet cannot afford at this point.

As a physician scientist, I call this a skewed narrative. In its own comment to the Coast Guard, CLIA had the outright audacity to use an industry-funded study on scrubbers (whose conclusions further and benefit the industry’s status quo and do not align with the general community of scientists).
By 2021, the world's ships have to spew less sulfur in the air. 

Oceans are thought to be acidifying faster than at any other point during the past 300 million years because they’re absorbing so much carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Surface seawater today is about 30 per cent more acidic than in pre-industrial times, and that may increase by another 120 per cent by the end of the century.

HFO exhaust gases contain sulfur and nitrogen oxides which form strong acids in the presence of water, producing wash water potentially more than 100,000 times more acidic than the seawater it’s discharged into. Considering acid rain was one of the reasons Annex VI was adopted, permitting scrubbers to discharge acidic washwater is both ironic and alarming.

Internationally, open-loop scrubbers conflict with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, Articles 192, 194, 195, and 196, which relate to protection and preservation of the marine environment. Article 195 specifically says that it is the duty of States to not transform one type of pollution into another. So why are scrubber-equipped vessels permitted to transform air pollution into marine pollution? Please ban open-, hybrid, and closed-loop scrubbers.",,,,,,,

This is a very broad topic, but this comment will be limited to power sources, fuels, and pollution control devices for ships - especially large cargo vessels, USCG boats, and cruise ships. The most commonly used fuels are diesel, heavy oil, or bunker fuel for internal combustion engines (ICE). This exhaust spews GHG emissions as well as at least a dozen kinds of toxic co-pollutants including criteria air pollutants which increase mortality and morbidity. In 2018, 8.7 million people suffered premature death due to fossil fuel emissions. ICE can run on fuels that are less carbon intensive and have lower levels of toxic co-pollutants. Examples are ammonia and some biofuels made from waste that have a lower lifecycle GHG intensity than fossil fuels. (However, some kinds of biomass energy, e.g., from woody biomass, have a higher carbon intensity and co-pollutant emissions than fossil fuels.) 
Another option is to replace ICE with hydrogen fuel cells that use electrolytic H2 that is generated with 100% renewable energy. Worldwide, only 1% of H2 production uses renewable-powered electrolysis. H2 can be stored for months, e.g., in pressurized cannisters. Refueling H2 can be done quickly in ports by removing empty cannisters and uploading full cannisters. Another power source is available commercially for boats that are a maximum of about 10 meters in length. This uses electricity from battery cells to power electric motors. This power source is already available for semi cargo trucks and it is likely that significantly larger electric boats will soon available. The lifecycle emissions profile of this power source depends upon the sources of electricity used to charge the battery. The lowest climate impact is achieved by using 100% renewable electricity. Neither H2 fuel cells nor battery electric power plants emit GHGs or toxic co-pollutants. 
Industry has developed smokestack scrubbers for fossil-fuel powered marine engines in the past 20 years. They are rather pricey and not very effective. The highest percent capture of particulate matter is 70%. Much smaller percentages of a few other toxic co-pollutants are captured. However, if these toxins are dumped into the ocean,this harms marine life and diminishes the ability of microalgae and phytoplankton to perform carbon sequestration. One of the greatest hazards from using scrubbers is that it perpetuates use of ICE and fossil fuels. Furthermore, it does not extract GHGs - so there is no attenuation of climate change. A separate technology, smokestack Carbon Capture Sequestration, is not very effective and is also pricey, but it does achieve gross capture of some of the CO2 emissions. Research has not proven that CCS achieves net capture over the lifecycle. That is, it is unknown whether the emissions from powering the CCS equipment plus fugitive GHG emissions from upstream sources are less than the CO2 captured at the smokestack. A problem that has not been addressed for maritime use is how to store the captured CO2. Dumping it into the air or ocean would defeat the purpose of installing the CCS equipment. Large volume containers, perhaps pressurized cannisters, could be used on ships.
Please collaborate with other agencies to facilitate the use of lower-emissions power plants and fuels in ocean-faring vessels. Port modifications may be required to make this transition convenient, fast, and safe.

On behalf of the Washington State Department of Ecology (Ecology), thank you for seeking public input on how the Coast Guard can work to address the climate crisis. As you know, an effective response will require local, state, and federal entities to work together with urgency. 

The State of Washington is already a national leader on bold climate action. Currently, Ecology is working to implement legislation that will lower carbon emissions statewide by 45 percent by 2030 and 95 percent by 2050. We see opportunities to continue collaborating with the Coast Guard to bolster our response to the climate change. Below are three action items in the areas of spill prevention, preparedness planning, and response coordination that would have a benefit in Washington State. 

•Maximize environmental benefits from a transition to clean fuels: Review existing, and adopt new, programs, regulations, policies, and procedures to address changes in vessel fuels to substantially reduce greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental threats.
•Create a national strategy on marine shipping: Convene and support forums to evaluate the cumulative impacts of marine shipping.
•Remove barriers for communities to participate: Increase inclusivity and consideration of environmental justice in the area planning processes.

Additionally, Ecology recommends the Coast Guard:
•Investigate ways to more directly incorporate monitoring and enforcement of sulfur content requirement in Coast Guard Port State Control inspections.  
•Investigate ways to incorporate a review of domestic vessel emissions into the domestic vessel Certificate of Inspection renewal process to better understand the emissions from these vessels and the impact their operations have on climate change.  
•Review existing, and adopt new, programs, regulations, policies, and procedures to ensure Coast Guard vessels meet or exceed the goals of the IMO’s greenhouse gas strategy . 

Further, we encourage the Coast Guard to invest in programs, practices, and technologies that reduce carbon emissions across all of its operations while maintaining mission-critical capability. 

Creating a national strategy on marine shipping 

The Government of Canada launched an initiative in 2017 to study the potential effects of marine shipping on coastal communities and the environment, and to establish a national framework for assessing those effects. This initiative has identified specific stressors to the marine environment caused by shipping. They are now working to determine management actions that could reduce the impacts. We need a similar effort and national framework in the United States. Current processes and tools, such as Ports and Waterways Safety Assessments, lack the scope to consider the full range of potential environmental stressors related to vessel traffic. Ecology recommends the Coast Guard consider policy and funding options to launch a national initiative to assess the cumulative impacts of marine shipping and identify options for reducing stressors.

Additionally, Ecology recommends Coast Guard District and Sector Commanders convene regular forums to discuss cumulative vessel traffic impacts with states, tribes, and stakeholders. This could be done through Harbor Safety Committees, with sufficient support and participation from Coast Guard District and Sector leaders. 

Removing barriers for communities to participate

There are many coastal communities in Washington, and the Pacific Northwest, at risk for impacts to their economic, cultural, and natural resources from spills. Many are also struggling to understand and address resource impacts related to climate change. Many of these communities experience barriers that prevent them from participating in opportunities to address spill risks and climate change. 

Affected groups include tribes with treaty protected fishing rights and ceremonial use of resources, as well as communities of color and low-income communities that rely on access to coastal areas for fishing and shellfish harvesting. Many tribal communities are working to increase their local capacity to respond to spills, but may be not be aware of or see a place for themselves in area planning processes led by the U.S. Coast Guard. Ecology recommends the Coast Guard consult with tribes and other disproportionately impacted communities to understand the barriers preventing tribes and other underrepresented communities from participating in area planning processes and commit to engaging with tribes as individual sovereign governments with concerns and needs that may be different from state and nearby local governments. 

Thank you again for the opportunity to provide comments. We value our longstanding relationship with the Coast Guard and the opportunity to share our perspectives on important issues challenging our shared mission to protect marine resources, the environment, and communities.

Sincerely,
Carlos Clements",,,,,,"https://downloads.regulations.gov/USCG-2021-0233-0602/attachment_1.pdf",

Scrubbers are helpful for keeping toxins from reaching the ambient air, for instance, and those toxins can then be neutralized and disposed of in an environmentally protective way.

Collecting those toxins and dumping them into the ocean, though, seems to sidestep those very important mitigation procedures.  Interaction with salt water might create additional toxins or immediately harm animal or vegetable life in the dump site.  what safeguards will be available to stop this damage?

I suggest a return to the drawing board on this proposal.  Since cruise ships burn bunker oil, essentially tar sands oil, the residual solid pollutants will all be contained in the water in which they are ""treated.""  All this will be dumped into an ocean that will then be polluted in possibly worse ways.

At this time, when planet earth and its human and other species inhabitants are challenged with climate catastrophe after climate catastrophe, the cruise industry must not be allowed to heap further damage upon our climate and our earth.

The cruise industry must be regulated based on actual science and not on an industry funded study. ",,,,,,,

I understand that scrubbers have been suggested by the cruise industry as a cure for the toxic sludge that ocean liners use for fuel.  This is ridiculous.  Part of the proposal is that the toxic scrubber waste is then dumped into the ocean, so what do you suppose that would do to clean anything up?  Nuttin.  

Whomever in the industry suggested this solution has to be a liar or an idiot.  I don't know much about the operations of a cruise ship, but a third grader would see through this plan as stupid as it is.  Of course they paid for a study, conducted by those who knew their benefactor's wishes and wanted to comply.  What is that worth?  Nuttin.  Graft.  

If you want a real, honest, reliable solution to the problem of cruise ship fuel waste, ask the real, honest, and reliable scientists whose business it is to know.  Ask the NIH scientists (not the administration who never know anything about what they are supervising).  

Please scrap this whole concept of scrubbers.  It would be a giant waste of time and money, and the environment.  The oceans are an ecosystem and critical to life on Earth.  When our oceans are in good health, we are in good health, but now they are dying from fossil fuels, from excavation to transportation to use, and are killing us all.  You may have a space ship, but as yet there are no colonies elsewhere.  Some life.  Don't encourage more stupidity and wasteful grandstanding so a few zillionaires can rake in more money to bribe more lackeys who set policies for the entire planet to suffer. Don't do anything you will regret in another few years.

It has been obvious to me since my first earth science college courses almost 50 years ago that the climate crisis was approaching. I have done my best to slow our global speed towards it by education others and continue to try to do so.

 The cruise industry is  trying to legitimize the technology that allows them to continue to burn one of the dirtiest fossil fuels on earth - heavy fuel oil - by ‘scrubbing’ the exhaust and discharging the toxin-laden wastewater directly into the ocean. CLIA is presenting not a climate solution, but prolonging the problem. The ocean is not an inexhaustible depository for our wastes, on the contrary, we have seen its temperature and acidity change slowly and inexorably, with measurable and increasing negative impacts on an ecosystem on which billions of humans depend for food.

The CLIA representation of scrubbers is a dangerous misinformation campaign, and we must make sure scrubbers are known for what they are, and not some miracle technology. Scrubbers have no place in programs, regulations, and policies for addressing climate change. This technology will allow dirty fuel to increase ocean acidification and greenhouse gases.  Like the airline industry, the cruise ship industry must commit now to a rapid, radical move away from fossil fuels.  It can be done, but will only be postponed by technology like this. We have run out of time, as our more frequent and intense weather events show.  The Coast Guard should be abundantly aware of this, of all organizations.
 
The Coast Guard should move its own huge fleet rapidly towards a zero-emissions future to have a huge positive impact on the climate and the waters you are tasked to protect. We can stop ocean acidification from vessels and shutting off the taps on the world’s dirtiest fuels but only by definitive action now. Banning scrubbers is one crucial step in this direction.

We should really start with the cruise industry and work hard to have cruise ships limit the amount of fuels they consume and wastewater that is dumped into the oceans.

It seems to me that we can regulate cruise ships so that they do not pollute as much.
I understand they seem to think that ""scrubber"" technology limits the amount the cruise ships pollute, but I feel we need to have higher, more regulated standards.

Thankyou for doing all that you can do to protect marine environments and limit the amount of pollution that cruise ships dump into the oceans.

However, those 'findings' contradict all the scientific community's conclusions and even common sense. Even if one were to believe the by-product of exhaust 'scrubbers' were harmless (which of course they absolutely are not), their proposed method of disposal directly back into the ocean, which ostensibly the scrubbers are helping to protect, entirely defeats their purpose. 

The entire proposition is ludicrous and as such, I am emphatically speaking out against either the use of scrubbers and the proposed manner of disposal of their byproducts. Our entire climate, planet & species' survival and future is dependent on the health of our oceans. To consider allowing such destructive & exploitive practices to be allowed for the convenience & profit of not just cruise lines but all industries who employ large ships (yours included) is pure folly.

The CLIA study has no basis being used in an informed decision making process. 
 Heavy metals and PAHs are just some of the toxins found in scrubber wash water that are routinely dumped into an increasingly acidified, over cocci fied marine ecosystem and have been linked to the declining health in marine mammal spirit ecies, including some under the near time threat of extinction. 
 Scrubber discharges have already been banned in California, Hawaii, and Connecticut, as well as Norway, China, Singapore, Belgium and the united Arab emirates. 
  It is imperative that we address these ongoing pollution concerns by banning all discharges of exhaust gas scrubber wash water created by one of the largest industrial sources. Caring for the marine environment we all depend on by banning these for profit pollution dumping practices is an important step in regenerating the sorely needed life-sustaining qualities necessary for the continued survival of organized human existence on the planet.

Scrubbers will not reduce the demand for dirty fuel, but they will increase water-borne pollution, ocean acidification and greenhouse gas emissions.

Moreover, the Coast Guard should not rely on a study on scrubbers funded by Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA), the cruise industry’s trade association. Such a study is likely to be biased in favor of cruise lines and against meaningful, long-term (yet expensive) solutions that would actually reduce emissions and pollution. In fact, the study's conclusions do not align with those of the general community of scientists, but not surprisingly they do benefit CLIA members by furthering the industry’s status quo, rendering the study little more than a greenwashing misinformation campaign.

Please do not validate the CLIA scrubber study. Scrubbers are not a viable long-term solution. Money spent by the cruise line industry (and shipping industry in general) should be directed to effective long-term solutions that significantly reduce demand for fossil fuels (the dirtiest of which are used by the shipping industry) and achieve zero emission of greenhouse gases.

Subject: Protect the Oceans and the Atmosphere -- Request for Information on Coast Guard Programs, Regulations, and Policies for Addressing Climate Change (Document ID: USCG-2021-0233-0001)

To US Coast Guard Assistant Commandant for Prevention Policy Rear Admiral J.W. Mauger:

I strongly urge the US Coast Guard to address climate change, in part, by moving away from fueling its fleet with fossil fuels and to instead power its vessels using truly renewable energy (e.g., not nuclear nor ""alternative fuels such as LNG, bio-LNG or synthetic LNG, Methanol""). Exhaust Gas Cleaning Systems (EGCS) may help reduce greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere, but this so-called ""climate change-friendly technolog[y]"" produces a stew of toxic wastewater that is then dumped into the already overly-polluted ocean. Please adopt technology that will not further pollute the atmosphere or the ocean.

Thank you for your consideration of my comments. Please do NOT add my name to your mailing list. I will learn about future developments on this issue from other sources.

Sincerely,
Christopher Lish

However, we are a highly used recreation area and the influx of visitors continues to grow every summer while their ability to make smart decisions tends to dwindle. I hope you reconsider keeping this one open as Duluth is over 2 hours away if personnel were to first tow a boat up the shore and the likely hood of getting here in two hours could turn into 3 or 4 if the traffic is heavy. If the emergency is happening in Grand Portage, MN then the response time would probably be 5 or 6 hours.  By air or by waterway, not as bad of course but what happens when a smaller boat is needed though?  I do have family that have been in the USCG Auxilliary and there are a few in the Grand Marais marina still but they also have other jobs and are not available 24/7.

It is very hard for me to believe that the boaters of Holland will be kept safe using the Grand Haven Coast Guard. I do not even own a boat but I live in Holland close to the water. I frequently observe the Holland Coast Guard boats out checking on the boaters out on the water. I have watched them aid in rescues. I think this is opening up the door to more and more boaters to break the rules and know that they are going to get away with it because who is going to stop them. 

I along with my son had been out walking and noticed a man struggling to get from a dingy into his larger boat tied up close to the Holland station. He was about to go under. I hollered to the gentlemen at the station and they were able to quickly jump in their boat and go out and rescue the man. Without them right there this man could very well have drown without this quick help.

 A boat coming from Grand Haven would not have helped this man. I believe there will be many other situations that lives could be lost and more people injured by not having a local Coast Guard. Holland is a very busy beach and boat area. Numerous people have also been rescued by the pier. I cant fathom a boater needing help and having to tell them hold on they just have to come from Grand Haven. I believe lives will be lost with this decision.",,,,,,,

Lake Michigan is the most dangerous lake for drownings in the entire USA (per: thetravel.com).  The most dangerous beach in Lake Michigan is Holland State Park (per:NWS)  By extrapolation, we have the most dangerous beach in the USA for drownings!  So here we have a perfect opportunity to save lives- a Coast Guard rescue station right there!  I cannot understand why we would choose to close such a crucial rescue location.  Holland State Park is also one of the busiest beaches in Michigan,  The lake Macatawa area is also becoming more popular with boaters as more dock slips are being built.  I suspect that attempting to execute a rescue from Grand Haven to Holland is far more costly and with a far slower response and a poor success rate.  Shouldn't the goal here be to maximize the potential to save lives?  I would venture to guess that the savings for closing this facility will largely be offset by the increased cost to mount a full on rescue operation from Grand Haven to Holland State Park.  These drownings and near drownings happen regularly at Holland State Park. Lets put lives before dollars.  Please, do not close this facility.  ",,,,,,,

I believe this decision should be reversed with the Station continuing to operate on a summer schedule.

As noted in an article in the Holland Sentinel (July 2, 2021), the Station has operated in Holland since 1885. Although we have not been around for quite that long, we have lived across the street from the Station since 1975. The facility is well maintained and the men and women of the Coast Guard courteous and professional. We have observed the operations and have seen many situations where their quick response and well trained staff have prevented property loss and saved lives, not to mention preventing general mayhem on Lake Macatawa. Most recently, over the July 4th weekend, we made it a point to watch a little more closely. One situation on July 4 sent the Coast Guard east on Lake Macatawa to answer a call. They were prepared and ready to help. Being only minutes from any point of Lake Macatawa was essential to the response. On the following day, the Coast Guard operated a patrol boat in front of the Coast Guard Station enforcing the ‘no wake zone’ and helping to insure boater safety.

The stated reason for closing the station is to consolidate operations at the Grand Haven facility, as the Coast Guard boats are now faster and more capable with better location technology and supported with helicopters. We acknowledge this would adequately serve boaters on Lake Michigan. However, it is not possible to serve boaters on Lake Macatawa in a timely fashion from the Grand Haven station. Logistically, it is not possible to get through the Holland channel to Lake Macatawa from Grand Haven as fast as being already on Lake Macatawa. We can attest to the volume of boat traffic on Lake Mac, as anyone who was there over the weekend can verify. Incidents can occur at any time given this amount of traffic, and it is very important that the Coast Guard and the Ottawa County Sheriff’s be available to help and enforce safe boating practices.

We believe closing the Holland Coast Guard Station would reduce the safety on a very crowded waterway. We ask that this decision be reconsidered.

As a boater, and former Coastie, I see the Holland, MI Station (seasonal as it may be...) as a water safety resource for an area of coverage, that can not be so easily managed by patrols launching from Grand Haven. In the past eight years, there have been 733 Great Lakes drownings. Before this year, 2012 and 2016 were tied for the most drownings, with 99 each. Historically, Lake Michigan is home to nearly half of all the drowning deaths across the five Great Lakes.

As A firefighter I I hear these calls on the radio quite frequently. Many times the Coast guard is unavailable or extended response times for rescue in the Holland area of operations And is further extended to ports that are south of Holland.

 I feel that the elimination of this Coast guard station is going to severely hamper the local outreach.


The amount of paddle craft that are on lake macatawa and in saugatuck on a weekend is very high. There will be limited to zero education for these, many times novice navigators.


Closing the station permanently is going to have lasting effects, it's going to remove many years of History and memories for many active duty and auxiliary members. It's going to decrease safety and security on our local waterways. It will hamper response times and will likely increase chance of death by the boating public.


As boat ownership and high-risk vessel such as canoes and kayaks continue to increase the elimination of this station is going to further drive the increase in boating incidents and fatalities that have already increased dramatically in the last few years.

Even without considering the boating traffic heavy during the summer, consistent traffic with fisherman in the winter, take into consideration that the neighboring town of Deltaville is officially the boating capital of the Chesapeake Bay and only second to Annapolis. Please consider these points:
·       The US Coast Guard presence on the water instills a sense of law enforcement, safety, and peace of mind to the boating community.

·       Currently in Station Milford Havens Area of Responsibility (AOR) there are more than 3500 miles of shoreline which includes The Northern AOR from Smith Point to Windmill Point; The Southern AOR - the York River and Mobjack Bay; The Western AOR - the Piankatank and the Rappahannock Rivers and all main tributaries up to Fredericksburg and out to Lake Anna; and The Eastern AOR across the Bay from Occohannock to Nandua Creek. 

·       One of the Coast Guard primary missions is to promote boating safety, prosecuting boating under the influence (BUI's) and any unsafe boating practices.

·       USCG protects local commerce.

·       The Northern Neck and Middle Peninsula continue with recreational and commercial fishing throughout winter months when water temperatures are deadly. Response times from the closest Coast Guard base in Portsmouth to mishaps would be dismal. A person falling in the water, boat failures and sudden weather changes have the potential for increased fatalities (ie Rock Fishing through December).

·       Even though the primary responsibility is under the state Department of Wildlife Resources (DWR) and Virginia Marine Resources (VMRC), the Coast Guard protects the bay from drug activity, pollution, overfishing, crabbing, and oysters.  One is less apt to break the law knowing the Coast Guard is on the water.

·       Travel and response times as pointed out above from Portsmouth not just to SMH under ideal weather conditions, could be as long as 2 hours. But consider traveling up the Rappahannock River or further up the peninsulas as far as Reedville, the mouth of the Potomac and other areas of responsibility such as across the bay to the Eastern shore are now assigned to Station Milford Haven.  Mishaps typically occur when there are NOT ideal weather conditions.

·       USCG Station Milford Haven regularly participates with traffic and safety control for boat races, regattas, fireworks and numerous on the water activities

·       USCG Station Milford Haven has responded to countless Search and Rescue saving lives and protecting millions of dollars in property for our community. They have been an invaluable asset and their loss would be disastrous.",,,,,,,

However, responding in a 29 from Grand haven to Saugatuck in anything over 1-2's is no better than a 47. Scrambling a 65 from Muskegon (seasonally staffed) is not the answer for everything either.

Also, Coast Guard Response Crews will be put at risk. Fatigue limits for crews will be routinely exceeded and most likely be cause for additional units to respond and thereby jeopardize more people.

I am greatly concerned about the impact on boater safety that would occur with only seasonal operation. I fish the Chesapeake from May through December 31st when rockfish season closes. The best fishing for rockfish is December when the water is cold. There are often hundreds of recreational vessels on the Bay within 5-10 miles of Station Milford Haven. The presence of the station gives me sufficient comfort to venture out on the cold water where life expectancy in the water is measured in minutes due to rapid hypothermia. Please reconsider the downgrade of this important station. 
I have immense respect for the men and women of the Coast Guard. In fact, a friend and I were rescued by Station Milford Haven 25+ years ago when our sailboat sank. (I'll try to find an old photo and send to you!)

I am asking that the Coast Guard reconsider for the following reasons:
•	To show the enormity of the boating community In the area within 5 miles of the Coast Guard Station there are :
o	Over 250 boats stored at a marina for immediate use of their owners and are next door to Station Milford Haven.  
o	Queens Creek Marina, a mile away  has over 35 slips occupied by both power and sail boats and a visual count of  boats along Queens Creek reveals more than 60 boats 
o	Stingray point and Fishing Bay, 2 marinas in Deltaville, are rated in the top 10 Marinas in Virginia- by Boat Smart, an approved boating safety education institution.  These marinas along with a multitude of others are home to several hundred boats, both power and sail.
In the Northern Neck and Middle Peninsula of Virginia, boaters continue with recreational and commercial fishing throughout winter months when water temperatures are deadly. Response times from the nearest Coast Guard base such as Portsmouth, almost 40 miles by water and 70 by land, to mishaps are unacceptable.  Under ideal weather conditions it could be as long as 2 hours.  A person falling in the water, boat failures and sudden weather changes have the potential for increased fatalities.

While it does NOT appear to have been directly addressed in this docket, information from other official USCG sources indicates that certain Stations which are currently manned on a year round basis will reduced to ""Seasonal"" status of an undefined nature. My comments here are relative to the Boat Station at Milford Haven, Virginia.

Milford Haven is responsible for an area of coastal Virginia that can best be described as remote. Movement by road is difficult because there are several water barriers to quick transportation. There is a substantial and growing population with recreational boating interests, some of which are year round, based on Virginia's temperate climate. In addition, there is a substantial commercial fishery, both in terms of large vessels and small one or two man boats. The commercial activities are conducted on a year round basis. All of these interests depend on Milford Haven to ensure their safety and quick response in the event of a marine accident of some type. Milford Haven is also responsible for the care and maintenance of the large number of aids to navigation in the area, both public aids and the supervision of a hosts of approved private aids to navigation. I myself reside in a creek directly off the Great Wicomico River and use these aids on a daily basis. I also depend on Milford Haven for the possibility of quick response in the event of a marine accident of some sort.....the emphasis here being on Public Safety.

I respectfully request that the Coast Guard reconsider the reclassification of Milford Haven from full time to seasonal. The safety of the Maritime Public requires the continuation of the station.

Though it may seem unimportant to Big Government, the station is very important to our local community. Yes, it is busier in the months of April through September, however, we have people on our waters year round and emergencies are not seasonal. Our community uses these waters to make a living and if there is an emergency the difference between aid coming from Cape Charles and Hudgins could mean life or death to one of our own. What this station does for our community is immensely important. These men and women are also a very important part of our community. They have become valuable in other ways on and off our waters. Their children are part of our school system and are involved with friends and activities, as well as their parents.
It may be a small station but it is an important one. Please reconsider downsizing it.
I am also very proud of our grandson who is presently in the Coast Guard, Stationed on Belle Island, Michigan.

This is not the case.  
It is approximately 20 miles pierhead to pierhead, from Grand Haven to Holland.  IF the CG has a boat capable of 60 Knots it would take nearly 20 minutes to travel that distance, even with ideal water conditions.  If there would be a man-overboard, vessel fire, or vessel collision, the possibility of death(s) will be much higher if there is a 20-minute delay for help to arrive.  I know that there is a helicopter in this area, but it would be of no use in the event of a vessel fire.

We were very happy they arrived so fast. We know that anything can happen on Lake Michigan and feel safe knowing they are there to help.

Now, that the Holland area has doubled it's boating activity, we feel the need more than ever to have a coast guard presence in Holland.  We see so much stupid activity just in Lake Macatawa alone by boaters that don't know the rules of safe boating.  

The Holland unit is there to assist the Saugatuck port as well.

Two key reasons influence my position:

1. Please note that the Station services one of the busiest channels on all of Lake Michigan, and serves two of the top five most visited State Parks in the Michigan - Holland and Saugatuck. Tourism funds in these communities plays a significant role in the local economy. The Coast Guard station provides critical support to support these economies. 

2. With the influx of tourists, local and regional visitors to these waters, there is significant safety concerns that the Coast Guard currently addresses. In 2020, drownings in Lake Michigan were at a 10-year high. Typically, tourists are not familiar with the riptides and risks of Lake Michigan currents, piers and other safety cautions. The Coast Guard is a much-needed resource for the safety of everyone visiting this natural resource. 

Numerous research studies point to the benefits of people spending time in nature; and many government and non-government organizations are promoting the value of spending time outdoors. We must have resources to protect people who choose to do so.

•	My primary concern is procedural - the Federal Register/Vol. 86, No. 109/ Wednesday, June 9, 2021/Notice” is recognized as addressing small USCG closures only.  However, downsizing or making a station seasonal can be as impactful to the public and waterway safety as a closure.  In the absence of a formal FR Notice, how is the public supposed to be alerted to the proposed downsizing a local Station or making it seasonal?  In the absence of formal notice, where is one to submit comment assuming one becomes aware of proposed action.
•	The study identified in the FR Notice as the basis for determination of overlapping and unnecessarily duplicative coverage by USCG stations was issued in October 2017.  The graphic in the highlights of that study indicate that the observations were done in May 2017.  I question the utility of those data about Station Milford Haven (SMH) for two reasons:

o	The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the recreational boating profile significantly with the dramatic rise in boat purchases during a time that safe boating courses were unavailable or only online.  Specifically, there has been a surge of recreational boaters and a significant number of them are inexperienced and have had very limited effective safe boating training.  With no experience and no opportunity for in-person safe boating classes, which are surely more effective than online coursework, it is not surprising that mortalities due to boating incidents have spiked.

o	The GAO Highlights of that study, GAO-18-9, points out that the Coast Guard has a 2-hour search and rescue (SAR) standard that was applied in the study issued in October 2017.  It is my understanding that the proposal is to make SMH seasonal in 2022 with no winter operations.  Specifically, it is my understanding that SMH is being proposed remain operational (as it is today) until it would close in November 2022 with the plan to reopen in May of 2023.  Winter conditions in the Chesapeake Bay and its associated rivers and creeks present serious hypothermia conditions; a 2-hour SAR standard is grossly inappropriate.  Review of the timing of onset of serious hypothermia effects in cold waters clearly makes a 2-hour response in the winter inadequate.
•	I suspect the Coast Guard Office of Boat Forces has accurate data about the number of SAR missions handled by SMH during the past two winter seasons (November to May).  While the number of winter SARs is an interesting metric, the more important numbers are persons rescued and property saved; one charter boat, cruise ship, menhaden boat rescued may be the more appropriate metric considering the year-round traffic in the Bay.  One large vessel, like the Cuyahoga sinking in 1978 (11 of 29 lost) quickly puts the need for quick response time during the winter into perspective.
•	How fast Portsmouth can be on scene to an incident in the winter is of significant concern.  Travel time by boat or by land given tunnel access, weather conditions, or traffic raises concern in the face of cold-water conditions and the short time for hypothermia to be life threatening.
•	Duck hunting is a winter sport that is popular in our area, and they get out in camouflaged small boats or use small boats to get out to duck blinds.  Here in Wicomico Church, we nearly lost a hunter and his dog when he capsized near Mill Creek.  He was spotted by a neighbor and saved by another neighbor who went out on his personal boat with his son.  Smith Point Rescue arrived quickly, but critical minutes after the delivery of the hunter to shore and a waiting ambulance.  I was told that his core temperature was so low the paramedic’s equipment could not read a temperature; but they saved him and his dog – basically a miracle.  Response time is critical!
•	Knowing that the USCG Auxiliary uses privately owned boats to support the USCG, such support during the winter months would be very questionable as many pull their boats out of the water in the winter for safe storage or maintenance/repair.  In our immediate area, the Auxiliary unit is not prepared or equipped to respond to a SAR call in the winter as they are not certified to wear the required dry suits to go out when water temperatures are below 50 F. 
•	The Virginia commercial fishery for menhaden is the largest on the Atlantic Coast.  Most menhaden are landed by purse seine vessels, owned by Omega Protein, which operates out of Reedville, VA, with convenient access to the Chesapeake Bay.  To my knowledge, that is a year-round operation.  Other commercial vessels that routinely travel the Bay between the Potomac River and the York River include tankers, cargo ships, tugs, and other working boats and barges, cruise ships, watermen, etc.…. the area of responsibility for SMH is large and year-round.

One of the stated explanations was there has been “…. an overall reduction in rescue calls...”. Maybe this is true for some of the other stations under consideration, but certainly not the Scituate, MA location. We have seen an increase of 20+% in rescue calls over the past 2 years. In addition, there have been 2 water related deaths in 2021, as well as many rescues.
Scituate Harbor and North River in Scituate Ma is home to approx. 2,000 Moorings and Slips, as well as many day boaters launching boats from trailers on multiple ramps. The neighboring towns have several hundred boaters operating out of their waters. In addition, we have a thriving commercial fleet- according to the Massachusetts DMF, Scituate is a top 5 port by Ex-Vessel Value for Groundfish in 2018. Finally, the North River inlet is regarded as one of the most treacherous inlets on the Massachusetts Coast- there have been many Coast Guard SAR’s over the past decade in those waters. I am baffled as to why anyone would believe that it is a good idea to close the Scituate Station- unless this is a financial decision, where dollars count more than protecting lives. Has the Coast Guard fallen to that level?
We have established a deep working relationship with Sector Boston, and greatly appreciate the work done at the Scituate Coast Guard Station. The joint working relationship between the Harbormaster, SPD, SFD and the Coast Guard functions exceedingly well; and I am greatly confused as to why you would want to create a dangerous environment by considering to close the Scituate station.
As you know, the motto of the United States Coast Guard is Semper Paratus- “always ready”. There is no way removing the Scituate MA Station lives up to that motto- please follow your motto and be ready to protect lives and the health, safety and welfare of our tax paying residents.

I am writing to you in regards to station Scituate Ma. I ask that you seriously reconsider consolidating this station. This year alone we have seen multiple incidents in the Scituate areas including loss of life. The Coast guard has held a major role in response to incidents including station Scituate. While I understand the concept of consolidation, this would be a mistake for station Scituate. The Scituate harbor area is somewhat isolated and the next small boat station is at least a 20-30 minute response, and I believe that is a generous timeline. Having station Scituate in a heavily boated area with a difficult harbor to enter/exit with a constant swell near a dangerous jetty along with the notorious North River not far from the harbor is a essential asset to the community for safety and support. Please reconsider this logistical decision and keep station Scituate. Thank you for your time.  ",,,,,,,

I am responding to your proposal to close the Coast Guard station in Grand Marais, MN.  I have been a resident of this community for the majority of my life.  My husband and I are avid users of Lake Superior for fishing from May thru September as the weather allows.  We also have family who come from 5 hours away to fish on several occasions in the summer.  The presence of the Coast Guard has always been a factor of me feeling safer and enjoying my lake experience.  Knowing that while we have GPS tracking and cell phones, as well as the equipment needed to signal for help if needed, things can quickly go bad and I am grateful for the USCG presence in our area.  
Grand Marais has grown exponentially in tourism over the last ten years.  The number of recreational users has grown, not only in fishing craft, but with kayaks, paddleboards and those choosing to jump in and swim from our lighthouse breakwall.  With an increase of users, can come an increase of accidents and if the station closes, assistance is at least two hours away.  I am sure I do not have to explain that loss of life is almost sure to happen with a wait so long.  
We have appreciated not only the presence of the USCG, but most seasons we are usually visited by the crew on the lake as they check that we are in compliance with the rules and following safety protocols.  It certainly keeps all of us honest and makes sure we have the best chance for a good outcome in the event of an issue where help could be needed.
Nineteen years ago, one of my closest friends lost his brother to Lake Superior.  He and another man went out kayaking on a rough September day and both were overturned.  Because the Coast Guard was not here at the time, a local commercial fisherman risked his own safety when he heard help was needed.  He was able to reach one of the men and get him in the boat, but hypothermia had set in and he did not survive.  My friend's brother was found the following morning several miles east of Grand Marais deceased, but afloat due to his PFD.  I was glad his family never had to live knowing their son/brother was lost in the lake never to be recovered.  While this has been many years, I remember well the pain of a family losing a loved one.  I don't wish this to happen to others.
I greatly hope you will reconsider your intent to close this station.  As money tightens, hard choices are made, but I feel leaving so much of the North Shore of Lake Superior without a USCG presence would be a grave error and would be disappointed if this were to happen.  Thank you for your time and consideration in this matter.",,,,,,,

Comment Regarding Consolidation of Redundant Coast Guard Boat Stations

To whom it may concern,

On June 9, 2021, the U.S. Coast Guard announced that the Coast Guard facility in Grand Marais, is on a list of Great Lakes stations that will be consolidated, meaning that there will be no Coast Guard presence on the Grand Marais waterfront.

The Grand Marais City Council Urges U.S. Coast Guard to reconsider their decision to vacate the Grand Marais coast guard station. 

The Coast Guard explained that based on an average of less than one case per year over the last 10 years the Grand Marais Station is no longer necessary.

The Council questions the reliability of the information being used to make the case for withdrawal of the Grand Marais Guard Station.

Based on the Cook County Sheriff's records of 23 Water Emergencies on Lake Superior 2018 - 2021, The Council Feels that there is a substantial need for a Coast Guard presence. Local agencies are not equipped to provide an adequate response quickly enough in emergencies likely leading to an increase in preventable loss of life. 

The presence of the Coast Guard inspecting local boaters and ensuring compliance of laws governing Lake Superior boating decreases the need for emergency response. Ideally, all users of Lake Superior would follow the rules knowing they are there for the safety of vessels on the lake. But the disappearance of enforcement will likely lead to an increase in non-compliance which will lead to situations where boaters can’t help themselves. 

An increased amount of non-local tourist traffic in the past several years also warrants the continued presence of the Coast Guard as those unfamiliar with the dangers and temperament of Lake Superior explore and engage in the lake without the understanding and capacity to deal with mistakes or bad decisions.

Sincerely, the Grand Marais City Council

To be without this station would unnecessarily jeopardize a great number of people - particularly those working the water which may not have the best equipment to deal with emergencies.  Further, there is no logical station nearby to serve the area within an acceptable amount of time - if one were to have an issue during the window in which the station is proposed to close, it would almost certainly mean considerable hardship and most likely death.  Finally, the Coast Guard acts as a stabilizing agent on the water.  Given the boat traffic through the general area of the Middle Peninsula of Virginia (including those times in which the station has proposed to close), the local community very much depends on its leadership to help support safe boating.

As a member of the Town of Scituate Select Board, I have been involved in many emergency response calls within our 21 square miles of waterways, including over seven miles of coastline.  Countless times, the combined resources of our local public safety officials, the Coast Guard, neighboring community resources, and State environmental police have been needed to address crises off our coast. While response times are improving with better technology and equipment, the frequency of need is growing exponentially with harsher conditions resulting from climate change. The reality is we need extremely well trained, well provisioned experts to effectively safeguard not only our waters, but the waters between Boston and the Cape Cod Canal.  Scituate is perfectly located to provide a mid-way point for these efforts.  The Coast Guard is essential to providing the expertise needed. Honestly, this section of sea use would benefit from an expansion in Scituate, rather than elimination.  By moving resources closer to Boston, you are extending the response time to all points south. It frankly makes no sense.  I strongly urge you to reconsider this location and retain a Coast Guard presence in Scituate, Massachusetts.",,,,,,,

I strongly believe the Coast Guard Station should stay as assigned and not be downgraded to a seasonal station.  Our community depends on the services the Coast Guard provides.  A brief glance at a map of our region makes the concerns and dangers self-evident.

Here are my concerns:  

1)If the station is downgraded, it will put in jeopardy all our waterman who work in the fall and winter seasons.  
2)The recent rise in motorboat and watersports equipment sales indicates a greater need for emergency services, not less.  The Nat'l Marine Mnfctrs Assoc. claims sales are at a 13 year high and we are experiencing a boating 'boom'.  Paddle-sports went from 110 million in 2019 to 172 million in 2020.  That is over a 56% increase in paddle-sports equipment sales in ONE year. (Source: Statista: https://www.statista.com/statistics/1181864/paddle-sport-sales/)
3) It will not take drug traffickers long to realize it's easier for them to drop a shipment somewhere up a tidal creek at a pre-arranged location, to be picked up on the water or dropped at a convenient shore.  With the nearest manned station over two hours away by water and many rural areas sparsely policed, it will not take long for our creeks and waterways to become the preferred 'drop spot for traffickers.  
With 7,213 miles of tidal shoreline Milford Haven covers a significant percentage of that.  I believe that, with the constraints of real time travel by water or land from Portsmouth It will delay emergency service during the months when sports fishing is ongoing, and a significant amount of kayaking, canoeing, and paddleboarding is still active due to unusually clement weather.  Many newer boaters and paddlers are not familiar with the shoaling in our waters and can easily become stranded in dangerous conditions.  
There is every possibility that the downgrade of Milford Haven to a seasonal station will result in an increase in danger to our boating, waterfowl hunting, and paddle sports community.

The proposal states:  “This consolidation will result in a more robust response system by increasing staffing levels and capacity at select nearby boat stations. Such a consolidation creates synergy and more opportunities for boat operators to properly train instead of missing training opportunities while standing ready to respond to calls that do not come.”
I understand the seasonal Coast Guard station in Scituate Massachusetts is one of the stations being considered for consolidation/closure.  If this station is closed the nearest Coast Guard stations will be Point Allerton in Hull, approximately 12 miles from Scituate station and further away, those in Provincetown, Cape Cod canal and Boston.
I am very concerned about the additional risk this exposes to recreational and commercial boaters and fisherman across Cape Cod Bay.  I am a Scituate MA resident and a local recreational boater for many years.
The notice fails to cite crucial information about:
1.	The remaining median nautical distance between the stations across Cape Cod Bay and the associated response time.  For example, assuming moderate to rough seas, how long will it take a Coast Guard vessel to reach a boater in distress off the coast of Scituate, Marshfield, Duxbury or on Stellwagen Bank, a popular fishing destination.  If a distress call involves a medical emergency, fire or sinking the response time is crucial.
2.	The number of registered recreational and commercial boaters in the area served by the Scituate Coast Guard station.
3.	Where the “nearby boat stations” are and how the staffing level changes are to be effected.
4.	The number of recent rescue calls in these areas.  The Coast Guard 2020 Recreational Boating Statistics [COMMANDANT PUBLICATION P16754.34] (link below) states:  “There is evidence that boating activity rose significantly during the pandemic, from reports of increased boat sales, insurance policies taken out, insurance claims, and calls for towing assistance.  Compared to 2019, the number of accidents increased 26.3%, the number of deaths increased 25.1%, and the number of injuries increased 24.7%.”
5.	The amount of savings expected by closing the seasonal Scituate Coast Guard station.
6.	The note about “boat operators to properly train” does not say how this is to be accomplished and the associated cost.

I urge you to stop this from happening.  We need this Coast Guard Station.  It is a vital asset and integral part of the local safety response teams.

Re: Downgrading Station Milford Haven, Mathews County, VA

Admiral Karl L. Schultz 
Commandant of the Coast Guard 
U.S. Coast Guard
2703 Martin Luther King Jr. Ave. SE Washington, D.C. 20593

Dear Admiral Schultz,

I am the current public school division superintendent serving Mathews County, Virginia.  While considering the impact of the downgrading of Station Milford Haven, VA, I am greatly concerned about two unintended consequences of this action:  public safety and student enrollment in the local school.

The downgrading of Station Milford Haven will have a direct impact on timely lifesaving services of the Coast Guard to the residents and visitors of Mathew County.  As you are aware, a timely response to a capsized vessel is imperative especially during the winter months.  With the downgrading of Station Milford Haven, the response time to a crisis event will be extended when teams must originate from a further location.  From a safety standpoint, this is not acceptable for a community with visitors who utilize the waterways with recreational vessels and working watermen year round.

In addition, the downgrading of Station Milford Haven will directly impact the local school division’s student enrollment.    Mathews County Public Schools has thirty-two military connected families.  This may seem small, however, this is significant for a small rural community like Mathews County.  Approximately one-third of these are directly related to Station Milford Haven.  A reduction in student enrollment will result in a reduction of teacher position in our small community.
 
Please reconsider the downgrade of this important station.
  

Sincerely,


Nancy B. Welch, Ed.S.

I strongly oppose the reduction in capability of Milford Haven Station to seasonal status.  This area of the middle Bay is highly dependent on water-based businesses, both recreational, service, and commercial/food that rely on safe waterways.  It is a high water traffic area with significant percentages of residents living on and/or using the waterways.  Record numbers of individuals have moved to the area in 2020 due to COVID to enjoy the peaceful, safe communities and waterways, and many of these have been part of that boat buying boom.  We need the varied and necessary services provided by the only USCG resource ON WESTERN SHORE OF THE MIDDLE BAY.  Portsmouth and Cape Charles are too far away, regardless of boat speed.

These members of Milford Haven are integral members of our community - they live here, support local businesses, and give back to our communities in so many ways.  Temporary assignments are not going to foster those kind of long term reciprocal relationships.

As a real estate broker, I know that individuals buy in this region BECAUSE we have so many amazing resources protecting our area.  Our economy WILL be impacted by the removal of this invaluable resource.",,,,,,,

REF: Doc # USCG - 2021 - 0238 - 0001 "" Consolidation of Redundant Coast Guard Boat Stations"" 

COMMENT: The proposed consolidation of Seasonal Station-Small Scituate, MA, with neighboring parent stations will neither create a more robust response system nor increase synergies or opportunities for training. This proposed closure will REDUCE response times and REDUCE training opportunities for Station Scituate's seasonal personnel, local USCG Auxiliarists, and the very active local boating community. Moreover, this closure would REDUCE boating safety by INCREASING response time to the most hazardous point between Boston and the Cape Cod Canal: the ""New Inlet"", or mouth of the North River. The North River mouth has been the scene of several fatal boating accidents, most recently earlier this summer. The North River mouth ( or ""New Inlet""as of 1898 ) is a 3.3 nautical mile run from the Station Scituate dock ( see attached photo). However, it is a 15.1 NM run from Station Allerton and a 15.5 NM run from Station Cape Cod Canal. Closing the Scituate Station will not eliminate a ""Redundant"" boat station, but will increase response times, decrease boating safety and eliminate a CRITICAL SAFETY RESOURCE on this heavily-used stretch of coastline. ""Seasonal Station - Small"" Scituate, MA, may be ""small"" and may be ""seasonal"", but it provides an enormously important ROI safety function that is out-of-proportion to it's ""small"" stature. I urge that every effort be made to ensure the continued operation of Seasonal Station - Small Scituate, MA.

Commercial fisherman and recreational boaters active after the summer cutoff will be left with only local first responders who are not as equipped to assist--though would make an honorable attempt.

Please consider the impact to the local economy and local education system as well as the  safety of the maritime activities so intrinsic to the area.  The local school system will likely lose 30 plus families from their already limited budget.  The tertiary impact to local retailers is more than can be easily calculated.  The area is surrounded on three sides by water....to be protected by local first responders and residents alone for the entirety of the fall and winter months.

Reconsider this action and maintain Station Milford Haven in its current year-round active status.  ",,,,,,,

Station Milford Haven’s AOR cover the majority of the middle of  the Chesapeake Bay and 3 major rivers and their tributaries. And is the largest AOR in SECVA. The 2 hr response time is unattainable in the upper reaches of the AOR. I’m guessing when you say seasonal, we’re talking May-October. That’s fine for recreational boating. But consider watermen who oyster from October to April. Consider “snow birds” who travel south in October/November and north in March/April. Not counting the commercial maritime traffic that goes thru daily 24/7/365. I understand there will be no reduction in force(RIF).  So there would be no economic savings in that regard. Putting a boat in storage for 6 months is costly. Taking it out is costly. Closing the station will cost as well as opening. Then there’s the cost for securing the premises when unoccupied. So considering this there will be NO savings. 
Now if you go seasonal you have a lot to consider. Personnel will be assigned TAD. So there’s the cost of per diem etc. again no savings. While certainly, you wouldn’t send unqualified people TAD, there is the cost of training. To include additional personnel to train and additional resources. Not counting the time. Plus factor in AOR Familiarization. Again NO savings.
 Matthew’s county, The county Station Milford Haven is located relies on the water, farming and logging to drive the economy. The Station is a smalll cog which helps that economy thrive. It’s a small community wherein folks rely on each other when needed. The Station is as much a part of the community as any other civic group. They are relied upon frequently. When there were no funds in 2018, the community provided for the crew so they could survive. They look up to the Coasties and ask only that the Coasties be there when needed. 
I ask that you reconsider the position of making Milford Haven seasonal

Other government agencies do not have the equipment and the man power to affect rescues as well as the Coast Guard, the fire boat from York county has a flat bow and can’t respond quickly at all in heavy seas, Gloucester and Abingdon fire have small whaler center consoles unable to respond in heavy seas, and state law enforcement agencies are not equipped with gas powered dewatering pumps, stokes baskets etc, and can’t safely perform many rescue functions as they often respond with one person on board.  The area served by Milford Haven isn’t filled with Police and Fire boats like Hampton Roads.  Responses to this area are typically Conservation Police or Marine Police and the coast guard.  The reasons for shuttering the station for half the year seem painted with a broad brush and none of them really apply to Milford Haven, causing me to believe the reason for this action was not based on the protection of life and property but rather for the protection of the Coast Guards budget, I urge you to reconsider and keep Milford Haven operating year round.  Other stations response time to Milford Havens AOR would often double response times, pushing over 4 hours in my estimation, making survival doubtful even with the protection of a dry suit.  ",,,,,,,

This Coast Guard station supports the communities of Cohasset, Scituate, and other contiguous communities. These coastal communities have substantial boating, swimming, kayaking, paddle boarding, and other water recreational activities and demand, which also creates risk to residents and visitors, as evidenced by recent drownings in Scituate. If the Scituate coast guard is shuttered, there will be a vast stretch of heavily-used coastline that is relatively far from the nearest coast guard stations in Massachusetts. This is particularly true in an emergency and/or mercurial weather during which response times matter. Thus, the Cohasset Select Board objects to the closure of the Scituate coast guard station, which jeopardizes the safety of Scituate, Cohasset, and neighboring communities, and urges the Coast Guard to reconsider its proposal.

In addition, eliminating the Scituate Guard station will put immense strain on the resources of the local police and harbormasters who are not equipped for serious heavy rescue missions.  While there is a station in Hull, the travel distance required to get to the North River or south of it will be greatly extended and may well result in loss of life and property.  Keep the Scituate station open during the recreational boating season on the the South Shore at a minimum in order to provide necessary public safety - do not close it completely.  Doing so will be penny wise and pound foolish.",,,,,,,

The ocean is at once many things: recreational for swimmers and boaters of  various abilities and experience; commercial including independent  fishermen and lobstermen as well as larger companies up to  internation globe-spanning conglomerates; and a natural wonder with myriad weather  possibilities and wondrous gifts. The Coast Guard  men and women assigned  to Scituate have been a vital part of our land /sea connection throughut my  nearly 80 years resident here. I recall many disasters  that could have been, would have been far more  serious without  the Coast Guard presence. Hurricanes  here   are  not unusual nor are Nor'Easters though some storms like the Blizzard of '78 are called 100 year storms. Even more vital, to me,  are the lifesaving activities that have saved  individuals and families  from  death. For most of these,  minutes or even seconds made the difference between life and death. Having Scituate, Cohasset, and Marshfield serviced from far away is a disaster waiting to happen. For the sake of those whose lives will be saved if the United States Coast Guard remains in Scituate, I extend. my prayerful plea, ""Stay in my backyard"".

I urge you not to vote to close the Scituate Massachusetts Coast Guard Station. Scituate is located in a very unique and storm prone area.  The residents of the area, commercial and recreational fishermen, boaters, and general public will be underserved with a loss of this location.  

Frequent storm surges resulting in high repetitive loss damage to the coast line, and a very active year round commercial fishing and recreational boating with a large number of annual rescues make the Coast Guard a significant resource.   

The loss of the Scituate station would be considered a significant risk to public health, safety and the environment with the dense population, high use and vulnerable coast line and tricky waters.  A closure would additionally result in added risk and burden to the local public officials and public safety rescue teams. 
 
Also repairs to this building/ facility have been undergoing and it would be a waste of public money to sell or abandon this station. 

Please do not close Scituate Coast Guard station. Thank you for the consideration.

The justification of the arrival time of ~25 minutes from Point Allerton to the Spit (mouth of North and South Rivers, Scituate & Marshfield, MA) on an ideal day and a 60+ minute arrival time from Point Allerton to Manomet/Plymouth, MA on an ideal day and is 'within the two-hour window for adequate arrival time"" is nothing short of reckless.  The USCG trains on ""every second counts"".  Very few water emergencies are on 'ideal days'.  The mouth of those rivers is (or at least was for decades) one of the 10 top deadliest waterways on the east coast.  We have more boats on the water these days and have been experiencing unexpected and/or severe storms and weather patterns are not forecasted to change anytime soon.  Residents have been notified that it costs the USCG an average of $3,000-$5,000 per year to keep the 29 foot USCG boat here annually.  To consolidate these stations makes no sense and is, in our opinion, not necessary and would be a reckless action.

I have been a boater for > 40 years & am familiar with tragedies that occur frequently on the Scituate/Hummarock coastline.  This year includes 1 death thus far from a boater who got tossed & drown when the Captain should have avoided a risky North River entrance.  

There are many new boaters out here due to the good economy & the highest amount of boat sales in history in the past 2 years.  Unfortunately many have zero boating experience & have never taken the Boater Safety Course.  Just this past weekend 3 different boats at 3 different days/times illegally cut right in front of us going > 25mph in very powerful boats- no warnings, no right of way, no looking back & realizing that they could have capsized us in a split second.  Yes, irresponsible, but it happens all the time.  

The CG Station & it's staff have been very helpful in many maritime rescues whether, swimmers, kayakers, sailer, boaters, sea life, surfers, etc. in Scituate waters.  I'm nervous out there as new & inexperienced boaters think it's the wild West; they have no idea of the rules nor the risks to take on an ever-changing ocean with current/wind/tides/storms that put their lives as well the life of others in dangers way.  Even our Harbormasters & Police Crew are put in danger due to stupidity every day.  Your response time & help has always been spot on & very much appreciated!  

I believe it's in the people's best interest & tax paying dollars favor to keep the Scituate CG Station open & operational. After careless displays of stupidity out on the ocean always I'm surprised there are not more fatalities.  One boater had 7 children with no life jackets, ages approx. 3-10, riding on the bow of his boat in sloppy 2-4 foot seas at a high speed with the wake curling over the top of his boat & then cut directly in front of us (he had a 31 foot craft and we a 25 foot one).  I fear for my life at  times and always enjoyed the fact that the CG is there to help in case of accidents with a stellar response time if & when we ever need to call ""Mayday"".  

Weather plays an important role & climate change as it's a fact that seas have become much more unpredictable.  So what turns out as a calm morning heading out over Stellwagen Bank with a calm forecast can become a nightmare for many crafts if suddenly the wind & currents change & storms pop up out of nowhere.  This has happened to us more than once.  One specific forecast was for clear skies & 20 mile clear visibility all day so we headed out to the Banks to fish & then the thickest fog ever rolled in out of nowhere. We have no radar but slowly made our way back to Scituate Harbor listening for any sound of an engine nearing us - it was like a nightmare as we couldn't see 10 feet in front of us & our young sons were aboard.  I had the radio ready to hail & call Mayday in case of an incident.  Another time we were crossing the Banks from Scituate to Provincetown & out of nowhere again a storm kicked up the seas going from 1-2 to 4-6 feet!  It was hairy but we took on the waves slowly as we were in the middle of the journey to make our way back.  Again we had confidence the the CG was nearby, not another 20 miles away.  These are just two personal examples in many over all the years we've boated on these shores.   

The boating industry is growing, not shrinking and so are water sports available on our coastline, so why shrink the CG support we all deserve and need?  Aren't there other ways to cut Budget dollars? More lives can be saved.  And not at the expense of concerned & potentially endangered citizens in a historical maritime area that includes not just pleasure craft but also a commercial fishing industry.  

Seconds do count in a seafaring tragedy!  Please reconsider & keep our Scituate CG Station open!  We The People of Scituate deserve this Governmental service.  Thank You.

If the Coast Guard decides to proceed with redundancy despite the myriad reasons to keep the Scituate Coast Guard station open and operational, I urge the Coast Guard to turn over the property to the Town of Scituate so that it can remain accessible to the public, and to prevent inappropriate coastal development by private developers.

Scituate and nearby communities attract people of all levels and abilities who hit the water and sometimes in rented vessels.  
Now even more that before the pandemic, families are flocking to the suburbs to find healthy alternatives and family fun on our shores. As a point to consider, beach town property prices have soared as a result of people looking for coastal access. Low cost kayaks, paddle boards, floats and boats can be seen everywhere, which is wonderful, but increases the area need for life saving services. This is no time to reduce these important services.

Additional things to consider: Our rocky shores often make navigation in the area difficult for even experienced boaters and swimmers. The mouth of the North River is at best traitorous countless days a year including when we lost a women there in spring this year. 

With global warming the storms are getting worse each year and the currents stronger. A thunderstorm July caught 2 young paddleboards unaware and one was pulled from the water and her companion was rescued hanging on a buoy.
As a result of the station closing, clearly response times would increase for our entire area greatly. We are an area of high need.
Below are but a few of the times the public has relied on our local station.

Just this summer (2021) alone, we have witness the importance of having CG personnel and equipment at this location. A recent article in the local newspaper quoted nearly all the local harbormasters, Cohasset, Scituate, Marshfield, and Plymouth and their voices were unanimous: having to rely on the Hull CG station in emergencies would have a detrimental effect of the response times for those boats and individuals in distress.

This is the reason all Boston TV stations send their mobile units down to see the devastation during storms.  The Coast Guard is a major player in helping our harbor master and his crew during these times.
We have a large tourist population coming into our harbor on boats, it is a perfect place to come into during a trip,to simply visit a grocery store, pharmacy, liquor store, go out to a resturuants, pump out and fuel sevices. It makes it easy for boaters to use and enjoy our harbor which also overlaods our harbor masster and his crew.  Services are all within walking distance to the marinas and piers.  It is also a harbor of shelter for boaters with small families during storms. These are extremely important issues that should not be over looked.  
The Coast Guard is only here during the boating season and therefore is NOT a strain on the  Federal System during those times of year when the boating season is slow and mainly fisherman are using our harbor.
Our fishing fleet also needs the support and help of the Coast Guard to keep them safe and able to earn a living, that is difficult to start with. Without the added worry that the coast guard will not be there if they should need them.
This is the 3rd time the federal government has tried to pull the Coast Guard out, Stop It we desperately need this coverage.",,,,,,,

I would like to support the continuation of staffing the Scituate USCG station in Scituate Harbor- at minimum during the summer months when the harbor provides anchorage and refuge for both commercial and pleasure craft. As dramatically shown in the recent loss of life in the North River inlet and surrounding area, the convergence of the North and South Rivers and resulting currents combine with tidal changes to present a continual challenge to boaters of all levels of ability in all sizes of watercraft, including kayaks. If the Scituate station is closed, rescues from the nearest USCG station in Hull would add potentially life-threatening extended response time in an emergency situation. In addition, the USCG vessel would have to navigate through Hull Gut and then in open ocean to reach the mouth of the North River in all conditions. With all due respect to USCG staff, these waters are complicated to navigate even in the best of conditions.
Thank you for your consideration.
Sincerely,
Bev Leute Bruce

two 30 ft. patrol boats, a maintenance building with a marine railway and
living quarters for the U.S.C.G personnel.

Later in life the U.S.C.G. downsized to a ""wooden"" shack with a motorized rubber craft and staffing only in the summer months.

Now the U.S.C.G. wants to completely close all operations from Scituate.

I would call to your attention that it is a long hard ride from the Pt. Allerton station to the waters off Scituate, and even further to the mouth of the North River, one of the most treacherous inlets on the entire east coast.

Yes there are local assets in the area, but nothing that compares to the
equipment and personnel of the U.S.C.G.

I implore you to rethink this closure proposal. We have witnessed just recently
what happens when the U.S. Military is removed from a crucial location, please don't let it happen here.

As a lifelong resident living on the Piankatank River, near this station, it is unfathomable to me that the USCG could consider closing this station for half of the year. While it is certainly true that there is far more boating activity in this area during the summer months than the winter, the waters surrounding this station are far from empty during the colder months. Recreational fishermen flock to the region for the November/December striped bass season. Watermen work the waters year round. Sailing and other recreational boating activities are still present. Should an emergency arise, the proximity of the next nearest Coast Guard stations if Milford Haven were to be closed would create a massive dearth in coverage. 

I can not imagine that the budget savings of mothballing the Milford Haven station for 6 months a year could be at all consequential to the USCG budget. The value in proximity and safety this station provides to this isolated area far outweighs any minor uptick in spending a larger station would get from its closure. The USCG absolutely must reconsider this decision, and continue its service and purpose of providing valuable protection to the western shore of the middle Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries.

There shouldn't be any closure of a USCG station anywhere, especially the Chesapeake Bay.  One of the many issues with the Government is there is too much of it.  So much, so that common sense goes right out the window.  

When a station is no longer is when accidents happen.  Gwen Island Station is as important on the Chesapeake Bay as any other USCG station. Even so, with the station, accidents will still occur.   

There are just too many situations that happen year-round when people young and old take to the waters of our bay.  There are many types of boating-related and water-related accidents.  Collisions capsized vessels, people falling overboard are just a few. There are also unfortunate boating failers, such as boating breaks down in rough sea conditions and a boat takes on water.  All of which impose a danger to those on board.  

The loss of a station means more pressure on other nearby 1st responders on land. The ripple effect is created by taking away a resource from the folks that are landbound.  Shouldn't we be trying to make the water safer and not less safe?  Again Govt!  The response time will also increase.  

With one less station on the bay? In 2019 Boat sales have soared, and more folks are boating and taking part in water-related activities now more than ever due to the COVID-19 outbreak. More people equals more accidents.  

I have boated and been on the water all my life.  I have never seen the carelessness and incompetence on our waters as much so as there is today.  As a professional Captain who holds a 100 Tn Master's Merchant Marine Credential, I strongly urge this closure to be reconsidered.  ",,,,,,,

Boating has increased dramatically over the past 2 years, putting thousands of new boaters on the water, making this decision even more misguided.

At a public meeting in Mathews County hosted by U.S. Rep Whitman when asked how many FTEs or money that would be saved by making it seasonal the Coast Guard Commander responded that no savings would be realized by this downgrade. She also agreed when asked about response times that it most likely would mean longer response times since the Coast Guard assets that would need to respond would be at a greater physical distance than is currently available.  Since the proposed closure is during the part of the year when the water temperatures are at its coldest any increased response time can be the difference between survival and death for someone that is in the water and needs help to survive.  The Coast Guard logic that due to faster boats that can respond in shorter times from further distance defies common sense. Most incidents seem to occur when the weather and sea conditions are bad. So that fast boat that can go 35 knots in calm seas might only be able to achieve 20 knots in bad conditions.  So the added distance will increase the response times in most cases. That added response time can and will be deadly when someone is in 35-50 degree water  that is common in the middle parts of the Chesapeake Bay and Tidal rivers during those months that Milford Haven would be closed.  We, the tax paying citizens of Mathews county as well as other jurisdictions of the Middle Peninsula and Northern Neck know a lot of our history as well as out economy depend on the  water and its safety.  We have always supported the Coast Guard and it's mission. In return the Cost Guard has always been there in our times of need. But over the last several years we have seen that support from the Coast Guard erode. First they decide to no longer support the Aids to Navigation (AToNs) in most of our waterways. We in Mathews decided to continue to support our citizens by migrating them to Private (AToNs) and taking over the maintenance for them. We are also in the process of getting dredging done on Milford Haven East (Hole-in-Wall) through hard work by many people.  Now we get hit with what we see as the next step of the Coast Guard as eventual closure of Milford Haven for rescues, not just seasonal. From our prospective two of the core responsibilities of the Coast Guard is Safety/Rescue and  Navigation which seem to be pulled from this area. The Coast Guard needs to return to its grassroots responsibilities and not putting its priorities on interdicting drug runners in the Caribbean and South America.  Yes those are important but should not take priories over the basic responsibilities here at home.",,,,,,,

As a long time resident of Mathews County, Virginia, I wish to express my opposition to the current proposal for changes to the US Coast Guard station on Gwynn's Island.  In addition to the Station being an integral part of our economic status here in Mathews, it is a huge part of our safety net for seamen, boaters and visitors who ply our waters.  This is a dreadful proposal and should be discarded.

We are proud to host a USCG station right here in Mathews. My family has hosted more than one young man stuck here for the holidays and maintain these friendships years later. If we have a man over board and  need assistance what happens ? The water is cold in Jan. and Feb. the coast guard from Milford Haven helped my father years ago when his work boat was caught in ice in the bay. The C G crew searched for several days for my Uncle Bobby when he went missing from his boat. That was the worst time of my life he didn’t survive but we knew the CG was there for us.

If Milford Haven is not operational, the nearest USCG facility is in Yorktown, VA. In good weather, a boat from Yorktown could reach Milford Haven in 60 minutes if the conditions are perfect. But if conditions were perfect, there probably wouldn't be any trouble that needed a response from USCG.

I am a member of many boating organizations and teach boating safety.  I am extremely concerned that the USCG is considering making Station Milford Haven a part-time operation.  I believe that this change could significantly reduce boating safety in Milford Haven's area of operation.  I often boat during the winter months and in addition to me, there are many other boats (primarily oystermen) also operating in the area.  In my primary area of operations (the Fleets Bay area), it currently takes Station Milford Haven vessels around 30 minutes to provide boating assistance. If Milford Haven does not operate during winter months, USCG rescue times to this area would be more than an hour, which could cause lives to be lost in winter-temperature waters,  In addition, during the summer months, USCG personnel manning Station Milford Haven would be temporary personnel (reservists, etc.) who would not be familiar with local waters. To be effective, the personnel at Station Milford Haven need to be full-time Coasties, living in the area and familiar with the local waters.

This is the data that needs to be examined, not data from 2017.
I had a recent conversation with employees of VMRC as well as other emergency responders in the area. They too are very concerned about the impact on their ability to handle impending emergencies should this occur. As one said, ""We can only be in one place at any given time and the other Coast Guard stations are too far away to respond in a timely fashion"".
Losing one life because of a prolonged response from emergency responders is one life too many.  I understand part time closures may ""save money"".

We have been boating in the area that Milford Haven covers for about 35 years and we boat year round.  We also know a lot of watermen that are out on the water year round because their livelihood depends on it.  There are a lot of shallow areas around that area that larger boats can’t get into.  The area where the Potomac River meets the Chesapeake Bay is a more challenging area for boaters.  Over the years I have been amazed how many boats in that area start taking on water or are overturned.  Because the Coast Guard at Milford Haven is close enough, they have been able to get there quickly and rescue people.  If those people had to stay in the water for two to two and a half hours waiting for a boat from farther away, they would have died from hypothermia.  We know some of these people personally.  The closing of Milford Haven for part of the year will endanger boaters and waterman.  The fall, winter and spring months are when it is most important for Milford Haven to be open to respond quickly to get people out of the water before they die of hypothermia.  How much money does it really save to close the station for 6 months out of the year?  There is the cost of closing up the station and then reopening the station.  Then there is the cost of moving the employees out of the area for 6 months and then moving employees back in for 6 months.  It doesn’t seem like it will really save that much money,.  It will just cost lives.  I urge you to keep Milford Haven Coast Guard Station open year round.",,,,,,,

   USCG Station Milford Haven located in Mathews, VA., is an essential operation to the Middle Bay and its environs. Closing it during the winter represents a potential catastrophic development to the local commercial and recreational fishing concerns. 
There are few entities that will respond to a Pan Pan, or Mayday in a timely fashion. So, the potential for loss of life increases exponentially should such a call come in during the colder months. 
Taking away this vital station endangers all mariners navigating the Middle of the Bay and severely reduces the effectiveness of the USCG response in a life or death emergency. 

Therefore, I am requesting the USCG not close this station.

We appreciate the professional and prompt response of the Milford Haven Coast Guard.  The Mathews County first responders do not have the equipment and expertise of the Coast Guard and the funding is not available to supplement the County first responders at this time.  There is a potential economic impact as commercial waterman may not be willing to accept the increased risk; therefore, opting to move their operations.

There is a lot of boating activity during the winter months including fishermen, sailors, commercial watermen and recreational boaters. By suspending wintertime hours, it would leave a huge void in response time to all of these boaters utilizing the water. For many years I was in the Coast Guard Reserves, stationed at Little Creek, I know that response time is critical in responding to boaters that are at risk. At present I live in White Stone, and I am aware of several boating accidents during winter months that have proven fatal.  Little Creek and Portsmouth are much too distant at approximately two hours to provide an adequate response. It is unrealistic to put the burden on Smith Point Rescue volunteers.

I would like to state my opposition to this proposal.  The area where I live, Northern Neck of Virginia and middle Chesapeake bay, has a very active  boating population.  This includes not just recreational boaters but more importantly hundreds of commercial fisherman, many consisting of one or two man operations.  These fisherman are on the water 12 months out of the year.  Obviously the winter months present a larger risk to life due to weather.  There is also a sizable population of recreation boaters out in winter due to seasonal fish regulations.  A boater in distress in January - in 40 ~ 50 degree water -  has a very short window for rescue.  The response time from the remaining year round stations is too long for anyone who finds themselves in an emergency situation.  Fisherman in this area have been hard hit over past years for a variety of reasons - declining fish stocks, increased overhead costs, foreign competition to name a few.  Please don't further the burden on the hard working, many multi generational men and women trying make a living off of these waters supplying a critical foods source to this nation.

In my office I see approximately 30 people a day and over the past 2 years I will see 1-2 people a day who have recently relocated to the area. This is in contrast to my previous 4 years in practice here where I  would rarely see individuals relocating to the area.  In general these are relatively active, retirement aged people.  I usually inquire as to whether they plan to spend time on the water.  The majority plan to buy or have already purchased center console boats with plans to spend time on the water fishing.  In my neighborhood, alone, we have had 2 retirement aged couples move into houses for sale. Both couples have purchased recreational fishing boats.  I think it is safe to say that, with the recent healthcare crisis, many people are moving out of the bigger cities and into rural areas where they can continue to work remotely.  I am certainly witnessing this phenomenon in my orthopedic practice and I suspect the real estate industry can verify this statement as well.  I am concerned that the decision by the U.S. Coast Guard to down size station Milford Haven is based on historical,(outdated), demographic data  which might show a predominance of seasoned commercial fisherman and seasonal saillors and boaters.  It has been noted by others that many of the fishing seasons extend into the periods of proposed downgraded services at Station Milford Haven.  I am also concerned that the demographics of this area has changed considerably over the past 2 years to include a younger, possibly less experienced boater that plans to spend time on the water during fishing seasons that extend past the proposed downgrade.  I fear that this creates a recipe for disaster having increased numbers of less experienced recreational boaters on the water during periods of suspended service by SMH. The Virginia Marine Police do a great job but I know that they are stretched thin and not capable of providing the manpower that SMH can. I would hope that the Coast Guard evaluates the significant fluctuation in demographics that has occurred over the past 2 years in this active boating community and reconsiders its decision to downgrade station Milford Haven.

As a town, we recently acquired a fire boat and we have multiple police and harbormaster marine units who do a great job during the summer months patrolling and responding to emergencies.  The fire boat was a great addition to our fire/police marine rescue fleet. If there was a fire on-board a commercial boat off of Scituate, we would need this vessel to respond.

Thank you for taking comments on the consolidation of the “redundant” Scituate Coast Guard Station into the Hingham Coast Guard area.

At this particular time in our country I believe any decision to incorporate the Scituate Coast Guard into Hingham would be an unwise one. 

While both our Southern and Northern national borders are virtually non-existent at this time; and, because the present threat of terrorism to the continental United States is at a dangerous level because of the fall of Afghanistan to the Taliban, I believe that decreasing surveillance coverage of our coastal waters poses a real threat, not only to our local area, but to the nation as a whole.

I also believe that any response from Hingham to a boating emergency would be challenging because to the distance to be covered, endangering lives and property. So too, the local educational boating instruction is invaluable to the safety of our boaters; I fear the loss of such service would seriously undermine the safety of our local boating citizens. The confidence Scituate residents have always had in the presence of the United States Coast Guard in our local waters would be seriously compromised.

I hope, despite the budget cuts and underfunding by the present administration in Washington, you will find a way to keep our long relationship with the noble men and women of the United States Coast Guard intact.

Keep up your noble work in protecting the safety of our citizens and the security of our nation.

Thank you again for the opportunity to share my thoughts on this matter.

Sincerely yours,

WATERWAYS COMMISSION

 

September 20, 2021

John W. Mauger
Rear Admiral
U.S. Coast Guard
Assistant Commander for Capability     

Dear Rear Admiral Mauger,
          
I am writing you to express our grave concerns that the Scituate Waterways Commission has regarding the proposed closure of the seasonal Coast Guard Station located in Scituate, Massachusetts.
The Scituate Waterways Commission which represents over several thousand boaters in the Scituate and surrounding waters, is submitting our response regarding the recent notice that the Scituate Coast Guard Station is planned to close next year (docket USCG-2021-0238). We strongly believe this decision should be immediately reversed with the Station continuing to operate on a summer schedule.
One of the stated explanations was there has been “…. an overall reduction in rescue calls...”. Maybe this is true for some of the other stations under consideration, but certainly not the Scituate, MA location. We have seen an increase of 20+% in rescue calls over the past 2 years. In addition, there have been 2 water related deaths in 2021, as well as many rescues.
According to Lt. Brandon Newman (Coast Guard spokesman) “…while there may be an increase in response times, crews from either Hull or a station in Sandwich would be able to get to the South Shore in the standard two-hour response time.” We would like to point out that the University of Minnesota Duluth (Sea Grant) has determined that at a surface temperature of 40 to 50 F, a person will lose consciousness in 30 to 60 minutes, and can likely swim only 7 to 40 minutes. With water temperatures of 50 to 60 F, a person can sustain swimming for 40-75 minutes. Historical minimum water temperatures in Scituate average 44.6 degrees in May and 53.8 degrees in June. Closing the Scituate Station, and responding in 2 hours will jeopardize lives in these dangerous waters.
Another major concern for this area is the lack of available resources during nighttime hours in the event of an emergency.  Currently the Scituate Harbormasters office and Scituate Police department Marine unit do not operate nor are staffed from 12:00 a.m. until 8:00 a.m. during the summer months.  Any emergency that occurs off Scituate during these nighttime hours could leave recreational boaters, commercial fishermen, and recreational fishermen without someone to call for help, especially if a small boat is out of VHF emergency radio range to Pt. Allerton Hull or Plymouth MA. 
We are hope that the potential closing of the Scituate Station is not a financial decision by the USCG, where dollars count more than protecting lives? It had been stated by USCG Lt. Brandon Newman said the one boat stationed in Scituate and its four-person crew would be reassigned to Point Allerton full time, therefore the only cost is approximately $3,000 for the annual use of the building in Scituate Harbor. The Coast Guard has a FY’22 Budget of $13.1 Billion, and $3,000 seems to be a miniscule fraction of that Budget. However, the Scituate WWC would be open to discussing how we could absorb the $3,000 annual cost if the Scituate Station would remain open. 
Scituate Harbor and the North River in Scituate Ma is home to approx. 2,000 Moorings and Slips, as well as hundreds of day boaters launching boats from trailers on multiple ramps. The neighboring towns have several hundred boaters operating out of their waters. In addition, we have a thriving commercial fleet- according to the Massachusetts DMF, Scituate is a top 5 port by Ex-Vessel Value for Groundfish in 2018. Finally, the North River inlet is regarded as one of the most treacherous inlets on the Massachusetts Coast- there have been many Coast Guard SAR’s over the past decade in those waters.
We have established a deep working relationship with Sector Boston, and greatly appreciate the work done at the Scituate Coast Guard Station. The joint working relationship between the Harbormaster, SPD, SFD and the Coast Guard functions exceedingly well; and closing the Scituate Station would create a dangerous environment for the Region. As you know, the motto of the United States Coast Guard is Semper Paratus- “always ready”. There is no way removing the Scituate MA Station lives up to that motto- please follow your motto and be ready to protect lives and the health, safety and welfare of our tax paying residents.

VDOT is planning a swing bridge repair, that simply will not be possible once they grasp the stability deterioration because of the water rise.  Let me be blunt and register my offense at the CG PR explanation of the mariner's death (colliding with the Wolf Trap (Extinguished, unlit) light:  that Cape Charles was closer.  This is simply not true.  The Station Milford personnel could have but did not transit Hole in the Wall passage - because the Federal Government cut the marks down - because the Sequestration and Shutdown Congressional geniuses were more interested in scorched earth politics and making a stupid point - that resulted in a death of a sailor.  We can easily train the more experienced local watermen to fill this 'void."" They know how to transit HITW to rescue a mariner in distress.  I could riff about the CG personnel in the government car running 86 mph (reckless driving) on 14, and an assault complaint with a retiree as a victim, but our Government no longer cares about integrity in public service.",,,,,,,

As a 50+ year user of the Scituate MA waterways I strongly oppose that the USCG is attempting to close this VERY important station location for the following reasons:

Over 15 deaths in the north river mouth in the last 15 years --The USCG has saved lives there 

The peer group of sister stations the USCG wishes to close have a user population 10x less that the Scituate user population in the USCG working area.  For instance the Mid West areas being considered for closure have user populations of appx 36,000 versus the Scituate user population of over 200,000 users.

We have over 2,000 boats in the Scituate waterways system(s)

With the advent of many new post COVID users, the user demand is even higher 

The Scituate station can respond in 4-7 minutes verus 40+ minutes from the Point Allerton / Hull station, P town statin or Cape Cod Canal station.

WE NEED SCITUATE TO REMAIN --DO NOT CLOSE!!

Sincerely,
Capt. Brad White

There would not be an impact on things like shipping, as it is not used for that, and since it would not be a state issued rule, it should not affect or imbalance the jurisdiction of any certain part of the water by any state. Therefore, I support the rule prohibiting entrance to a section of the Potomac for protection of event partakers.

Subject:  Docket Number: USCG-2021-0301-0001
To whom it may concern: 
1 - CSX has changed their rail yard operating schedule to open the bridge to vessel traffic each day from 6:30 a.m.-7:30 a.m., 2:30 p.m.-3:30 p.m. and 10:30-p.m.-11:30 p.m.
2 - CSX will open the bridge on signal at all other times if there are no trains on the bridge.
3 - This change will allow vessel operators to schedule their trips through this bridge and to pass through at all other times when there are no trains on the bridge.
Rebuttal to the temporary deviation granted to CSX to close a waterway down to navigation in docket number USCG-2021-0301-0001.
1 -   Title 33 Navigational and Navigable Water / Part 162.75 (1) A states – A clear channel shall at all times be left open to permit free and unobstructed navigation by all types of vessels and tows normally using the various waterways covered by the regulations of the section. 
a)	Having the bridge open 3 times a day for an hour is not sufficient time to allow maritime companies and vessels adequate time to schedule and complete their transits.
b)	This proposal will put maritime companies and their customers at an unfair economic disadvantage in moving commerce when compared to rail transportation.  This will allow CSX the ability to control a navigable waterway creating an advantage in production while putting the maritime community at a disadvantage.
2 – What will stop CSX from utilizing the bridge at all times by parking a train on the bridge?
a)	A Commerce Clause should always be enacted to allow free navigation, “Gilman V. Philadelphia”. “Commerce includes navigation.  The power to regulate commerce comprehends the control for that purpose, and to the extent necessary, of all the navigable waters of the United States which are accessible from a State other than those in which they lie.  For this purpose, they are the public property of the nation, and subject to all requisite legislation by Congress.  This necessarily includes the power to keep them open and free from any obstruction to their navigation, interposed by the States or otherwise; to remove such obstructions when they exist; and to provide, by such sanctions as they may deem proper, against the occurrence of the evil and for the punishment of offenders”. 
b)	The statement “if they are no trains on the bridge” should be eliminated for the purpose to       allow free navigation of the waterway.  This statement will allow CSX the ability to build their trains across the waterway with no regard to the maritime community. 
c)	This will result in an unsafe condition and endanger the public and transportation industry. This proposal will create a backlog of vessels and barges in an area that is already congested by a major bridge, numerous docks and a dredge that is working on a project to deepen the Mobile River.  

3 - This will create an unfair economic disadvantage to the maritime community as companies do not have a dedicated vessel to take advantage of each opening.
a)	We currently have the availability to send our vessel through this bridge site only when a vessel is in Mobile harbor.  Restricting the maritime community access to this waterway to limited times will have a significant impact to local customers and the maritime industry,  along with putting undue economic increasers to the business users in the area that use marine transportation for their form goods.
b)	The maritime community will either pass the extra cost to the customer or will absorb the extra cost.

One hour is not enough time to setup a dock and return to the river. On occasion multiple shifts are needing to be made in three mile, from dock to dock, possibly taking 2-3 hours. This would leave the boat stranded behind the bridge for an extra 5-6 hours when he may be needed in the river for other jobs. The bridge also takes 10-15 minutes just to open and does not start the process of opening until the alloted time, this turn the hour opening into a 45 minute opening. Just a few weeks ago we needed to retrieve a barge in three mile, we arrived 20 minutes before the scheduled opening, contacted the bridge tender and was told the bridge would be opening soon for the hour. In that time no trains were on the bridge nor did any train transit the bridge. The bridge started opening at the scheduled time and once it was open we had 45 minutes retrieve our barge. We were able to do so in the alloted time but the other boat waiting with us for the bridge was not so lucky. He had 2 barges to bring out of three mile and had to wait for another opening. Many times I have called the bridge tender and was told that he would open after the train had passed over his bridge, just to wait 30 minutes to an hour before the train was even transiting the bridge.",,,,,,,

Why should my business suffer the cost of this bridge being strictly operated to needs and convenience of CSX Railroad since Three Mile Creek is a federal waterway and CSX was a where of this when they built this bridge in the first place. 
We all share the the waterways and I would think CSX would want to act more responsible than to impede business on Three Mile Creek.

Smoke alarms have been in use for over 50 years saving lives and property, particularly while people sleep – but not on a Coast Guard compliant Subchapter T vessel.

 

The USCG–2021–0306 docket incorporates by reference the material in 181.450.  The docket also states: “…will now require an interconnected fire detection system that meets the existing requirements in 181.450…”.   The existing Subchapter T 181.450 requirements calls for “Single Station Smoke Detector – also suitable for use in a Recreational Vehicle”.  Is the proposal accurate? 

 

The UL217 Standard encompasses three separate listings – household devices, recreational vehicle devices, and marine devices.  The availability and options for recreational vehicle listed devices and marine listed devices is extremely limited or even non-existent.  Household devices do offer a better selection of options such as RF interconnectivity and location identification but lack the slightly more stringent UL testing of an RV or marine device.  What are the Coast Guard’s intentions with these listing options?

 

Over 25 years ago, the Coast Guard funded an Underwriters Laboratories Inc. study titled “Report on Project 92NK26482 Fire Detection in Recreational Vessels”.  The report evaluated, favorably, a number of “home or building” type smoke alarms using actual vessel fires and laboratory testing at UL in North Carolina.  I am not aware of anything that was ever done with the information obtained through this grant.  Since this study was authored, smoke detector “end of life” notifications and improved manufacturing processes have delivered even more reliable smoke alarms to the marketplace.  I for one am comfortable with these household devices in the dry spaces of a vessel. 

 

Please explain if you are intending to keep the requirement for UL Recreational Vehicle Listed devices or if the household listed devices will comply.  Other marine standards writing organizations are moving away from requiring specific RV or Marine listed smoke alarms.

 

Further, a vessel the size and value of the Conception with overnight accommodations should be investing in better fire detection equipment than UL217 single station smoke alarms.  An overnight subchapter T vessel should have a fire alarm system that is tested and listed to UL268 Smoke Detectors for Fire Alarm Systems.  At the very least this UL268 listing should appear as an option, if not a recommendation for Subchapter T vessels.  Other devices can be integrated into a system like this and will provide a number of additional security improvements for the vessel, passengers and crew.",,,,,,"https://downloads.regulations.gov/USCG-2021-0306-0005/attachment_1.jpg,https://downloads.regulations.gov/USCG-2021-0306-0005/attachment_1.pdf",

At the very least this UL268 listing should appear as an option, if not a recommendation for Subchapter T vessels.  Other devices can be integrated into a system like this and will provide a number of additional security improvements for the vessel, passengers and crew.

The Conception fire was a great tragedy that should have never happened. As I recall, there was negligence on the crew of the Conception and lack of due diligence. 

As terrible as that disaster was, it was a very rare, avoidable incident that should not be repeated as long as passenger vessel owners and crew do what they are required to do under current rules.

The whole industry should not be punished for this isolated, bad incident.


I would submit passenger boats have a cover or placard over outlets that are accessible passengers stating that multiple devices can cause a fire hazard.

I agree with emergency fire fighting and emergency egress training for crew and emergency egress training for each time overnight accommodation spaces are used.

I agree with a posted emergency egress plan.

I strongly disagree with existing vessels having to meet the same requirements as outlined for new vessels because making those changes may be physically impossible or cost too much.

I strongly disagree with the use of monitoring device for watchmen. There is no reason that a crewmember cannot make periodical reports to the bridge in person or via and intercom or walkie. 

Fire detection systems should be determined on a boat specific basis. If  battery operated devices installed in machinery specific areas can be heard from all areas of the boat while engines are running, that should be sufficient. These devices can be checked and logged each time fire safety is logged.

As a 4th generation passenger vessel owner/operator that has been working on T vessels all my life (going on 45 years myself), I am concerned that I may soon be  regulated out of a way of life. With the exception of a few bad players, our industry has had a very good safety record. 

My vessel is one of the newer party/fishing boats on the East coast, having been built in 2005. I feel I’ve had a great working relationship with my Coast Guard district inspectors over the years. However, these last 4 years it seems I cannot keep up with new requirements. It seems that my experience and the experience of other operators count for nothing. I agree that we, in our industry, want to run a safe vessel –but there needs to be common-sense discernment and --since vessels are not all built the same-- special consideration needs to be met individually.

Thank you for your consideration

French",,,,,,"I have spoken with my local USCG inspector several times regarding the recent MSID regarding fire safety and its effect on my vessel.   He has been very honest and patient, but through no fault of his own, he can offer no substantive information on this MSID.  This is very frustrating and unacceptable.  These new rules have major implications on our vessels and future business, but the USCG locally is not able to field questions on how to implement these changes on our vessels.   
Since I cannot get answers to any specific questions, I am hamstrung on taking any action at this point.  The new regulations came out on Dec 28th and we were given 90 days (till March 28th) until several of these new rules go into place.  Those specific rules require research, preliminary plans, approval, capital purchases, system alterations and inspections.  It is unreasonable to hold us to this timeline if the USCG cannot answer a single specific question on the rule (as of Jan 25).   I have asked to schedule a walk through of my vessel, but the local inspector felt (correctly) that is was too early for that step because the USCG is not clear on the exact implementation of these rules and would be unable to make any decisions.   I understand that the regulations regarding egresses don’t go into effect until 2023, but the public comment period established for these rules closes in June 2022.  It is impossible to make comments on these regulations without further understanding.  For example, does CFR 177.500 (o) apply for my vessel.  It directly contradicts the initial statement of the MSID regarding 2 escape egresses.  Which is correct?  We need answers to these questions and the local USCG needs to be able to answer them for operators to take action.  
By rolling out these new regulations so quickly the USCG is requiring operators to take immediate action.  I am attempting to do just that but cannot get a single technical answer.   I am left sitting on my hands, unable to plan financially or technically for rules that will go into effect on March 28th.   It is not reasonable to expect us to implement CFRs on this timeline.  
Lastly, MSIB 02-22 contains regulations that could potential alter our vessels and therefore our business and life’s in substantial ways.  If a vessel knows they will not meet the new egress regulations for overnight accommodations, they need the time to make business decisions.  A change to daysailing, selling the boat,  moving home ports or just shutting down are all potential outcomes.  These are major life altering decisions that require planning.  December of 2023 may seem far away  but please understand the potential gravity of these regulations on our vessels.

These regulations were mandated by Congress in December 2020 so we feel any delays would continue to put passengers on vessels at risk.  We are grateful to now see these Interim Regulations being implemented by the USCG. Boat owners/operators have had over one year to prepare for the implementation of these regulations and research materials needed for any upgrades or additions as well as make inquiries as to labor availability.

One comment relates to getting direction and answers from the USCG and hopefully they are able to resolve their questions prior to March 2022.

The Conception disaster was not an ""isolated incident"".  A review of investigations by the NTSB of maritime disasters over the past decade clearly documents  numerous preventable tragedies involving loss of life.  The recommendations from those investigations are now some of the Interim Regulations finally being implemented.  ALL vessels should be held to the same high safety standards and owner/operators should be the first to want to ensure the highest level of safety to the passengers who entrust their lives to them when they board their vessel.  A watch monitoring device is a simple way to ensure and document that indeed a crew member is fulfilling that duty while passengers are aboard.  Interconnected fire detection is crucial to enable a crew to respond immediately in the event of a fire that can erupt in an area not manned.

We implore the USCG to go forward with implementing the Interim Regulations as listed in March 2022 and those with extended dates on schedule. We cannot bring back our son or the other 33 others lost that tragic morning but if these sensible safety requirements save one life then our son's life will not have been lost in vain.

We represent owners and operators of small guide boats, uninspected 6 passenger or less vessels, and USCG COI vessels that can carry up to 150 passengers.  Some of our members operate overnight trips.  We will be submitting more detailed comments before the June '22 deadline and have several questions about the proposed rule.
Will the proposed new requirements apply to all small passenger vessels, uninspected 6 or less passenger vessels and USCG COI vessels?  Will the new requirements for vessels on overnight trips apply to uninspected 6 or less passenger vessels as well as USCG COI vessels?  Will the additional manning requirements for watch standers apply to uninspected 6 passenger vessels?
We strongly suggest that the March 28, 2022, implementation date of the interim rule be delayed until such time as more clarity and understanding of the proposed interim rule is provided so vessel owners and operators will have a clear understanding of the proposed rules.  In addition, we suggest more time is necessary for USCG inspectors to fully understand the proposed changes so they will be able to provide clear and understandable guidance to the vessel owners and operators on what they will need to do to be compliant and how long they will have to come under compliance.  In the vast majority of our country March is the month when most for hire charter activity begins and USCG personnel will need to fully understand what will be required, how long to be in compliance, and help the owners and operators understand the proposed changes without disrupting the for-hire charter businesses and their customers.  
The proposed rule includes substantial and costly changes to many vessels and the owners and operators will need time to fully understand the proposed changes and be able to install new safety devices and make other changes to their vessels.  Trying to do this and trying to provide the service to the public at the same time will be a daunting task.  At a minimum we request the implementation of the interim rule be moved to the fall of '22 which is the normal down time for most for hire charters.
We fully understand the rationale for the proposed changes as we have been involved with this issue since a few days after the tragic dive boat accident.  We have worked to prepare our members but until now have not known to what extent and what new safety gear would be required.  We look forward to working with the USCG and continue working with the other passenger vessel associations on continuing providing a safe and reliable service to the public we serve.

I, along with my business partner Benjamin Welzenbach, operate the Schooner Heritage; a traditionally rigged sailing vessel which sails out of Rockland, Maine offering overnight sailing excursions.

The disaster aboard the CONCEPTION was a tragedy caused by gross and criminal negligence. We have always worked closely with our local USCG inspectors to provide safe trips for our guests and crew. We work hard to stay in compliance and take pride in our safety record. 

The new fire safety regulations are not a one-size-fits-all fix. Vessels are not designed and built the same and consideration needs to be given accordingly. Expecting us to redesign our vessels will be the end of many of these historic sailing vessels, which have had an excellent safety record for three quarters of a century.

When asked, our local USCG inspectors, who have extensive knowledge of our vessels and industry, have no knowledge of how these regulations will apply to us. They do not have enough information. And yet some of these regulations are to be enforced as soon as March 28 of this year. We cannot even submit diagrams to get approval for these systems as the local USCG has no information. 

There needs to be additional time for discussion and research for these regulations.

For example, watch alert system. BNWAS, Bridge Navigational Watch Alarm System. These systems are designed for vessels that are actively navigating underway through day and night. The requirements for monitoring an overnight bridge watch on a vessel underway-including reset times and interfacing with motion detectors, navigation equipment, etc.- are not compatible with those of a night watch for a vessel at anchor which has no bridge. The timer reset period is 3-12 minutes. It isn’t even possible to perform a proper boat check in 3-12 mins. BNWAS systems are not suitable for this purpose and appropriate alternative systems do not exist. So, who designs this by March 28th? We do not have the information at the local level to identify appropriate equipment nor get plans approved.

This is just one example out of the many proposed regulations that are rushed, under-researched, and written without discussion or representation across the industry, or local agencies. 

The USCG must delay the enforcement of these regulations and give proper time for comments and discussion.

The canal is also unusable in the winter and summer due to ice formation and migratory wildlife.  By keeping the canal closed off to larger vessels, it will prevent harm to the water way and wildlife throughout the year. ",,,,,,,

Historically, the Coast Guard has provided a drawtender to be available to lift the Indianapolis Blvd bridge on a 24/7 basis. During the US Amy Corps of Engineers’ dredging activities in the Indiana Harbor Ship Canal, there was a need for a drawtender to be readily available on demand because of frequent movement of barges, boats, and other equipment affiliated with the dredging operation. The Federal Register notice included inaccurate information in stating that the Corps dredging operation occurs only a few weeks per year. In fact, when the Corps is dredging and disposing material into the CDF, the Corps may request that the bridge be lifted on a regular basis during the entire dredging season, which is often weather dependent and can run anywhere from March through December each year.

The Corps dredging operations are currently on pause while work is being done to raise the dikes of the Confined Disposal Facility (CDF) which sits just north of the Canal and west of Indianapolis Blvd. However, after the dikes are raised (currently scheduled to be completed in 2023), the Corps plans to resume maintenance dredging in 2024.

The East Chicago Waterway Management District (the “District”) objects to the proposed change in the availability of a drawtender for the Indianapolis Blvd bridge from 24/7 availability to a 12-hour advance notice, unless the following conditions are included in the final determination. If the frequency of vessel traffic increases, either because of Corps dredging activities or because of increased vessel traffic affiliated with other commercial or recreational activities, the Coast Guard must provide a drawtender on a 24/7 basis during times when vessel traffic is frequent, or some other alternate as-needed basis that meets the needs of the vessel operators.

Note that this part of the river is the narrowest part with three restaurants and a marina that also sells gas so there is an extreme amount of traffic.

These manned bridge tenders are a vital part of the safety on the river. They not only operate the bridges for boats but they keep an eye out for unsafe boating. I have heard them remind people that children are required to have life jackets on when in a boat. They also can coordinate bridge openings by seeing what groups of vessles are approaching and which need the right of way for safe passage. On the Loos cruise boat is a paddle wheeler that needs special handling for bridge openings and someone in a remote camera station will not be able to give them the proper attention they need. I could just imagine the barge traffic as well that needs personal attention for safe passage along the river. Removing these vital sets of eyes from the river is a huge mistake. A small image on a screen does not replace a person's own depth perception and intuitions when sitting at those controls. This is ""Penny wise and Pound foolish"".

I love the idea of cutting costs but I have had several times this summer that I have waited for up to 30 minutes waiting for a bridge opening. That would be fine but there’s several bridges and that ends up being over an hour to get through Oshkosh. Then if you catch the railroad bridge it’s a couple of hours. Monday through Thursday it would probably be good but  Friday through Sunday it’s way too much for one person. Also there’s one possibility two of the bridges that have issues at times. If there’s no one there it could be horrible for us boaters. Hopefully you get a lot of feedback but I’m guessing you probably won’t. I personally hope that this doesn’t happen full time on the bridges. I have to open all the bridges 90% of the time to get through. I can get under Wisconsin Ave as long as it’s 13’.

What navigational hazards do vessels operating in the study area face?  Please describe.
Answer: - No hazards observed or faced during approaching Los Angeles.
 
2.	Are there strains on the current vessel routing systems, such as increasing traffic density associated with future growth?  Please describe.
Answer: -Not observed heavy traffic density during approaching Los Angeles , Bridge team members experience  in the area. 
 
3.	Are modifications to existing vessel routing measures needed to address hazards and improve traffic efficiency in the study area?  If so, please describe.
Answer: -Better control on the Pleasure crafts and Sunday sailors 
 
4.	What costs and benefits are associated with the measures listed as potential study considerations?  What measures do you think are most cost effective?
Answer: -Stringent regulation for Sunday sailors and pleasure crafts will result in Safer approach and limited problems to USCG in handling the traffic or emergencies
 
5.	What impacts, both positive and negative, would changes to existing routing measures or new routing measures have on the study area?
Answer:  Safer approach and limited problems to USCG in handling the traffic or emergencies
 
6.	Where do you transit?  Where are your transit routes?  What criteria are used in determining your transit routes?
Answer:-Mainly Far east .Criteria are Safest and effective routing , Safety of Navigation/ Environment and Cost saving
 
7.	Do you currently experience competing uses for the same waterway areas or transit routes?  If so, please describe.
Answer: -Yes
 
8.	Do you anticipate, or are you aware of, future competing uses for the same waterway areas or transit routes?  These could include potential offshore energy projects, potential offshore aquaculture projects, or otherwise.
Answer: - Not anticipating in any of described projects. Rising of world’s economy and trade post-Covid can lead to heavy traffic in the routes , but there is no such a congestion of fishing vessels and coasters like in other areas of the world . Far East has much more challenges due to language barrier and sheer volume of traffic

9.	Are there other environmental, cultural, tribal, marine mammal or other impacts which should be considered during this Port Access Route Study.
Answer: The Whale crossing, and the Environmental impact is very critical

The following is the reply to Coast Guard nine topics. (No. USCG-2021-0345.)    (Part 1 / 2)
(1) What navigational hazards do vessels operating in the study area face?  Please describe.

Comment:
1. Pacific Missile Test Range & hazardous military operations may impede the vessels operating in the study area.
2. Both commercial fishing vessels and recreational vessels may impede the vessels operating in the study area.
3. Any tow that the towing vessel is unable to control or can control only with difficulty may impede the vessels operating in the study area.
4. Any vessel does not make passing arrangements with other vessel on VHF may impede the vessels operating in the study area.
5. Vessel engaged in fishing within the TSS may impede the passage of any vessel following a traffic lane in the study area. 
6. Vessel of less than 20 meters in length or sailing vessel within the TSS may impede the safe passage of a power-driven vessel following a traffic lane in the study area. 
7. Any emergency or unusual event on the vessel such as fire, collision, grounding, man overboard, etc., within the TSS may impede the passage of any vessel following a traffic lane in the study area.  
8. Any condition on the vessel that may impair its navigation, reduce its capabilities or affect the safety of other vessels due to defective propulsion, defective steering, inoperative navigation running lights, unusual handling, impaired maneuverability, inoperative whistle or horn, navigation equipment, etc., within the TSS may impede the safe passage of any vessel following a traffic lane in the study area. 
9. A vessel joining or leaving a traffic lane does not steer a course to converge or diverge from the direction of traffic flow in the traffic lane at as small an angle as possible may impede the passage of any vessel following a traffic lane in the study area.
10. A vessel crossing a traffic lane does not, to the extent possible, maintain a course that is perpendicular to the direction of the flow of traffic in the traffic lane may impede the passage of any vessel following a traffic lane in the study area.
11. A vessel proceeding in a traffic lane does not keep the separation zone to portside may impede the safe passage of any vessel following a traffic Lane in the study area.
12. A vessel anchoring in a Traffic Separation Scheme or in areas near its terminations may impede the safe passage of any vessel following a traffic Lane in the study area.

(2) Are there strains on the current vessel routing systems, such as increasing traffic density associated with future growth?  Please describe.
Comment:
If the operators of these vessels have obeyed all International Rules of the Road, with special emphasis on Rule 9 (Narrow Channels) and Rule 10 (Traffic Separation Scheme), comply with all other measures of safe navigation and prudent seamanship while operating within the current vessel routing systems, there are no strains on the current vessel routing systems.
(3) Are modifications to existing vessel routing measures needed to address hazards and improve traffic efficiency in the study area?  If so, please describe.

Comment:
There is no need to modify the existing ship route to solve the hazards in the study area and improve traffic efficiency at present.
(4) What costs and benefits are associated with the measures listed as potential study considerations?  What measures do you think are most cost effective?

Comment:
Shall be have a good and healthy company image & Cost reduction are associated with the measures listed as potential study considerations.
The best way is shortening the distance of the Shipping Safety Fairway and/or routing for the movement of vessel traffic proceeding to or from ports or places.

(5) What impacts, both positive and negative, would changes to existing routing measures or new routing measures have on the study area?

Comment:
1. The positive impacts of changing to existing routing measures or new routing measures have on the study area which can get more safe access routes for the movement of vessel traffic.
2. The negative impacts of changing to existing routing measures or new routing measures have on the study area which may increase operating costs if the Shipping Safety Fairway and/or routing for the movement of vessel traffic proceeding to or from ports or places farther away the existing routing.

(6) Where do you transit?  Where are your transit routes?  What criteria are used in determining your transit routes?
Comment:
1. When proceeding to or from the port of Los Angeles/Long Beach that we transited Santa Barbara Traffic Separation Scheme or Voluntary Western Traffic Lanes endorsed by Los Angeles/Long Beach Harbor Safety Committee, transited Traffic Separation Scheme in the Gulf of the Farallones /San Francisco Bay proceeding to or from the port of Okland.CA. there we also have transited Traffic Separation Scheme in the Straits of Juan De Fuca/Puget Sound proceeding to or from the port of Seattle/Tacoma, WA.
2. The criteria used in determining transit routes are complying with all international, federal, state or local laws and regulations, for the purpose of enhancing safe, environmentally sound and efficient maritime transportation, and vessels within the transit routes shall be responsible for their safe navigation in accordance with existing international and local rules (including the Harbor Safety Plan).

(7) Do you currently experience competing uses for the same waterway areas or transit routes?  If so, please describe.
Comment:
1. Los Angeles Western Approach/Santa bar bara channel                           
2. Oakland: TSS of San Francisco

(8) Do you anticipate, or are you aware of, future competing uses for the same waterway areas or transit routes?  These could include potential offshore energy projects, potential offshore aquaculture projects, or otherwise.
Comment:
Future competitive uses of the same waterway area or transport route in offshore energy projects, potential offshore aquaculture projects or other projects is unpredictable.

(9) Are there other environmental, cultural, tribal, marine mammal or other impacts which should be considered during this Port Access Route Study.
Comment:
The impacts of the Pacific Missile Test Range & hazardous military operations, Offshore wind power generation systems, Commercial fishing vessels and recreational vessels, Large whales including Blue, Fin and Humpback whales, as well as other marine mammals, these species are protected under the Federal Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1538 et seq.), the Marine Mammal Protection Act (16 U.S.C. 1361 et seq.), and the National Marine Sanctuaries Act (16 U.S.C. 1431 et seq.) which should be considered during this Port Access Route Study.

	We have concerns for vessels that are caught north of the WEA in rough weather or with power issues and need to come home ASAP.  They need to go thru the WEA rather than go around.   Especially if this occurs at night or in the fog, going thru the WEA will be extremely dangerous since radar is rendered ineffective in a WEAs.   I feel there needs to be a wide 4 NM corridor ( we are between San Francisco and Los Angeles harbors with multiple large barges, ships, tugs and tows traveling across our waters). We will need the corridors well lighted on both sides like a “runway” thru the WEA.  They will need a similar lighted corridor to go around the WEA. 
	Also, in the area of the WEA, the local fishing fleet should be outfitted with Pulse Compression Radars to help mitigate for the false targets and interference caused by the blades of the wind turbines.  
	There needs to be corridors for the WEA Service Operation Vessels (SOV) to use.  We need to know where we can safely set our gear. 
	It is very important that these corridors are decided before BOEM leases the area, otherwise there will be issues with Wind Companies not wanting to share their area.

However, having an adjoining traffic separation scheme for smaller recreational and commercial vessels (Such as is used in the streets of Juan de Fuca) would be an excellent idea. We have traveled the West Coast from Cape flattery to San Diego and have noted Many areas that should be avoided As well as areas that afford protection from the prevailing Northwest winds when transiting the coast.  Implementing such a dual traffic separation scheme, one for larger commercial vessels and one for small Recreational and Commercial vessels, would enhance safety by keeping the smaller vessels out of the path of the larger vessels that sometimes happens in the San Francisco and Los Angeles/Long Beach area. It would also keep the smaller vessels in closer proximity to each other which could enhance safety in the event one of the smaller vessels was in distress.",,,,,,,

These include Blue Whales, Humpback Whales, California Gray Whales, and Fin Whales.  There is a voluntary speed reduction program in place but it is far from effective.  There is an obligation to protect these whales under the Marine Mammal Protection Act.  There have been successful programs to mitigate ship strikes along the Atlantic coast but for some reason these have been slow to be considered on the Pacific coast.  This area is also heavily trafficked by recreational vessels and commercial fishing vessels and there is a serious danger of collision in periods of low visibility.  The lanes transect the Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary, which would seem to indicate the area has been so designated due to special protections being required.  Moving the shipping lanes OUTSIDE the Channel Islands may present one possible solution.  A MANDATORY speed reduction to 10 kts. or less would be another.  We have learned recently that the ships move quickly through this area only to wait month for unloading at the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach.  It seems that we have learned that a short delay due to either moving the lanes or a mandatory speed reduction will have a minor impact on goods reaching their ports compared to what we have been experiencing over the past year.

It is important to look at past data to determine previous events and trends. But were there special interest groups that protected the rights and ability of recreational vessels? These smaller, less represented groups are easily overlooked when compared to commercially operated and commercially represented vessels. How can this PACPARS affect the non-commercial vessel? With safety comes the potential for personal sacrifice, but at the same time, the rights of the smaller vessels need to be protected.",,,,,,,

Thank you for your work in keeping our seas safer for needed vessel activity, and healthier and more productive for everyone's benefit, human and otherwise.

In the course of your study, please take into consideration that healthy whale populations are essential not only to fisheries productivity, but whales have been identified as significant agents for carbon sequestration,  and that keeps atmospheric CO2 as well as ocean acidification minimized. 

The greatest threat to these whales - blue, humpback and fin whales - is ship-strike mortality. So, to ensure robust whale populations in the Pacific coast's California Current Ecosystem, this threat must be reduced and that may be accomplished in the Gulf of the Farallones region by extending the western shipping lane further offshore, past the shelf break, to intercept north-south shipping . Also, if you were to support speed reduction schemes available now, and in future, endorse potential legislation for vessel speed regulations, that combination of actions could significantly increase ocean health as well as benefit specific species at risk.

Thank you for your consideration,

Respectfully,

Please describe. 
Increased OGV traffic density in the nearshore waters of California will undoubtedly increase emissions of ozone precursors impacting the on-shore environment and hindering much needed progress toward meeting health-based federal and California air quality standards.

(3) Are modifications to existing vessel routing measures needed to address hazards and improve traffic efficiency in the study area? If so, please describe. 
The PBWBS partners have proposed expanding the “area to be avoided” (ATBA) west of the California Channel Islands. To the extent this keeps OGV further off-shore, it can reduce the impact of NOx emissions from ships on ozone formation and unhealthful ozone concentrations on-shore. Therefore, VCAPCD supports expanding the ATBA.

(4) What costs and benefits are associated with the measures listed as potential study considerations? What measures do you think are most cost-effective?  
The PBWBS program has demonstrated that OGV owners and operators will slow down for modest incentives, reducing ozone precursor emissions from transiting OGV in a cost-effective manner by reducing the speed of OGV.  Data from the PBWBS program indicate container and RoRo vessels traveled a total of 304,572 nautical miles (nm) in the PBWBS Southern California vessel speed reduction (VSR) zone during the program period from May 15, 2020 through November 15, 2020.  OGV participating in the PBWBS program traveled 151,267 nm at reduced speeds in the VSR zone, resulting in reductions of 3.37 tons of NOx per day.  If all container and RoRo vessels reduced speeds to 10 knots or less in the VSR zone, estimated NOx reductions would be approximately 6.5 tons per day.  If all other OGV such as bulk carriers and tankers also reduced speeds, NOx emissions would be reduced even more.

(5) What impacts, both positive and negative, would changes to existing routing measures or new routing measures have on the study area?  
A speed limit of 10 knots along the California coast, or at minimum, where OGV travel within 50 nm of ozone nonattainment areas, would result in significant emission reduction benefits and corresponding improvements in air quality, positively impacting the health and welfare of the nearby coastal and inland communities. VCAPCD is unaware of any significant negative impacts beyond minor increases in OGV operator costs.  The increased costs must be minor since many companies participating in the PBWBS program decline the modest financial incentives offered.

(6) Where do you transit? Where are your transit routes? What criteria are used in determining your transit routes? 
VCAPCD is a regulatory agency and as such your inquiry regarding where we transit is not applicable to the agency.  The transit routes affecting air quality in Ventura County are all ships accessing the Port of Hueneme, the Santa Barbara Channel Traffic Separation Scheme (TSS), the informal western route accessing the San Pedro Bay port complex, and potentially the southern TSS and precautionary area near the San Pedro Bay ports. To ensure all vessels are covered by speed restrictions, VCAPCD would support a required 10-knot speed limit in all nearshore waters less than 50 nm from shore.

(9) Are there other environmental, cultural, tribal, marine mammal or other impacts which should be considered during this Port Access Route Study? VCAPCD requests the Coast Guard consider regulatory actions to reduce air pollutant emissions from OGV. VCAPCD recommends the Coast Guard consider a speed limit of 10 knots for OGV.  Speed restrictions are technically and economically feasible as demonstrated by the PBWBS incentive program. Photochemical modeling will undoubtedly show the resulting reduction in NOx emissions will advance attainment of the 2015 ozone NAAQS in Ventura County, resulting in positive health benefits for its residents, visitors and the environment.  It is clear that reducing the speed of OGV is the only realistic method of obtaining near-term emissions reductions from this source category that does not necessitate any engine/vessel upgrades, a time- and capital-intensive undertaking.

As a member of the PBWBS partnership, we would be remiss if we did not mention the impact of OGV on endangered whales in the nearshore waters of California and potentially all along the Pacific Coast of North America. Studies indicate slowing large OGV (300 gross registered tons or larger) to 10 knots or less can reduce the risk of lethal ship strikes on endangered blue, fin, and humpback whales that congregate in or near formal and informal shipping lanes. In addition, slower ships create less ocean noise. The Coast Guard should include these considerations in the PARS as well.

(25) What navigational challenges do you foresee with the implementation of BOEM's Wind Energy Areas (WEAs)?

I foresee closures, if not implemented by the leasee, by the USCG around wind farms. Any navigational options will need to incorporate fishing opportunities as well as to not impede local fishing fleets that support our limited North coast economies. 

(26) Do you currently transit through the proposed BOEM WEAs? Please describe.

I regularly transit and/or fish for albacore tuna in these areas as both a day-commercial fishermen providing the highest-quality fresh fish to local markets, and as an operator of a CPFV that takes recreational fisher-persons to these regions in search of tuna. 

(27) Do you think the Coast Guard should create designated fairways, traffic separation schemes for vessels, or exclusion/restricted areas around wind farms?

I am not informed enough to provide input here on the fine details, but the USCG must find options that keep both our recreational fishery and commercial fishery access to the maximum amount of fishing real-estate on these limited fishing grounds. Both fish and SSTs do not know political or navigational lines, we need to maximize the most flexibility possible to continue to harvest these pelagic species off our coastline.

(28) Would you prefer wind farm exclusion/restricted areas where you can navigate anywhere outside of the wind farm, or would you prefer to restrict your navigation inside designated coastwise fairways and traffic separation schemes through the wind farms? Please explain.

Again, the devil is in the details, but our local fishing fleet supports a large proportion of our local economy and must not be overlooked when discussing these details with these planned wind farms. NIMBYs love the idea of offshore wind farms, but offshore is my back yard and where I all make a living. I encourage decisionmakers to do a better job at evolving both the recreational and commercial fishing fleets in these discussions. We love and live off of these waters.

This proposed rule will protect the well-being of all people. Per the Coast Guard’s visual proposal, this implementation is necessary to protect persons and vessels from hazards associated with a high-speed boat race competition in Orange, TX. A boat race competition is an economic activity that will bring unity, profitable business for establishments in the area, and community involvement. To ensure enjoyment, safety precautions must be thought out, effective, and put into action. After reviewing the proposal, insight was gained from the point of view of tourists. Tourism is the largest industry in the world and beaches are the major factor in this tourism market. However, in the activities of beaches’ tourism, some environmental indexes of beaches have significant effects on tourists’ experience, physical health, and even life safety. Based on the aim of providing safe and healthy services for tourists (Zhou, 2016) which will influence their choices for which the boat race will bring out locals and tourists. There are many hazards that individuals must be cautious about when being present around water. Unfortunately, many people are injured or killed along our nation's waters.",,,,,,,

With regards to reducing reoccurring trespass, a bargaining platform should be within a tow distance to the swim. This is a type of impound of the vessel while afloat, in the lesson to administer right of dive safety standards. The Coast Guard and supporting Naval vessel would be able to inquire and swiftly garrison inbound vessels to a barge center for later referral of trespass during non-access for safety parameters; including the total cost of transport and tow through a secure marine junction. In a further effort the fine if given by officiating judge, the cost will be further to the tieing of a vessel to a barge while in bay or coastline sight, foregoing the right to dock at peir. A fundamental comparison is towing a vehicle during the Boston marathon to a discrete location other than the normal police compound lot for further investigation of trespass with no probable trigger of demonstration. The holders would maintain all rights of trespass and would be in full await of trial past the correspondence of leisure activity by participating in sustained endangerment to known limited waders.",,,,,,,

To: Coast Guard 
Date : 10/13/21
Subject :USCG-2021-0582

I agree with the temporary special local regulation for the RWO Offshore World Championship on November 10, 12 and 14, 2021. This regulation will serve to prevent any accident, or possible hazards to the public and participating members of the championship. These areas represent danger as boats will be speeding and not necessarily anticipating any unforeseeable. Moreover, this regulation is temporary so people will be able to return to their businesses and regular activities in a reasonable amount of time. This will also help prevent any lawsuit or damages that the Coast Guard will be liable for in the event that an accident was to occur.  

My only concern would be small entities that are planning to use this event as an opportunity to make money, increase clientele and network. That group of people may see this regulation as a hinderance to their activities and therefore may not see the purpose of it. However, these regulated areas will only be closed for 7 hours a day during a 3 days period. Additionally, they are able to seek permission from the captain to access these areas if anything urgent comes up during the competition. Overall, this regulation is not expected to cause much of an economic impact and it is meant to prevent accidents and ensure safety.  ",,,,,,,

From my readings on the RWO's website for this championship, that 200 number seems low and could be much higher. I support this proposed rule by the Coast Guard.",,,,,,,

Their status of “threatened” went down from “endangered” due to an increase in population in 2017. If the Captain of the Port Key West is concerned with the danger of high-speed vessels for participants, participant vessels, and the general public, then who is responsible for being concerned for the marine life who will be experiencing three 7 hour days of high-speed boat racing? In 2016, it was reported that more than 100 manatee deaths occurred in Florida, many by cigarette-style speed boats like the ones to be used in the race. The current rule does not propose how wildlife will be protected. How is it ensured that the manatees are going to be protected by the rights outlined in the Endangered Species Act, which says “it is illegal to feed, harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, annoy, or molest manatees”. Because of these legal protections, it is irresponsible to not mention specific actions taken to monitor if manatees are being annoyed, fed, harassed, wounded, or killed during such a large event where it is possible for any of these illegal activities to take place. If it is dangerous for other boats to be in the water, there must also be concern for the species that live in said water. The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission is the agency charged with documenting manatee deaths. Will the agency be there to make sure that they are accounting for all manatee deaths for the event, and how will the event be held accountable for such deaths? It is irresponsible to not account for the harm manatees could see from this event, and it is important to account for deaths that could lead to another status change from ""threatened"" to ""endangered"" if more manatees are dying as it will increase protections needed for the species. I believe that there must be measures in place to account for how manatees are injured during the race. Although in the rule it is insinuated that a 3 day period of racing is a short amount of time, it is also 3 7 hour days of disturbing wildlife habitats with no mention of how they could potentially be harmed or how harm will be accounted for. Therefore, it should be noted in the rule that there could be potential for environmental harm of species, especially the West Indian Manatee that has legal protections in place. ",,,,,,,

A variety of things can result in a complete loss of propulsion power and therefore the vessel is virtually helpless and in a narrow channel there is no time to anchor or get the vessel under control before it has grounded or had an allusion or collision. Bad sensors (most common), low oil pressure, or more seriously, fire cause total shut down, and if the problem is minor, it still can take several minutes to reset alarms and shutdowns to power up the vessel. all of these scenarios eliminate the skills and experience of the marine professionals in both the pilot house and engine room to try to ""nurse"" the vessel to a safer area where the problems can be addressed whether it is an anchorage, dockside, or a controlled grounding in a soft bank. I find it ironic that on some of the tugs i have worked on, the auto shut down eliminates the main firefighting system because fire pump is powered by a power takeoff on one of the main engines. The harsh reality is that it sometimes is better to knowingly chance destroying a multi-thousand dollar engine to avoid an ecological disaster. The auto shut down eliminates human judgement and i believe that it constitutes a real threat to the environment and public safety.

The launching of rockets and other space-bound vessels produces a good amount of both pollutants and physical parts which pose a danger to land and sea vehicles that happen to be in the flight path of these rockets. It is due to these potentially harmful effects that I agree that the proposed change to the existing safety zone around Cape Canaveral, Florida should occur. An update to this safety zone is crucial, as the types and sizes of launch vehicles are also rapidly changing. ",,,,,,,

Since 2009 we have had several additional outside companies that have entered into the aerospace realm with advances that increase the likelihood of additional launches in the future from this area. In this short period of time launches have already doubled. With potential for space tourists and other veins of this potential business model. The number of launches in this area could rise even more in the future, and that isn't including any plans for defense or the international space station launches that are already in planning. That being said, the rules surrounding the encompassing area should be re-evaluated as this proposal suggests. There is also a higher likelihood of increased marine traffic in the area to view launches as well as tourists who are not use to some of these regulations due to the nature of Florida and their tourist population. Doing nothing at this point is not an option and the proposed RNA would help in assisting with the reduction of other factors coming into play and the safety of those involved.",,,,,,,

     I am a former crew member (2016-2017) of one of the National Security Cutters (NSC) that was homeported in Charleston, SC. I know you stated that OPCs would replace the current MECs; which, are homeported in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Gulf of Mexico. While I was in Charleston, it was rumored they would refurbish the only Navy piers, in order to make room for the growing fleet. It was also rumored that Charleston will become the new ""Super Hub"" for a variety of Coast Guard Cutters. Was the dreading that began taking place, while I was stationed there, for the anticipation of the growing Cutter traffic? Do you plan on Homeporting a majority of OPCs there, once the piers are deemed safe? There is a lot of growth and potential in that area and I would be happy to see it put to use, for the greater of the fleet. 

Proud to have served,
Medically Retired,

With achievements growing greater by neighboring countries in Coast Guard remedies to endangered port activities, the United States Cutter program has met the success record and revival of modern surveillance activities. The over object has been with drug smuggling, illegal entry into the States, and breeches in submarine warfare. There is a judicial burden that has plagued the Coast Guards fleet of cutters, the reasonable cost of disposing and tracking individuals with non-monetary return value. To keep with the lowering patrol effort for individual craft, the recommendation is to begin a fast service program to identify risk hull behaviors and attributes, this being to implement a program that would pinout damaged hulls from beam and keel lengths of the vessel. Of such would substantiate the remainder of the previous fleet ordinances, to give a subject of training and administration of before peer arrival/departure permission slips and levies. In statement, there is a cost and overburden in environmental surveillance activities that the Coast Guard and Navy already attest to in its own fleet and ranks. To push the requirements on arriving venture in the cargo and shipping lane business while being non-compromising with passenger vessels that have consistent non-shutdown operations due to stress hull fracturing and lack the direct remediation to fix/enter shipyard correspondences offered by both international maritime and United States Maritimes requirements. Not to create unpayable debts, but to give legal and substantial income to a paid aging fleet looking for end-of-life purpose without the heavy and sometimes critical work positions that may risk Sailors and Guardsmen at sea or in port. In moving forward with new technology and development, more non-lethal means of equipment should be projected into the new and base platforms still available, being in items such as active sonar thickness testing, low field radar, air/water-quality assurance testing and UV/infrared imaging specialties- moving toward investigation non-intrusion. Meeting the levies with impact statements holds marginal value when presenting for cause, the version of pollution seen with data stands in court when retrial for garnishment of port fines. It would be an equivalent of meeting G20 and Paris agreements at a Capital Market often seized in older and less maintained vessels that require more service tugs and fuel supply to ensure safe operations, with waivers being established due to grandfather clauses or parchment of year built(newer vessels may have unseen damage with no fines applied). Waivers need to be reassessed and with a request for increased share cost by level of stewardship applied. Give opportunity to reduce in port standbys to vessels that meet and exceed clearance surveillance and keep a streamlined access for those in the latter.",,,,,,,

Please find attached an important comment I have prepared for your meeting regarding ""Sexual Harassment and Sexual Assault—Prevention and Culture Change in the Merchant Marine.""

This document, which I authored, is titled, ""An Epic Sexual Assault Scandal, 30 Years in the Making, is Coming for the U.S. Coast Guard. This FOIA Request is only the Beginning."" 

It contains important information regarding the failure of the U.S. Coast Guard to enforce the shipboard sexual assault allegation reporting law (46 USC10104) over the past 31 years, and the devastating effect that failure has had on mariners in the U.S. maritime industry. 

Thank you for your consideration of this public comments.

As a Mariner the only time I have had a case of harassment or abuse addressed in a professional and productive manner was when I called the Coast Guard (CG). I was lucky to know someone who could give me the contact information I needed, I was lucky that the CG gentleman with whom I was put in contact was respectful, understanding and responsible. 

The authority to deal with harassment and assault would best be handled by the Coast Guard, so that they can provide oversight, ensuring that predators aren't protected by their friends/vessel/company or union. There is nothing stopping sailors from jumping from ship to ship- it doesn’t look bad on our work history, it’s to be expected. Sailors can switch unions and companies. The Coast Guard is the only big picture oversight that I can see. 

I would feel safer if predators had to report to the vessels master that they had been found guilty of harassment and or assault in the past. These actions, from what I have witnessed over the years, are hardly ever a one time incident, they are actions that individuals have gotten away with time and time again, and they have increased in aggressiveness over time. 
If my master knew that people had a past, I hope that they won’t tell me I’m “making too much work” for them by raising concerns for my safety. 
If there could be a checks and balances system to ensure that vessels, companies and unions are handling concerns appropriately, I think it could make a difference.
If there was a way to make such information available to all personnel it would allow people to feel more secure.

I believe another step would be for the CG to set the precedent that harassment and assault cases will be taken seriously, that personnel will face strict consequences when they choose to be inappropriate or create a hostile and/or dangerous work environment.

Last but not least, I have only tried to use the CG reporting system once, but the app was inadequate. Without someone directly giving me the contact information I needed, I would not have been able to  get in contact with the CG. I think this needs to be revised. I had been on my last vessel for four hours when my 1st A/E started touching me. Four hours. He had been assaulting another young woman for months before I arrived. I had been on ships for six years at that point and didn’t know I could go to the CG, so I went to my medical department representative, my master, my DPA and after retaliation for speaking up and inaction, I vented to a friend who was able to direct me to the proper CG person. 

I understand this would be a big undertaking for the CG, but I would like you to know that I am often the youngest person on my vessels by 10-20 years. I have never been on a rotation on a vessel where at least one person wasn’t inappropriate with me. Living on a vessel and being unable to escape these situations makes them all the more intense and frightening. The behavior in the Merchant industry is far from appropriate, let alone professional. Many personnel  onboard have limited means to communicate, especially when the vessel is not near enough to land for cell signal. ",,,,,,,

I am a female alumni of Great Lakes Maritime Academy, and am actively sailing on my Engineering License. I am currently taking cadets of my own. I want you to know how disappointed I am in the decisions being made regarding the Midshipman X case. 

By ending the Sea Year at USMMA, you told this industry ""Rapists, you can keep your job. Cadets, not so much"" and then you wonder why this toxic environment prevails. You breed future predators and encourage existing ones by punishing cadets trying to get real world experience while letting policies like 46 US Code 10104 remain in place. There is a greater punishment for a failure to report an oily discharge than there is for a sexual assault. This leads to SASH constantly being swept under the rug - by Masters, by shipping companies, by labor unions, and by Maritime Academies. 

From my own experience, Admiral Achenbach of GLMA brags that this is solely a USMMA problem, because while they too have these cases ""GLMA cadets prefer to keep these issues private"". Do you ever ask yourself why that is? Do you ask if you foster an environment that shames victims? Do you willingly share details of a case with another student's parents in the locker room of your gym? Do you bully cadets into not ruining a relationship with a shipping company to avoid a loss of cadet berths? Do you hold a pizza party afterwards and claim that sexual assault is solved? 

Even if a cadet wasn't being coerced into silence, what is your protocol? Do you continue to send cadets to the same ship without alerting them that there have been reports? Do you follow up with the Master? Do you leave a paper trail with their union or their company? How many documented instances of SASH is required for a company or union to take action? When does it escalate to USCG or criminal proceedings? 

I've only worked on one ship that had a rape kit on board. Who is supposed to administer it? How is the DNA supposed to be preserved? Does the cadet have to be violated a second time by an untrained professional trying to collect evidence?Companies commonly keep a drug test administrator on standby in case of an accident, why can't they employ a SANE as well? 

These are the questions that will lead to a solution. Not sticking cadets on school training ships with 60 of their friends so they gain no knowledge of the lifestyle that is to come with the maritime industry, much less the practical and occupational knowledge. This industry whines that there aren't enough new mariners to keep a healthy force, but then they fail to protect and defend cadets against the real enemies - rapists.  ",,,,,,,

Kennedy Senior, United States Maritime Commissioner, said “You can have a Merchant Marine with first class men even if they sail second class ships, but second-class men can't be trusted with the finest ships afloat.""
It is times like these when I reflect upon that phrase and my experience as an Officer of the United States Merchant Marine. After years of reflection, I have finally started to see things as they truly are in shades of grey vs. black and white where the abused become the abusers and the cycle continues. Prison with a chance of drowning some call it. 
My name is Christina Colarusso, and I am originally from Middleboro and currently from Vineyard Haven Massachusetts. I am a 2012 Graduate of Massachusetts Maritime Academy with a Bachelor of Science in Marine Engineering. I currently hold a 2nd Assistant Engineer Unlimited Horsepower License with the United States Coast Guard among various other billets. I have been landside for the last five years due the physical and psychological abuse I was subject to at sea and in multiple male dominated fields, areas, and professions. 
I would return to sea if you could ensure my safety and believe a safety shutdown of commercial shipping is not the answer.
One single sentence, one single touch, one single word can change the way a mariner may treat you forever. In the merchant marine there sometimes is no room for second chances. What can be said about the machinery and safety at sea, can also be said about surviving the environment. Of all the horrendous and egregious things that happened to me at sea the worst was that I became a prison of my own mind and was suicidal due to the constant mind games. A girl who worked hundreds of extra maintenance hours on the training ship to ensure she knew the place inside and out top to bottom more than anyone so no one could say she didn’t earn her spot, barely made it halfway across the Atlantic on her first solo fresh ink on the diploma ship assignment before contemplating jumping overboard. If it was not for the satellite phone and the ability to call my father, I would not be writing you this letter today and I still spent five more years in the industry after that experience.
For all the things that happened to me at school or at sea or later in life in all the other male dominated professions a maritime grad might find herself in, I am thankful. Thankful because it has made the women and men that have been subject to this special old timey sort of abuse the most resilient and compassion leaders I have ever met. I think of my classmates’ stories and all that they have overcome and am proud to be a merchant mariner and I say “Go Bucs” with Pride. We were all doing the best we could with our current level of awareness at the time, let’s turn the page and let it go to release it forever. 
Please do not punish the current students for a failed system, think Catholic Church where corporations actively choose to move super predators around, and everything is kept hush hush. 
Do not vilify a complete industry before talking to us and hearing the steps needed to be taken and how we know we can ensure you get it right this time. 
Ships need accountability and data collection; Masters and Chiefs need assistance with the paperwork so that they can get back to what they love the ocean and the engines. Everyone loves a hero, instead of a scenario where you throw an already hurting industry off track by derailing all current students career timelines, why not throw a lifeline by offering a better way for communicating unsafe conditions and maybe even extractions from unsafe conditions internationally if it is dangerous enough. I could thank everyone for the good and the bad because it made me the strong woman I am today that has twenty contingency plans and loves a great puzzle and getting the team back on track welfare wise. 
If the fine for me spilling one drop of oil is $1,000,000 but the fine for a Captain not reporting a sexual assault to the Coast Guard is only $5,000, how can you say you care about us or our wellbeing? I often think of the tragedy of the El Faro, What was the lesson learned for such a horrific loss to the industry? I believe it taught us this “If bucking the chain of command saves a single life it is worth the risk.”
My generation will not settle for the systems of the past they do not serve us. We do not have all the answers but together we can come up with good long-term solutions if you have the right people at the table. When the alarm bell tolls, you may have to fight a fire alongside someone who two seconds ago was your enemy, but when the alarm bell tolls you must remember the best survival phrase of all. “Shipmates Before Brothers, Brothers Before Others.” What that means is, come Hell or High Water we are getting to the lifeboat but only if we do it together. #MariTimesUp # NewCleanWaterAct

The route is normally open for commercial traffic, to include large container ships.  The vessels that participate in the parade are much smaller, a few as small as 17 feet.  About 5 years ago, it was reported that there was a near miss with a container ship and some vessels participating in the parade.  A collision with a container ship at night would have been catastrophic.  The proposed rule has been requested by parade organizers in an effort to ensure the safety of the vessels and occupants.  The negative impact or potential inconvenience of the rule to other interested parties is minimal, mainly because of the limited area affected and the short timeframe the rule is in force, 2.5 hours.  The potential of this rule to save lives far outweighs any potential inconveniences that may be born from its enactment.  The proposed rule speaks directly to the purpose of the rulemaking authority that the Coast Guard has been given, and for all of these reasons I offer my support for the rule.  ",,,,,,,

I believe this rule is fair and promotes the safety of the racers and non-participating craft. The research done to ensure the protection of small businesses, the environment, and Native American interests is exemplary and demonstrates no real reason to protest the race being conducted. I also believe including ""from the surface to bottom"" when defining the dimensions of the prohibited area is important in case someone decided they could get out of the rule simply by owning a submarine or semi-submersible and traversing beneath the area.",,,,,,,

I find this an interesting proposal, but what is the reasoning behind the specified 400 and 500 yard radiuses of the two safety zones? I am assuming that those radiuses were set with a certain major subset of fireworks in mind. Does that mean that the types of fireworks permitted for these safety zones have to be restricted as well? Also, I understand that it complies with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969's section on the human environment, but how does the affect the marine environment? It sounds like it is encouraging unwarranted potential chemical and left behind trash in the area by those fireworks. And with that idea, were these areas selected designated for firework displays prior to this rule or are they to be designated as such as a result of this rule?",,,,,,,
