Regarding Agenda Items (6) (b) National Recreational Boating Strategic Plan and (11) Boating Safety Related Topics
To wit:
The safety of recreational boaters on the navigable waters of the United States is being jeopardized by the boaters' lack of access to up to date navigational charting information due to the current standard of care being exhibited by the manufacturers of recreational electronic chart display information systems. The electronic charts and associated subscription update services being offered by the manufacturers are navigationally unsafe due to being generally significantly out of date, at some manufacturers by more than one year, and the displayed charts do not provide boaters any traceability to the USCG issued weekly Local Notices to Mariners that have been incorporated.
The worldwide IMO/IHO led transition to Electronic Navigation Charting in support of SOLAS and GMDSS treaty obligations is well underway and effectively supporting the safety needs of the participating large commercial ship mariners. The United States' own National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has been leading the way in architecting a successful transition from traditional paper charts to electronic navigation charts in collaboration with its mission partners. Today, NOAA and the USCG provide ENC and LNM charting updates on a weekly cycle. 
The electronic charting update infrastructure exists throughout the worldwide commercial maritime industry and is supported by the commercial manufactures of the GMDSS / ECDIS equipment. These participants access and utilize weekly updates to maritime charting information. Indeed they are mandated to utilize this update process and frequency. This weekly update process is the established international standard for ensuring the carriage of most recent navigation planning charts.
The manufactures of recreational electronic chart plotters and multi-function displays advertise that they provide boaters access to the latest charts via internet subscriptions and one-time memory card updates. The fact of it is that none of the manufacturers comes anywhere close to providing ""the most recent charts"". The ones that I am personally familiar with and those of my boating associates, is that the updates are generally six months to several years out of date. And even more jeopardizing to boater safety, none of the major manufacturers enables traceability of the viewed chart segment to the USCG LNMs that are incorporated. 
The data and infrastructure is available to rectify this safety shortfall. NOAA / USCG provide it now to the GMDSS / ECDIS manufacturers and mariners on a weekly update basis. Not one single recreational navigational display manufacturer provides a recreational version of this weekly update service, at any price to recreational boaters. (To my knowledge)
For the purpose of establishing minimum safety thresholds, governing bodies and governments routinely establish minimum system requirements and manufacturing regulations. With the sunsetting of paper RNCs and the transition to ENCs and electronic displays, the old method of writing LNM updates on paper charts needs to be transitioned into its equivalent for electronic displays. The most likely method for this transition is to utilize the currently available weekly ENC update infrastructure.
The SOLAS participants define navigationally safe chart update frequency to be weekly. 
(1) I ask the Committee to adopt the SOLAS definition for navigationally safe chart updates as the standard for recreational boating safety. And thus incorporate into the 2022 – 2027 Plan an Opportunities and Challenges - Technologies strategy. This strategy to evolve the recreational boating electronic manufactures' culture toward a practice of weekly ENC chart update availability for equipment owners. Also within the Plan  promulgate associated Performance Initiatives. 
The recreational marine electronics industry has not, and is not addressing the described critical navigation data recentcy gap.
 (2) I am requesting this Committee, through its powers, cause a remedy to be enacted through appropriate actions being incorporated into the National Recreational Boating Strategic Plan, agenda item (6) (b) and by all other means at the Committee's disposal.

The RBS Program includes Technologies as the second of its four Challenges & Opportunities. 

An additional Technology C & O for the RBS Program is evident: Improve education and training of recreational electronic navigation displays and improve boater access to up-to-date ENC data ensuring that the displayed charts are navigationally safe.   


I trust that the foregoing comment will be useful to the Committee as it reviews and evaluates the 2022 -2027 RBS Strategic Plan and discusses boating safety related topics.

The project includes widening the turning basin to protect the levee of damage from future floods. This is very important due to the anthropogenically accelerated climate change that is currently occurring. There is ample evidence that the global climate is changing too quickly to be natural - increased global temperatures, rising sea levels, increased extreme events, and more. 

Various regions of the world are being affected differently, and it has been observed that the East Coast of the United States is suffering mostly from sea level rise and increased extreme events, including hurricanes and flooding. Since the late 1800s, sea levels have risen 8 inches and continue to rise at an increasing rate. The higher the level rises, the greater the risk of inundation in coastal cities, which could be worse and last longer than what it would have been at the normal sea level. Since Port Arthur, Texas, is right on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico, it is at great risk for future inundations at unprecedented levels. If it has been assessed that the Taylor Bayou Turning Point levee requires improvements to protect from future damage, the proposed rule to extend the safety zone should be approved. 

While the proposed rule does have great benefits, it also poses a burden on the city’s residents. The bridge where construction will take place has to be officially closed temporarily to allow construction to proceed more efficiently. The Beaumont Enterprise, a local news source, reported in May of this year that the project will also be adding a temporary bridge along Texas 124, with only two lanes, one going in each direction. While small, it offers another option to the bridge further South. It adds on $140,000 to the project, which was already estimated at $500,000. The addition should lessen the burden for local citizens. 

The lives of the residents should be prioritized over the inconvenience the project causes until it is completed, and the temporary bridge addition lessens the burden. However, the temporary bridge and the acceptance for the extended time of the temporary safety zone should be seen as just that, temporary, by those involved with the construction. A timely schedule should be imposed and maintained for the benefit of all parties impacted.

Ok, we'll go that route, it make sense, especially since we already use ABS for our Load Line & Class equipment.  So, boom, get moving with the TPO option, paying ABS for their oversight, but then BAM, USCG Fees on top of everything!?!?!  But some times the USCG doesn't even put boots on deck to hand over the COI, why are we getting charged?  Oh, and when they do show up, we're providing them a Training Platform for new Inspection Officers.  So why are we getting charged a big fee, when we provide the classroom and time away from possible jobs to have USCG personnel roam around our vessel for 4-6 hours training?  I had one COI ""drop off"" visit form USCG personnel in an East Coast port last almost 8 hours!!!!  That's lost revenue from potential barge moves we could have done in that port, but we had to say no to those customers!  USCG this was your push, you couldn't handle 6000 new vessels.  A $70 reduction for TPO Option companies is not helping and the NPRM breakdown of the USCG time is not accurate.

The letter is thoughtful, enlightening and addresses some flawed assumptions.  Third Party Organizations, regulated companies, and service industries that support them have taken-on a significant burden to successfully launch the Coast Guard's TSMS option for auditing and surveying towing vessels.  With the assistance of the Towing Vessel National Center of Expertise (TV NCOE), this new program advances towing safety with expert third party entities while unburdening government to a large degree.  Centralizing oversight of TSMS vessel audits and surveys at the TV NCOE could further unburden multiple levels of Coast Guard personnel (Area, Districts, Sectors).

Over the last few years, however, the hunting, fishing and birding subsistence activities in the Bering and Chukchi Seas have been repeatedly threatened by mineral development and the encroachment of vessel traffic.  The village councils through their community-based planning processes have identified the protection of their hunting, fishing and birding in the Bering and Chukchi Sea areas as a top priority for the villages.

On behalf of the undersigned conservation organizations, we wish to submit additional recommendations to the Port Access Route Study for the Alaskan Arctic Coast (Arctic PARS). These comments are intended to amend and adapt those we have already submitted to the above-referenced docket.
The Bering PARS, finalized in 2017, along with decisions made by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) in 2018, substantially improved navigation safety in the Bering Strait region.   Nevertheless, we believe the area surrounding Little Diomede Island and Fairway Rock is in need of additional measures to improve navigational safety, prevent oil spills, and protect important wildlife migratory routes and habitat.  The focus of these supplemental comments is therefore the importance of moving forward promptly with an “area to be avoided” (ATBA) designation around Little Diomede Island and Fairway Rock.

Please see attached files for additional information",,,,,,"https://downloads.regulations.gov/USCG-2018-1058-0046/attachment_1.pdf,https://downloads.regulations.gov/USCG-2018-1058-0046/attachment_4.pdf,https://downloads.regulations.gov/USCG-2018-1058-0046/attachment_2.pdf,https://downloads.regulations.gov/USCG-2018-1058-0046/attachment_5.pdf,https://downloads.regulations.gov/USCG-2018-1058-0046/attachment_3.pdf",

The Marine Chart Division of NOAA's Office of Coast Survey is responsible for charting U.S. coastal waters and certain inland waterways. This division depicts anchorage areas on NOAA Electronic Navigational Charts (ENCs) where they intersect navigable waterways.

I have served as a nautical cartographer within the Nautical Data Branch, Marine Chart Division, Office of Coast Survey since May 2016. I have experience evaluating boundaries and regulations for Federal Register proposed and final rulemakings as they relate to nautical charting.

The primary purpose of this comment submission is to recommend revising paragraphs (a)(19) and (a)(20) of § 110.157 to read as follows:

(19) Anchorage C—Cape Henlopen. All waters bound by the following points:

(20) Anchorage D—Indian River. All waters bound by the following points:

This revision eliminates confusion that could potentially otherwise be introduced during geospatial applications. I also recommend preserving the geodetic references (i.e. NAD 83) for both tables in the Final Rulemaking.

I noticed that Anchorage D—Indian River encompasses a dangerous submerged wreck depicted on NOAA ENC US4DE11M at 74 50'32.463""W, 38 30'31.788""N (WGS 1984). This report is intended to be used solely for situational awareness purposes, and I defer to Coast Guard officials to determine any adverse effects that could potentially be caused by establishing this anchorage ground.

Respectfully,
Nicholas Szelak, Cartographer

The Marine Chart Division of NOAA's Office of Coast Survey is responsible for charting U.S. coastal waters and certain inland waterways. In keeping with that responsibility, the division depicts the locations of anchorage areas where they intersect navigable waterways as shown on NOAA ENCs - Electronic Navigational Charts.

I am a nautical cartographer; member since December 2004 of the Nautical Data Branch / Marine Chart Division / Office of Coast Survey.  I have extensive experience in examining boundaries and regulations associated with Federal Register proposed and final rules as they relate to nautical charting.

The purpose of my comments is to recommend a revision of the sentences that precede TABLE 1 TO PARAGRAPH (a)(1) and TABLE 2 TO PARAGRAPH (a)(2) on Federal Register Page 17049, Column 2.

Revise 110.170 (a)(1) from “(1) Anchorage A. The waters bound by a line connecting the following points:” to “(1) Anchorage A. The corner coordinates of the anchorage follow:”

Revise 110.170 (a)(2) from “(2) Anchorage B. Explosives anchorage. The waters bound by a line connecting the following points:” to “(2) Anchorage B. Explosives anchorage. The corner coordinates of the anchorage follow:”

Please retain the reference to World Geodetic System (WGS 84) in the Final Rule.

Although I have previous experience with examining these proposed boundaries, and I understand that the intent is for each boundary to be a quadrilateral, it would be ideal for the boundaries of the anchorages to be described as accurately as possible for the benefit of other Marine Chart Division cartographers and other stakeholders.

Best Regards,

Lance Roddy, Cartographer

Quite some distance to transit to/from the Geo-political front for strategic competition where nations compete for arctic resources.   Seattle also is crime ridden, with high taxes, including a giant tax even on on soft drinks, ordinances that welcome criminals to Seattle, graffiti ridden, occupied by street vagrants cheered on by politicians.  Houses cost $850K to $1.5M... is this where you want an uptick of civilian and uniformed personnel to seek a place to live?   The PEIS itself recognizes many now flee to the Everett area to escape Seattle prices, taxes, open air drug dealing, street prostitution, free needle programs, lawlessness.   It seems obvious... put some of these new vessels in any of the following:  Everett, Bellingham, Port Angeles, Seward, Kodiak, all with capable marine services, lower cost of living, commute routes that are not congested.   A significant part of the PEIS is revealed in a word search and count for the word Parking.   This word appears around 150 times, 100 more than Ship or Vessel... just in volume 1.   The significance of parking in the PEIS is revealed with a remark saying 'less than 50% of the expanded site will be dedicated to parking'.  Wow, is this what waterfront industrial land at the mouth of a salmon bearing river is to be used for... 49% of the expansion for parking cars?   In Port Angeles, there is land across the street from the wharf/pier to park at... and the employees can afford to buy or rent within walking distance.  There is also mention of relocating 197 employees the great distance of 0.4 miles from the HM Jackson building.. to new digs along the river bank.   Why not leave these 197 where they are.  Over at PSNS & IMF employees  in building 850 face a longer walk to get to Drydock 6.. than the walk from HM Jackson building to the Coast Guard Base.   Why not leave these employees where they are...?  It is the least impact, lowest cost.   Right out of the shoot this PEIS is self-sertifying with a giant blind spot, because it did not look at the obvious options of locating some, maybe most of the new ships in other ports, and ports closer to the site of operations.  Pier 30 and Pier 46 are in proximity of BNSF rail lines, Interstate 5, giant warehouse facilities.. you can't move these!   However you can move ships, they are built to be mobile.. having rudders, propulsion, navigation systems, highly trained crew, move the ships, they are built for it.  Moving rail lines.. nope... Moving I5  nope... Moving Sea-Tac airport  nope.  There is no viable 'mitigation' for the longshore industry which is vital to the national economy.   As for environmental and risk matters.. while the longshore industry must rely on deep water ports with connectivity, and T30 and T46 already serve this purpose, this industry does not have the option of seeking a less environmentally sensitive, less risky location.. so the longshore industry must live with these risks and consequences.  The USCG on the other hand can pick locations not under the Seattle Fault... and not at a salmon bearing river mouth, and not in the path of predicted 80 mile per hour mud slides from Mt. Rainier.  The USCG should seek safer ground away from the Duwamish river.. it just makes sense.   ",,,,,,,

2) The traffic light at the intersection of Alaskan Way S and S Atlantic St. (entrance to Pier 46), should be coordinated with the train signal. The traffic light should not signal green to turn (or proceed from Terminal 46) east onto S Atlantic while the train signal is active and the barrier down due to a crossing train. 
3) The Elliot Bay Trail should be extended south along the CG Base Seattle frontage to provide protected bicycle path to the entrance and/or beyond. 
3a) The northbound unprotected bicycle lane on Alaskan Way S is crossed by the right vehicle turn lane to S Atlantic St. Because of the volume of commercial truck traffic making this turn, the bicycle lane should be protected. 
4) Could a bus stop be added on Alaskan Way near the entrance to CG Base Seattle?
5) If the CG acquires portion(s) of Terminal 46, will the Terminal 46 truck entrance be moved? If so, to where?",,,,,,,

(1)  Marine Terminals like T46 are of strategic military significance to DoD, for example DoD and the US Army have identified 23 Strategic Sea Ports, including the Port of Tacoma, where in time of war commercial operations at Tacoma Terminals will suspend in favor of Military uses, those commercial operations must transfer to other Terminals, such at T46 in Seattle.   Expansion plans that take away marine terminals should consider the strategic military readiness impacts.   If not addressed in the PEIS, where will this be addressed?
(2) The PEIS states modernization of Base Seattle is ""independent"" of three other ongoing PEIS processes for ship acquisition, and operational plans.. perhaps even home port selections.   This ""independent"" approach seems inferior to taking a 'dependent' approach where shore facilities, ships, and missions are fully integrated and optimized.   As a minimum home port selections should be a dependent part of this analysis.  With that view such things as determining where Drydockings of PSC ships can occur would be appropriate to include.. then a critical attribute of a Strategic Planning Process might include adequate drydocking capacity within the home port commuting area.  Were this a critical attribute Seattle would be found lacking (unless VIGOR gets a larger drydock), but Portland and Alameda would be found sufficient. There are financial consequences to this (TDY costs) as well as guardsman family quality of life burden... return from duty to find, you're going to Portland or Mare Island leaving your family in Seattle.  
(3)  Consider adding an Economist to the PEIS team.   The socioeconomic analysis is complex enough to warrant specialized credentials.  As presented in the PEIS there seems to be an assumption of dollar equivalence.. a dollar collected in tax, and paid out in wages is equivalent to a dollar paid from international trade that ripples and multiplies along the supply and production lines.. in the USA and with trading partners... the common term is more bang for a buck, but an Economist should be tasked with quantifying this phenomenon and using the proper term.
(4)  GHG emissions analysis seem to overlook:  container ship fuel burn driving past Seattle to Tacoma... distance fuel burn for street semi drivers going farther to reach rail heads (T46 and T30 are very close to BNSF).. congestion fuel burn on marine terminals T18, T5 due to increased semi truck congestion.  The PMA and Longshore union could estimate these changes with accuracy.
(5) The PEIS mentions a Strategic Planning Process occurred.. resulting in screening criteria.. that further resulted in excluding all options besides modernizing and expanding Base Seattle.   This process and it's resulting screening criteria should be made public.  See PEIS paragraph 2.6.
(6) The EIS process seems to drive an evaluation that misses no minute environmental or cultural detail... the trouble with this is exclusion of gigantic Capstone level factors and impacts... for instance mass migration happens.. see Library of Congress documents and history of 1930s Dust Bowl Drought migration to California.   Today.. a reasonable person would predict drought driven migration to WA and OR from California.... eliminating marine terminals where population will rise misses a chance to show foresight.
(7)  The 2018 USCG Strategy includes INCREASING MARITIME COMMERCE.. with this sentence ""The prosperity of our Nation is inextricably linked to a safe and efficient Maritime Transportation System.""   In this spirit it is hoped the USCG seek congressional tasking to include No Loss to the Marine Transportation System in it's tasking, and include the Port of Seattle, ILWU, PMA and other supply chain stake holders on the planning team.
(8) Changes in work practices, such as work from home, and other factors seem to leave the 35 acre EXPEDIA campus on Elliot bay.. adjacent to T86 Grain Terminal... under-utilized.   EXPEDIA is not a water dependent business, which could relocate to excess commercial vacancy in Downtown Seattle that has a vacancy rate of 11%. PEIS section 5 should include loss of Marine Terminals as significant irrevocable harm.. if the current path is followed.. however if EXPEDIA moved to an office tower making way for the USCG.. there is no impact to include in PEIS section 5.
(9) As mentioned at the Seattle meeting...  Consult with WSDOT on fencing off and creating USCG parking below raised parts of SR 99, right across the street from Base Seattle, this area is currently under-utilized, and could support much of USCG parking requirements.

I am an Air Force ROTC cadet who is currently taking the national security portion of his academic ROTC class. Throughout the lecture, we have discussed the importance of funding when it comes to maintaining infrastructure. In the case of Base Seattle, much of the infrastructure is outdated and is a hindrance to the Coastguardsmen completing their mission. I am aware Base Seattle has an area of responsibility that extends into the regions of the Arctic Circle and the Pacific Northwest. Adversaries such as Russia (who is around 60 miles away from Alaska) and China are trans-Pacific threats to our national security. Tensions between the US and Russia are building, thus the importance of maintaining a presence in the region increases by the day. The National Defense Strategy (2022) even emphasizes the need to strengthen deterrence against China. However, I believe there has to be a balance between following national security objectives and the priorities commercial shipping companies have set for themselves. 

According to the official Port of Seattle Website, around 3.7 million Twenty-foot Equivalent Units (TEUs, measured 20ft-8ft) come through the Northwest Shipping Alliance (Ports of Tacoma and Seattle combined) (Swift 2019.) Utilizing portions of Terminals 46 and 30 will cut into the revenues of shipping companies and the ships will have less space to be moored. Civilians working at this port also run the risk of losing their jobs and recreational parks may be torn up for construction space. Sacrificing some people’s job for the sake of national security should not always happen, especially if other military installations can be utilized. Perhaps you should consider talking with the US Navy about moving some assets to Naval Station Everett, along with modernizing the existing infrastructure already on Base Seattle Property.

With Regards, 
Gabe Maxwell

Container terminal Infrastructure at terminal 46 and 30 is imperative to the working waterfront. These terminals can not afford to lose any acreage or they will be obsolete.  This terminals provide many jobs to the Seattle area. The close proximity to the rail is hard to come by and imperative for container operations. 
The coast guard can set up shop anywhere on the puget sound. Why get rid of the infrastructure in place when the coast guard should probably be further up north anyways to be closer to where they are needed.
Please do not let the coast guard infringe on our working waterfront.  Thank you

Add your comment here

Let me start off by saying the CG can find a different spot..C.G. can set up anywhere, Everett would be a better choice it already has us military facility ,the infrastructure for the container industry is already in place for a very important import and export industry..Wich provides thousands of jobs and millions of dollars in revenue annually..unfortunately if the C.G. moved into these locations it's going to be devastating on local jobs and the economy.. moving the C.G. in would cost way to much in regards to our economy,Wich is something we can't afford to do at this time.. Seattle will not befit from this,it's a very poor business decision for the people of Seattle 
Let's ask our selves how many new long term jobs is the C.G.going to create for the greater Seattle community?
T-46 is one of the only deep water docks where larger vessels can berth without any tide issues 
The important thing here is to remember about commerce.. Seattle needs more dock space for the container industry along with the cruise industry..
Also let me remind everyone how much revenue the cruise industry generates,if anything we should turn these docks into assets not liability s..Bad Idea!! Don't let this happen..

Don’t lose the access to cargo operations for a possible expansion of the US Coast Guard station.  Seattle has a history of maritime industrial use, and that terminal is a part of the city.  Coast Guard facilities could be accommodated in far more locations than berths for container ships.  Plus the infrastructure already exists for cargo operations.

As a dockworker that works here at Terminal 46. I think its a stupid idea allowing the Coast Guard to assume this Terminal. Not only will it kill jobs for hard working workers who provide for our families, but this will also decrease revenue for the Port of Seattle and for Seattle itself. The Coast guard already has its space here and frankly the Coast Guard should be towards the COAST. With my union Brothers and Sister I also am in with saying this would be a huge loss for everyone that is connected to Terminal 46

Seattle is a city because of its deep water port and working waterfront jobs that provide good wages to its diverse workforce.

RE: Base Seattle PEIS
11-21-2022

I appreciated the opportunity to attend the PEIS public forum that was held last week. I respect the US Coast Guards mission and duty and can appreciate its need to expand and modernize its facilities. However, I encourage the Coast Guard to evaluate alternate locations and avenues to expand than what the current 3 alternatives propose. We currently have finite resources of maritime terminal facilities on the USWC located in deep water ports in metro areas. T46 and T30 are 2 of these critical facilities that support the maritime cargo industry. They not only support the USWC but also support the entire PNW region. T46 and 30 are in very close proximity of the UP and BNSF rail ramps and I-5 corridor allowing for efficient movement of goods throughout the region. Both T30 and T46 provided critical to help with the backlog of cargo that was of national news and attention just of recent months. If these are taken away, they cannot be replaced or relocated. 
Instead of looking to take away NWSA maritime property we should be looking to add property and capacity to PNW gateway. It makes no sense to expand into the NWSA cargo facilities that are needed for the support of our local economies. Our farmers and agriculture exporters rely on these facilities to move their good to markets. These 2 facilities support thousands of warehouse workers, truckers, mechanics, logistic workers, retail workers, railroad workers and ILWU workers that pay living wages (just to name a few). 
I would request that the USCG look at alternative plans that don’t include taking away capacity and acreage of 2 key maritime cargo facilities. We must balance our national security needs with domestic priorities such as supply chain integrity, economic prosperity, and freight mobility infrastructure. Please work towards an outcome that results in no net-loss to freight capacity at T46 and T30.Please keep me posted on how this project moves ahead.

There are other options for the coast guard that are not being explored other than Seattle. The coast guard need to look at Everett where they have been offered space, Bremerton or whiskey island wheee federal land is already available and a possible joint venture with the navy, and illwaco wa. Wheee there is already existing a large coast guard base at the mouth of the Columbia river and an e oniony which would welcome it. Seattle is a shipping and cargo port and gas been before the coast guard has been there and echocardiogram economically needs to stay that way for people’s lively hood and seattles future. Ice breakers need to be kept t in Alaska wheee they are worked. The added pollution and environmental impact from them going for on Alaska to Seattle is emense and costly, it makes sense for them to be dry docked and kept closer to the waters in which they serve. The coast guard has not even looked at the restructuring of the lands they already occupy in Seattle for better efficiency and use of the same space without expansion, their administration could very well occupy the new office space being offered for lease across Alaska way and leave more room for their fleet, and as far as crane’s needed to load and unload ships the ilwu has been doing that for the military for a number of years and should continue to do so.

It’s disappointing to know that I have to write this. It is not disappointing to know that I am fighting for the right thing and the right future. 

To lose container space on terminals 30 and 46 would be a tragedy. Not only me, but all of the families that work on the Seattle waterfront and all of the families working in the freight industry will be hurt. Losing any container space is effectively an attack on the local community. Taking away jobs in these hard times. The space on both terminals 30 and 46 affects families far and wide. Workers who travel from all over Washington; the north, south, east and west for these amazing jobs. Everybody on the waterfront worked hard during the pandemic to keep our country and community going. Many people sacrificed their lives to covid, while working at the same terminals during the pandemic, in order to protect our way of life and continue to get the supplies needed to those who needed them the most. To take away any container space would put their sacrifice in vain.

Port Angeles Washington has a deep port and a protected bay. They have a large dock with plenty of acreage and access not being used. This would be the old Rainier mill site.

I’m a fan of the Coast Guard.  My son was a cadet in the academy. I work next door at Pier 46 where the CG proposed to acquire a large area of our dock and yard. We’ve already lost so much ground just since I started in 2008. Please consider relocating to another place that would benefit from the Coast Guard’s presence. In my opinion the facilities are so old, they must be expensive and inconvenient to maintain.  Seattle’s working waterfront provides jobs up and down the I-5 corridor but needs to maintain the capacity to attract shipping lines.

(9)  In a prior comment I mentioned the Expedia campus.. located on Elliot Bay.. is between Pier 90/91 and Terminal 86 the grain terminal.   Expedia is not a maritime industry.   This link shows an aerial view of this nearly vacant campus.   <https://mynorthwest.com/1541328/seattle-expedia-campus-interbay>.   
(10)  Regarding the PEIS statement that 'less than 50% of acquired land will be used for parking'  the PEIS seems out of step with WA State Commute Trip Reduction Act 6566 of 2006 which requires major employers to develop and implement an employee commute program to reduce the number and length of drive-alone commute trips made to the worksite.  The PEIS goes the other way... to enable more single occupancy commute trips.   On this topic, renovation of Base Seattle should include mass transit drop off, and a finger pier for water taxi.. Vigor Shipyard is 1/2 mile away by water.
(11)  The PEIS should be revised to show the cost, and time line, if at all possible, to restore what would be taken from T30, and T46, and where it would occur, and include road and highway and bridge and rail modifications. Congress deserves to know this.  Seattle and King County tax payers, who own the Port of Seattle deserve to know how they will be compensated for the taking of their marine terminals paid for by county wide property taxes.",,,,,,,

Port operations generate many family wage jobs and careers including: longshore/stevedores, trucking, logistics, warehouse workers, and mechanics/maintenance.  The implementation of any action plan to eliminate Port of Seattle land will result in the elimination of many of these job opportunities.  Additionally, both Terminals 30 and 46 are in strategic locations that allow truck drivers transporting agricultural exports direct access the Interstate 90 and direct connection to the growers and distributors of all major agricultural export commodities.  The expansion of USCG Base Seattle would significantly affect the movement of these cargoes throughout the gateway by decreasing the capacity of the terminals that are used for exporting these goods.

It makes little sense for the US Coast Guard to have their Base Expansion in Seattle.  Your new base should be closer to the Strait of Juan de Fuca, meaning the Ports of Everett and Bellingham would be better choices than Seattle.  It would also help the economies of those two cities.  The Terminals in Seattle should be focused on cargo ships and containers due to their proximity to rail lines and interstate highways (I-5 and I-90).  Loading and unloading cargo ships provides good paying, union jobs, and keeping those jobs should be a priority over a new Coast Guard Base that really doesn't need to be in Seattle.

On behalf of Pacific Environment, I submit these comments to express our support of the ILWU Local 19’s concerns about the Port of Seattle and Northwest Seaport Alliance’s (NWSA) lease of Terminals 30 and 46 to the U.S. Coast Guard Base Seattle, and to express our additional concerns. It is economically and ecologically asymmetrical to tout the potential freight delivery improvements that could come from the Terminal 5 Improvement Project to handle ultra-large container vessels while simultaneously considering the removal of T30 and T46’s freight-handling capacity in order to accommodate the Base Seattle. Shifting all of T30 and T46’s freight handling to an expanded T5 would entail significant new infrastructure development and stress the Duwamish Waterway, which is one of the nation’s worst superfund sites.  

The T30/T46 lease’s likely job losses and re-assignments would damage port-labor relations and risk the livelihoods of Washingtonians. As we are on the precipice of a global recession, the ports must take steps to support and bolster their workforce, and to ensure that a resilient, diverse and sustainable workforce will support the port as it weathers the coming storm.  Finally, we are concerned that Washington State regulations and port policy, including through the Northwest Ports Clean Air Strategy, will not be applied to the U.S. Coast Guard Seattle Base, including but not limited to rules on shore power, harbor craft electrification, or cleaner vessel mandates.

Bo McClung",,,,,,,

The Port of Seattle has long been a major source of stability for IBT members as a major ingress/egress point for West Coast shipping and logistics operations to international markets. We represent 8000 members in the warehouse and transportation industry that depend on the Port of Seattle for the cargo our members move around state. Everything from European wine to perishable goods, building supplies, and parts for the aerospace industry.
 
Every acre of lost container space on the waterfront equates to about 3,500 fewer containers that could move through on an annual basis. Accounting for the reduction in jobs on the waterfront that would result from this displacement is important to consider, but the total opportunity cost and market impact on Washington state would be much greater. That’s 3,500 fewer containers annually that could be full of agriculture products from our state’s farmers, aerospace parts for key industry sectors, or other manufactured goods produced by small businesses not just in Seattle – but across Washington state, and beyond. 40% of jobs in our state are dependent on trade in some way – including the jobs of most members in Local 174. 
 
Further, a more thorough traffic analysis needs to be done to account for how the dramatic proposed increase in private car trips to and from T46 and T30 would impact existing freight operations – and an already dangerous bicycle lane besides. Slow-downs in projected shipping times due to excess traffic, construction, and other factors can compromise the viability of freight berths just the same as improper land use decisions. 
 
Ultimately we need to balance the national security needs of Coast Guard operations with our domestic security needs related to economic prosperity, freight mobility, and supply chain cohesion. We should work towards a solution that results in no net-loss of containerized cargo capacity at T30 and T46.

I'm writing in support of keeping pier 30 and 46 as fully operational container ports. There are very few ports in the northwest with cranes in place to load, unload, and store containers. It makes no sense, to me, to have the Coast Guard take over these ports. We would lose thousands of very good wage jobs across multiple industries. This raises the living standard and brings in far more money to the communities of local cities, counties, and the state as a whole than the coast guard is capable of. There are a lot of other ports in the Northwest that would be better suited to keep these Coast Guard vessels than for us to give up a crane terminal that would be nearly impossible to replace.

The Coast Guard is structured to be operated by transient workers who are stationed here for a few years then leave. They are not concerned with the long term health of our communities and the fact that they are requesting to take over pier 30 & 46, over all other options along the coast, proves that they have no idea or concern about the severe negative impact that would have.

 We have great jobs, we support our local community. Every time I work I pay for a caregivers to be with my partner and I know how much that means to them and the day will come when she will need to go to a memory care facility which is really expensive.
 In the years past I remember talking of moving the Coast Guard to an Alaskan port, a better choice  instead on limiting our jobs and the movement of cargo in the northwest which will only grow as the years go by.

I eagerly plead you to keep the container terminals operating the way they are on Seattle's waterfront. Blue collar jobs are getting harder to come by in this economy and shrinking the terminal capacity of seattle only hinders decent work opportunities for men and woman to provide a livable wage for themselves and their families. The financial damage you would cause to the hundreds of men and woman who heavily rely on these terminals for their wages is immense. 
There must be other areas and space available for the coast guard around the puget sound. It surprises me they haven’t chosen a more open place if they want to expand their operations. The ports of Everett and Tacoma seem like they could be accommodating places. Maybe even over in Magnolia or Edmonds. Even looking at smaller coastal towns like most of our other military bases have done would seem like a good option. Adding a base of operations to a smaller coastal town to create an influx of jobs for the area, strengthening their smaller economies and relieving the already over burdened seattle area waterfront seems ideal!
I greatly urge you to reconsider this plan for the coast guard in Seattle, my families livelihood is at stake here and I think there’s better options for you out there. Please please reconsider.

Seattle is a port city. Seattle is a gateway to the US. We need to Coast Guard, but we also need our working waterfront. Seattle is consistently listed in the top 5 busiest ports in the nation and cannot afford to lose container terminal space. As I understand it, part of the land the Coast Guard is looking for would be used for parking. Couldn’t parking be created across the street on the land previously used for the 99 tunnel construction? What about Jack Perry Park? That park seems to be very underutilized and old pilings can be seen poking out of the water. Could that park be closed and the current Coast Guard facility be expanded south? Seems that not all options have been considered and instead of working with the container terminals you are working against them.

I support the Coast Guard but there is no reason to lose valuable cargo space to an unnecessary parking lost and/or vessel berthing that does not require a deep water berth.

Based on review of the Draft PEIS, the Department of Ecology’s (Ecology) Water Quality Program staff in our Northwest Region have the following comments:

Identify and Remove PCB-Containing Building Materials
As noted on page 3-37 of the Draft PEIS, demolition activities associated with upland construction could disturb hazardous building materials such as asbestos and lead-based paint. To avoid release into the surrounding waters, USCG states that all hazardous materials and wastes would be managed appropriately and comply with all federal, state, and local laws. Ecology would like to point out the potential presence of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in building materials at Base Seattle, and the need to properly identify, remove, and manage those materials. PCBs are one of the main risk drivers in the East Waterway Operable Unit of the Harbor Island Superfund site, so it is especially important for USCG to remove PCB sources from their Base Seattle facility and help protect future sediment cleanup investments. Through Ecology’s role implementing Source Control actions around the Lower Duwamish Waterway and other work such as the National Estuary Program-funded PCBs in Building Materials project, we have developed expertise in identifying and removing sources of Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs) from the urban built environment. Ecology, USEPA, and the City of Seattle are aware that PCBs were used in exterior building materials such as caulk and other joint material, certain types of roofing and siding, paint, and other items in the Seattle area when buildings were built or renovated between 1930 and 1980. We also know that it’s more likely that PCBs are released from these materials, and can enter stormwater and surface waters, when they are disturbed during demolition and renovation activities. Ecology recently published the guidance document How to Find and Address PCBs in Building Materials to guide property owners, contractors, and developers through the process of identifying and abating PCBs in building materials. Ecology recommends that USCG seeks to determine if PCB-containing building materials exist at Base Seattle prior to starting any construction activities to ensure that the re-development does not release PCBs to the adjacent East Waterway or stormwater infrastructure. USCG should use Ecology’s guidance document or USEPA guidance to evaluate for the presence of PCBs, and remove them, from all structures at Base Seattle.

NPDES Permit Coverage
As described on page 3-39 of the Draft PEIS, Base Seattle currently meets USEPA’s no exposure exclusion and therefore does not require a NPDES permit, and USCG anticipates that the Base would continue to meet USEPA’s no exposure exclusion after modernization/expansion re-development. The ability to obtain a no exposure exclusion from a federally-issued NPDES permit would need to be re-evaluated by USEPA after project completion. Furthermore, Ecology would like to point out that, due to the size of the proposed re-development at Base Seattle, it is possible and likely that USCG would need to obtain coverage under the federal Construction General Permit (CGP) prior to starting construction activities. The CGP authorizes the discharge of stormwater (and certain authorized non-stormwater discharges) from construction sites that disturb one acre or more of land, and from smaller sites that are part of a larger, common plan of development. Ecology recommends that USCG work with USEPA to obtain NPDES permit coverage, as needed, prior to construction at Base Seattle.

Sewage Pumpout Infrastructure
It is Ecology’s understanding that USCG currently maintains facilities at the Base Seattle location to pump out vessel sewage and direct it to the local sanitary sewer. Using pumpout infrastructure helps USCG comply with the Puget Sound Vessel Sewage No Discharge Zone (NDZ) (WAC 173-228). Ecology suggests that, regardless of which modernization/expansion alternative is selected, USCG ensure that there will be adequate pumpout infrastructure installed at the Base Seattle facility in order to pump sewage from the greater number of vessels that may be stationed onsite. In addition to ensuring enough pumpout capacity and obtaining appropriate authorizations from the local sanitary sewer provider, Ecology suggests that USCG consider making the location of new pumpout infrastructure at Base Seattle convenient for staff to access and use.

Thank you for considering these comments and suggestions from Ecology. If you have any questions or would like to respond to these comments, please contact Jess Huybregts from the Water Quality Program at (425) 941-8633 or by email at jessica.huybregts@ecy.wa.gov.

I am writing on behalf of the MLK Labor council and the more than 100,000 union workers represented by our affiliates.

We believe that to maximize the Coast Guard’s existing footprint and minimize the impact on marine cargo operations, any expansion of the Coast Guard base should result in no net loss of container space at Piers 30 and 46. The fifth berth should be built on existing Coast Guard property and any increase in permanent staffing for the base should be located offsite and/or minimized.

Port supply chains are already stressed and can’t handle any extra roadblocks because of construction or shipping changes. Every acre of lost terminal space reduces our capacity to handle 3,500 shipping containers each year. Inflation is already hurting working families, so changes to our cargo capacity will only add more stress.

We’re proud that the Port of Seattle is one of the most efficient port systems in the country thanks to public and private investments. Changes to Terminal 30 and 46 would mean that two of our major terminals would no longer be usable for freight operations.

The Port of Seattle is committed to supporting family-wage job opportunities. Changes to operations at Terminals 30 and 46 go against that commitment and put union workers at risk. Our jobs can’t be replaced.

Since space is limited, terminals need to be reserved specifically for industrial marine operations. We respect the Coast Guard’s mission at the Port, but their proposed plan doesn’t require waterfront space in the same way our work does.

I oppose this as our economy relies on the supply chain, the cargo that could be lost is over 30,000 containers per year. Every container that must arrive by truck or train from another port adds extra cost to The consumer. We must realize imports are very important to our economy.

This will have a direct and adverse effect on our economy that is already struggling. This will effect so many, from the local farmers and businesses to the families that are already living on a tight budget, and cannot afford higher prices for their goods.

The direct effect on Seattle Resteraunt’s and stores that thrive due to the work force coming to Seattle to work those piers, work force that will be no longer needed, living wage jobs will be in lost.

Deep water ports are limited and giving up the revenue is harmful to all and unwarranted!!!

Please consider carefully the full impact this could have as Seattle ports are one of the highest in productivity.

I am opposed to this for a couple reasons. Our supply chain has been failing us, and we can’t afford to lose this important space that fuels the local economy and supply chain. And secondly our environment is precious, too precious to be bringing ice cutters into our city as these boats would use a lot less fuel if they were to be up north further closer to the ice they might be cutting and away from our already busy shipping lanes that endanger our whales. Lastly why are we cutting ice if we are “trying to stop global warming”???

To whom this may concern,

 I respectfully support of the US coast guard  And what they do for our country. 

However 
 This being said  I also understand the Essential role the Seattle working waterfront Is to my community and Commerce of the city of Seattle.  
  Shipping and receiving Containers in our  Deep water port is  Vital To the growing city of Seattle!...Not to mention good working wages for families and  Businesses in our communities as a whole.

 I am a 4th generation longshoreman And a tax paying homeowners in Seattle. 
  I will help to protect and preserve Seattle's working waterfront not only for my children, but for the countless Small businesses and families this will be affected along the way from our truckers to our  Store fronts.  

I feel  the trickle down effect of this decision to  Eradicate vital  Seattle shipping ports will affect our community in ways that possibly the coast guard is not thinking of???   An injury to one is an injury to all and there are clearly more options for the Us coast guard other than Seattle.

 Have all other possible options for Coast Guard  been explored?... such as Bremerton WA., Everett WA., Port Angeles wa., or Whidbey Island wa.  Just to name a few Puget sound properties.
Why is Ilwaco WA. Not being mentioned?  It is at the mouth of the Columbia River, has a large existing Coast Guard station and housing, and may welcome the extra jobs and revenue. Utilizing some of these smaller  Places would not Only be welcomed by these smaller communities... but would not affect port of Seattle in prosperous and essential  Existing deep water port shipping.

  Why not Alaska? The Coast Guard ice breakers and cutters would give less of an environmental impact on coastal and international waters if they were stationed in the north or Alaska which are closed to the waters they will be working. Not to mention would save taxpayers a lot of money in the long run when using this equipment.

 The port of Seattle is clearly not the only option for the US coast guard. But if you look around the Seattle waterfront? Terminal 30 and terminal 46 cannot be replaced as deep water shipping ports. 
To keep Essential jobs to families and  Commerce  in our city  of Seattle going strong for generations to come.

Thank you for your time.

U.S. Coast Guard,

I stand with the ILWU in that there should be no net loss of container operations in Seattle.

I question, have all options been exercised? Are terminals 30 and 46 the only options available for the U.S. Coast Guard to make these additions?

As we have seen through COVID, there has been a large demand for container work during the back-log on the west coast. Is it really the best idea for our country and economy to reduce our handling capacity of such cargo?

The Port of Seattle with the ILWU offers good paying jobs for our citizens. If we as a nation continue to step on the jurisdiction of these good paying jobs, how will these jobs be replaced? We must not take for granted how important it is to keep good paying union jobs where ever they may be located.

I urge to you that there should be no net loss of container operations in the Port of Seattle, as well as the whole West Coast.

In this time in our society, lack of work and lack of people wanting to work is among us more than ever. The more Port availability the more workers is needed to operate and move cargo and other miscellaneous products/needs for our city/state. 
Seattle is a lovely city to visit for tourists, but if we continue to lose the battle of being “taken away” for any rhythm or reason, then we will see our future turn into AI’s and the increasing homelessness. We need Port 46- We have people who wants to work! Not just the time being but also for our future.

     It seems to me that redirecting cargo from both terminals 30 and 46 would cause a constant gridlock in and out of terminals 5 and 18, for which there is not enough space.  This would certainly result in our work going to other ports.  The financial impact would be felt by longshoremen and the city, on many levels of which you are certainly aware.  

     Farmers in eastern Washington, the ever increasing population of Seattle and outlying areas, all rely on these terminals for a flowing supply chain.  In fact, we have already felt the impact from the loss of the southern portion of 46 that we already gave to the coastguard.  
The use of these piers for anything but shipping seems at the very least, absurd.

Additionally, the rail operations would also be impacted with potential for less imports coming through the Port of Seattle if terminals lose capacity for holding these imports.

As a 35+ year mariner, I think removing paper charts from ships is the biggest nautical mistake ever.  Electronic charts are at best a supplement to paper charts and at worst, a toy that distracts and makes for lazy mariners.  Google maps has already created a generation that can't read a road atlas; now we have new mariners coming out of schools that can't read a chart.  Below are some other reasons I feel that the world is making a colossal mistake with e-charts:
1.  USS Guardian (I am sure millions were spent trying to figure the cause of the grounding, but it was an over reliance on e-charts).
2.  You can not see the 'big picture' on an e-chart.  Zooming in and out on a small screen is ridiculous.  Try planning a route out of Nuka'alofa, Tonga using an e-chart or through the waters of Papua New Guinea.
3.  No one spends time correcting an e-chart.  Correcting a paper chart takes time yes, but during that time the person gains knowledge of the area that the ship will be passing through; perhaps noticing some small shoal or wreck or a notice that some island may not be in the charted position.
4.  Paper charts can't be hacked.  Shipping companies are spending fortunes protecting their ships from cyber attacks.   Computers are vulnerable to sabotage and GPS can be spoofed.
5.  E-charts require electricity.  If a ship breaks down eventually even the backup batteries of an ECDIS will fail.
6.  E-charts are expensive.  Smaller boats do not have the means to install and power up such systems.
7.  Try abandoning ship with your ECDIS system.  
8.  A general loss of nautical knowledge by using e-charts.  Navigating just becomes a video game.  So many times I have had young mates tell me that the ship was in one position when simply looking out the window would have told them something different.  Forget knowing how to use a sextant or even a compass or knowing how to steer.
9.  An over reliance on GPS.  Everything comes down to a system, that while it is amazing and very helpful, is very vulnerable to attack and failure.  Besides e-charts there are any number of navigation instruments that require GPS input.  Amazingly we now have gyro compass systems that fail if they lose GPS signal (I would love to hear the logic of who approved that design).

Reading what I have written, I see that I may be coming across as an old sailor not willing to change, but that is not the case.  I do believe that e-charts have a place at sea and with proper training and an acknowledgment of their limitations can be a great bridge management tool.  However, I don't believe they should be a replacement for everything analog.  Governments should continue to publish paper charts and keep mariners involved in the correction process.",,,,,,,

The use of electronic charts is convenient for many mariners and gives relatively accurate information about immediate situations as long as the charting equipment is functioning properly. After witnessing the failure of electronic navigation equipment on a variety of occasions I do not feel that the elimination of paper charts is wise. Paper charts have been used for millennia and they do not ""crash,"" have improper Datum imputed as their base which distorts their accuracy and do not suffer errors or eliminated data due to the used defined parameters. A properly updated paper chart gives you all of the available data in an area and allows the user to absorb the pertinent data and discount the unnecessary data but they will have still been made aware of all of the data that is in the area. Paper charts allow a view of the total area in which the mariner is operating where as electronic charts, unless displayed on a massive monitor and with all data functions turned on, only provide a tiny snippet of a charted area and thus this reduces the ability of the mariner to gain an overall picture of their area of operations. 

Electronic charting also bring a sense of complacency to a bridge. If the mariner is on the screen in what looks like the right position what could go wrong?  Getting ones head out of the boat and looking around, using all of the other navigation tools available and double checking the accuracy of all navigation tools on a regular basis throughout the watch is the only way to guarantee safe navigation. If we remove one of those tool, paper charts, we are reducing the accuracy of our navigation and limiting our ability to operate vessels in the safest manner possible.

Our organization represents Subchapter T Small Passenger Vessels which operate in both California and Mexico. The vessels operate from 1-16 days at sea sportfishing with up to approximately 100 passengers on day boats and up to 49 passengers on overnight boats. The vessels range in size from 45 to 118 feet in length. All of these vessels currently have some type of electronic chart plotting equipment aboard. This is a tool used for fishing activities and navigation. That said, every vessel has a set up paper charts which guarantees plotting capabilities, regardless of if power has for some reason shut off to the electronic plotters.  Common systems currently used are Garmin and Nobeltech.  The current application and use of electronic charts is working well with paper charts also aboard. Looking to the future, consideration has to be given to what equipment or systems might be required, can the vessels support the hardware and space utilization and of course cost. Training requirements for full chart-navigation are typically 5 days at several facilities nationwide. Cost in transportation, lodging wages and any certification course fees ($1400+) should be taken into consideration. The hardware and software for small passenger vessels may be out of their reach financially.

We have operated on the Illinois River for over 60 years, in those 60+ years we have seen huge strides and changes in how we navigate waterways. The most recent being AIS in aiding navigation. Once introduced we have seen a drastic drop in bridge-to-bridge communication. With the knowledge and experience of such a change that is one of many fears/concerns we have with the elimination of paper charts. 

We have 3 vessels all of which hold a COI, none of which have electronic charts. We run on average a 4-mile range as a harbor service. With the implementation of a mandatory electronic chart system, like many small companies, this would force an expensive addition to the current rise of costs of running a business in our economy.

Pleasure craft presence is also a huge concern we have, with no experience needed for large pleasure crafts and yachts operating the waterways with many running off paper charts the safety impact could be catastrophic towards them as well as us.

Electronic charts are admittingly a good tool to use if available, but to take away a safety tool that cannot be compromised by cyber-attack, electronic failure, or misinformation we believe is gross negligence from the United States Coast Guard.

In closing, myself as a Master Mariner Unlimited as well as the company I represent we as a whole are 100% against this unneeded change.

I am working aboard a small passenger vessel, a sailing vessel.  I use a 12"" display, but it is impracticable to have the same ECDIS equipment used on larger vessels. While I am happy to see the requirement for up-to -date paper charts go away, I would like to see the print on demand paper charts and raster charts remain.. 

One issue that needs to be solved is the ability to update electronic charts.  The chart display equipment available from popular manufactures such as Garmin Furuno, Raymarine etc. do not make this easy.  I contacted Furuno about this.  Their equipment accepts the .dbv or .dbr file format.  The NOAA website offers files in in the form of a .000 format.  Furuno creates a single .dbv file that is the enc for the whole west coast.  But they only come out with an update .dbv file once a year in the spring. Is this yearly update acceptable to the USCG?  The solution for more frequent updates is for either NOAA to produce a enc chart update file in the .dbv formant that existing ECS equipment can read.  Then we can update as fast as noaa provides updates without waiting on a 3rd party to convert the enc file format and release in the proprietary format.  Or Furuno and Garmin need to create a product that can read the files as they are produced by noaa.  They may not have the immediate incentive to do this because the recreational vessels are not subject to the same chart carriage requirements as  small passenger vessels.  The recreational vessel market is a larger market.  But the ability to update noaa encs more than once a year would improve safety for both recreational and inspected vessels.",,,,,,,

Our company produces Marine Navigation Software programs as well as hard copy (paper) navigational products. We are also a NOAA-Certified Chart Agent for Print-on-Demand paper charts. Our staff consists of a number of USCG licensed mariners and the president is a former Merchant Mariner and graduate of Massachusetts Maritime Academy.

In regards to Question 1— While electronic chart systems are important tools for modern navigation, they are not infallible. We feel the guaranteed availability of paper charts has intrinsic value to safe navigation, especially for vessels that do not have the means to employ expensive ECDIS systems.

Smaller size vessels can often only accommodate small screen sizes which makes it difficult to show sufficient chart detail without sacrificing the ability to look ahead or view your surrounding chart data effectively. Due to their larger format, paper charts offer superior situational awareness compared to electronics as they are better at providing the ""big picture.""

Many mariners prefer to plan their trips on paper charts.

We submit that electronic charts should not be mandatory on certain vessels and that certified NOAA paper charts should continue to be made available to all mariners to help ensure safety of life at sea.

In regards to Question 7—Paper charts are not subject to cyber security and should always be available to the navigator as a fully secure alternate system to be used independently or in conjunction with electronic charts.

In regards to Question 8— The scale of an electronic chart depends on the hardware and user preferences. We do not feel that specific scales should be mandated, the current language regarding ""appropriate detail"" is sufficient and gives the navigator reasonable discretion.

In regards to Question 9— Our experience (and that of thousands of our customers) is that paper charts are the ultimate backup as all electronic devices can be subject to hardware, software, malware, cyber attacks and infrastructure failures. We suggest that the USCG should require paper charts as a reliable backup to electronics.

In regards to Question 11—We would consider ECDIS systems to be between ""very uncommon"" and ""uncommon"" on most of the inspected vessels that we supply (mid to small size commercial vessels). We find that other electronic chart systems would be between ""common"" and ""very common"" on the vessels that we supply. Maptech would consider paper charts to be ""very common"" within the professional mariner industry that we serve. We print and sell thousands of POD charts each year and provide significantly more non-certified NOAA charts to recreational boaters as well.

NOAA performed a POD vendor webinar in 2021 where they demonstrated the use of their new NOAA Custom Chart (NCC) program which uses ENC data to create paper charts. In that webinar, they mentioned the possibility of launching a NOAA Print on Demand ""POD 2.0"" program where NCC generated charts could possibly be recognized for carriage. We support this idea and encourage the USCG to work with NOAA to recognize NCC generated charts as a legitimate carriage option.

Since the NCC program is still in development, we ask that the USCG request that NOAA pause the cancellation of traditional NOAA charts until such time that the NCC can produce charts that are suitable for fulfilling carriage requirements.

The statement that the USCG is considering requiring electronic charts because NOAA is sunsetting traditional paper charts does not make sense. Many navigators are certain that paper charts are a critical component of safe navigation. We request that the USCG inform NOAA of this fact and that it does not matter if paper charts are produced from the traditional raster database or from the new NOAA (NCC) charts, as long as they provide comprehensive navigation information in a useful manner.

We fully support a revision of the rules regarding the ongoing corrections to paper charts as electronic charts will always be easier to update. At the same time, electronics can never be as reliable as paper. We feel that these two formats work well together and are not mutually exclusive.

Basic plotting and navigation procedures have proven their worth through the years. Is the public interest served if these skills are no longer taught and mariners become completely reliant on electronics only? We submit that it would not.

I am a marine electronics dealer and installer as well as a licensed captain.  I have been boating since 1973 and have been from Main to Florida through the Bahamas and the Caribbean.  We always tell all our customers to make sure they are using paper charts along side of their chart plotter for these reasons:

1. Anything that requires power will fail you.  
   - All firmware on electronics has bugs that show up at the most inconvenient times
   - GPS antennas can receive a weak inaccurate signal or no signal at all
   - All chart plotters will lock up from time to time just like a computer
   - Power failures are common on boats (bad fuse, weak battery, breaker, bad ground,
     lightning strike and etc.)

2. Depending on the zoom level on the chart plotter, you could be using a dangerous smaller scale chart in an area that a large scale chart should be used and you would never know it.

3.  Electronic chart plotters are difficult to use.  Even when we teach our customers on how to use them, we always get calls from users who can't figure out how to do simple tasks.  For example most users do not know how to orient the chart while navigating ( North or course up) or how to keep the boat from running off the page.  We get a lot of calls from customers who do not know how to turn up the brightness so they can even see the chart.

4. Everyone complains that when using vector charts, you can't seem to make the print any larger.  When you zoom in the print never gets larger.  This is frustrating when trying to read navigation aid details, a bridge height, soundings, danger zones and etc.

5.  If you require tech support to try and trouble shoot your chart plotter you can only reach tech support from 9 to 5 on a weekday.  They don't care you only use your boat on the weekend.  And when you get a tech support person, it is someone from the Philippines who you cannot even understand. 

The fact is paper charts always work, never require tech support, easy to read, easy to use and never fail you.  Why would you not make paper charts a carriage requirement? Not all boats can even feasibly use a chart plotter and some people can not afford a chart plotter.  If you told all the boaters out there that soon they will not be able to get paper charts there would be a riot in the streets.  

The NOAA custom chart maker website is not the answer for many reasons.  First of which users are not going to understand how to use it, and by the way there is no tech support number to call.  Second, it does not make a chart that is complete as the RNC.  Many of the details are not there, no topography, no roads, no spires, water towers or tower to reference.  Thirdly, the coverage is not complete, seems that the ENC database is complete where there is heavy commercial shipping traffic but not in smaller bays and rivers. And forth, no one wants charts on 8.5"" by 11.5"" piece of copy paper.

Please continue to make paper charts the minimum carriage requirement and lean on NOAA to keep making and updating the RNCs!

To those this concerns:
Please do not change the carriage requirements for commercial vessels to carry paper charts. As licensed captains, we have experienced situations when our electronic plotter has failed and, without a paper back up, we would have been in serious trouble. 
There are any number of reasons why electronic charts can fail a navigator and other comments have given great detail as to what they are. Our comment is to say that, if we had not been following the course on a paper chart, the failure of our plotter at a critical turn, could have caused a grounding and possible serious damage to the vessel we were delivering.  A quick change to navigation by paper kept us safe and the vessel intact.
Although we do use electronic plotters for their convenience and quick reference, we have and will always maintain a paper chart back up, especially for planning and emergency situations.

We provide navigation and compliance tools for vessels of all sizes. Bluewater is an official distributor for official hydrographic charts around the world namely NOAA and the UKHO (for US waters). One of my primary responsibilities is to oversee our superyacht department which specializes in providing regulatory compliance services and products to large yachts (LY) sector. The only legal definition for LY is put forth by the Maritime and Costal Administration (MCA) as vessels over 24 meters. My comments come from my experience in dealing with LYs, many of which are over 500gt.

I recently wrote an article detailing some of the issues that yachts face when transitioning from paper to ECDIS based navigation. Some of my answers come directly from this article. You can find the link here:
https://www.bluewaterweb.com/blog/post/time-to-dump-paper-charts-by-erik-speyer

I have also attached a document that Lloyds register put forth in 2016. It covers more than the requirements for charts onboard, but we believe the message is the same. “Essentially boiling down to acceptance of a Commercial Registry and evidence of compliance with the Flag’s applicable Commercial Yacht Code”. As it stands the LY’s are not being required by their flag to adopt ECIDS (fully paperless) standards, and therefore we believe that the USCG should follow suit with port-state across the world in accepting the Flag’s commercial approval on these matters.

Question 1
We believe that LYs should be allowed to use paper charts as their primary means of navigation. The switch from paper to ECDIS has more to consider than just cost (see article above). The paper charts should come from an official hydrographic office that produces charts for the relevant waters. In US waters the two agencies are NOAA and the UKHO. The paper charts should have the weekly corrections applied and be fully up to date.

Question 5
Yes, Large Yachts should be exempt from ECS requirements, assuming they are carrying the required corrected paper charts. Most of these vessels are running additional software such as Transas with TX-97 charts or Timezero with CMAP or Navionics charts. Both options make use of private data in addition to commercially available data (ENCs). In my cases, this data is better than the ENC data. In these configurations they do not meet the standards for ECDIS but offer the vessel the best data options. In both examples the vessel’s primary means of navigation are paper charts from an official source.

Question 7
Waiting on an answer from Corey.

Question 9
We defer to the IMO and SOLAS regulations on this matter. The vessel can either adhere to full ECDIS standards including full redundancy and power supplies. In this case that is the vessel’s primary means of navigation. If they do not meet those standards, then they must carry the requisite paper charts are their primary means of navigation. We always suggest vessels take paper charts as back up no matter what systems they are running. They are the best form of insurance in the case of ECS failure.

Question 11
All of the vessels we supply have some form of an ECS. Timezero and ECDIS capable units are the most common. The ECDIS-capable units are not running to ECDIS spec, they simply use them as an ECS. I have never worked with a vessel that did not have some form of ECS on the bridge. Again, we are specifically referencing Large Yachts.

Question 13
Our customers spend quite a large amount of time doing chart corrections. We have two full time employees to correct our customers charts as a service. There is no doubt it is a labor intensive process.


Question 14
Averaging the annual ENC usage for 80 yachts, the cost for 2021 was about $3,000 dollars per year. In comparison, a similar group of paper-based yachts spent about $6,000 per year on updated charts, plus $2,000 per year for the software that enables them to do onboard corrections.

As a result, we have had no serious incidents aboard Searcher.

We would also say that our prayers go out to the families of the tragic event on board the Conception. This event was totally preventable and the investigations came to that conclusion. If the crew and owner complied with their COI, the tragedy may have been avoided. We agree that an event like this shouldn’t happen again. 
The interconnected fire alarm and visual signal is excessive. We have a subdivision bulkhead, two berthing compartments and every cabin has a smoke alarm. If a smoke alarm in one cabin goes off the whole compartment hears it, and if the smoke alarm in the hallway goes off ,the whole compartment hears that as well. These smoke alarms are checked quarterly as part of our Safety Management System. Hopefully there will be a system that meets the requirement for boats like the Searcher.

J.W. Mauger,
Rear Admiral, U.S. Coast Guard, 
Assistant Commandant for Prevention Policy
2703 Martin Luther King Ave SE Stop 7501
Washington, D.C. 20593-7103.

	Dear Mr. Mauger,
The United States Coast Guard is being given an opportunity to bring a quick solution to a straightforward and simple problem prevalent in their branch, as well as the other branches of the military and the marine community. The concern with the fire safety of small passenger vessels in their fleet poses a question to rulemakers for a fix and it seems progress is already being made towards a solution.
	There have been some loopholes, flaws, and other problems with the guidelines that the Coast Guard uses to regulate their fleet, including a lack of fire extinguisher requirements. This is a simple necessity that should have already been in place to prevent any unnecessary disasters from occurring. On top of that, the training for fire prevention within the Coast Guard is also under a microscope, with many saying it needs to be addressed and the members need to be aware of how to operate their ship both properly and safely. Last year, a fire struck a Coast Guard vessel under repair that was stationed in Tampa Bay, and luckily nobody involved sustained any major injuries. Our Coast Guard, the people who protect the citizens within the oceans that they explore, needs to be able to do their daily duties with the smallest chance of known disaster possible, it is an avoidable issue if we were to teach our Coast Guard members basic to intermediate firefighting, as it is a skill that could be useful for them and their profession.
	Other changes to these vessels will allow for a safer boating experience for whatever team will be stationed on the vessel. Some of these changes are heavily practiced in the average American home, but have gone swept under the radar in the Guard. This includes fire detection, portable extinguishers, and hiring watchmen to look over unused ships. These are changes I find to be completely necessary for the efficient operation of a major institution in our country and I hope this comment finds you well.
Sincerely,
Jack Silva, Political Science Student, University of Massachusetts - Amherst

My company owns and operates 3 small passenger vessels in San Diego. Each of these vessels are constructed with overnight accommodations.
I appreciate the opportunity to provide public comment on the proposed rulemaking regarding fire safety on Small Passenger Vessels.
I am a second-generation credentialed mariner, with a career spanning over 50 years. My son is third generation and has been credentialed over a decade. 
Like my father before me, I have seen the evolution of our fleet as well as evolving safety measure implemented throughout the years. We have always supported safety in our industry, and our record speaks for itself. Our entire industry has an incredible record of safety when the number of passengers carried annually over the past 50 years is taken into consideration.
Our fleet mourned the loss of life on September 2, 2019. Our hearts go out to the families left behind of those who never returned.
In citing the NTSB report and the Federal Register, it is stated human error is a causative factor in this event. Having not been onboard, and going by this report, I would agree, with no crewman on watch while passengers were present was a dereliction of duty and direct defiance of prudent seamanship and federal regulation.
We support enhanced early warning systems such as unified smoke alarms, accountability for watch standers, additional fire suppression training for crew, and egress demonstrations for passengers.
Proposed regulations regarding construction and arrangement will cause many small businesses such as mine to go out of business simply due to our ability to comply with the way the rule is written. Our vessels were built with means of escape. They have proven safe throughout the years. We can modify them to a degree, and to a degree that will meet the intent of this rule without causing devastating economic impact to my company.
Please do not misinterpret my statement as putting profit before safety. Safety has always been paramount in my family’s business. We simply feel that working with our local inspectors who know our vessels better than those drafting policy in a reactive manner, can create a comprehensive plan that meets or exceeds the intent of the construction and arrangement portion of this rule.
I ask USCG grant local inspectors the latitude to work with individual vessel captains and owners to satisfy the requirements of this rule with minimal financial impact while simultaneously ensure the safety of passengers and crew.
Thank you,

My name is Frank Brenha Jr. I am a third-generation fisherman and credentialed mariner in San Diego. Our family vessel, Producer, has been transporting passengers safely offshore for decades.
For the record, I want to state we are in support of additional safety measures as defined by the proposed rule. The addition of central alarm systems for early detection can do nothing but make the voyage safer. Additional fire training for crew, and egress drills with passengers goes without saying; again, all reasonable actions to support preparedness for emergency situations.
Producer Sportfishing has an impeccable safety record, and the vessel was built and designed with egress per USCG standards. We have ample means of egress for our berthing areas. It is important to note, our bunkroom areas, like many in the inspected fleet were arranged and constructed with safety and egress in mind. They are safe, and with the additional proposed early detection systems, can strongly conclude this further enhances the safety systems onboard my vessel.
NTSB concluded the fire went largely undetected due to the absence of a watch stander. This is not industry practice. Rules state a roving patrolman must be appointed any time passengers are present onboard the vessel. Clearly, according to the NTSB report and the Federal Register, this was a causative factor that allowed a fire to take root resulting in 34 lives lost. Like the families impacted, our maritime community was shocked and at a loss for words. 
I ask that USCG grant local inspectors the ability and latitude to work with vessel owners and operators with regards to construction and arrangement to meet the intent of the rule. We care about the safety of our passengers, our crews, and our vessels.
Thank you,
Frank Brenha Jr.

I would like to provide public comment regarding proposed rule making on Fire Safety for Small Passenger Vessels. 
My background in this industry dates back over 50 years. My record as a credentialed mariner is unblemished throughout this time, and I consider myself a prudent mariner. 
The events that occurred on September 2, 2019 were tragic to say the least,. The loss of life was staggering and incomprehensible to the entire maritime community. NTSB states human error to be a causative factor. I will concur with their findings. Not having a watch stander appointed when passengers were present is an egregious act to say the least.
As a 50-year professional mariner, my thoughts are with the families of those whose lives were lost in this avoidable tragedy.
Moving through the rule making, I support the addition of early warning fire detection such as unified alarm systems, enhanced fire suppression training for crew, dedicated charging stations, watch stander monitoring, and egress drills for passengers. All of these measures will better the safety protocols already in place.
I would like to touch briefly on construction and arrangement. Our fleet of Small Passenger Vessels are purpose-built vessels that were designed by naval architects to meet stringent USCG safety and stability standards. Access and egress were approved with original construction. The rule calls for a “one size fits all” set of standards that will be impossible for some to comply with and for others will mean a significant decrease in capacity. 
The intent of the rule is to ensure the safety of passengers and crew while at sea. I strongly urge USCG to empower their inspectors with the ability to work with vessel owners and operators to ensure they are meeting the intent of the proposed rulemaking. Grant the inspector the latitude to make judgment in the field with the vessels they are intimate with. Your inspectors have firsthand knowledge of our fleet and a relationship with the vessel owner to better make those decisions. 
I will also ask at this time USCG conduct an economic impact study to understand how the proposed rule will impact vessels challenged with compliance in whole or in part.
Furthermore, there needs to be consideration with implementation due to supply chain issues and professionals (shipwrights and shipyards) to affect those elements of the rule that will be passed.
I appreciate the opportunity to provide input. I want to acknowledge NTSB for their work post incident as well as USCG inspectors in the field. Their swift response kept us on the water and provided education for our mariners. 
Thank you,

Robert Taft

Thank you for the opportunity to provide comment on the proposed rulemaking on Fire Safety for Small Passenger Vessels.
My name is Scott McDaniels, owner operator of Sea Adventure 80. I have been a credentialed mariner for 48 years, rated at 500 tons/Ocean. Having owned and operated multiple small passenger vessels throughout my career, I find it important to weigh in on the action before us today.
First, I want to express my condolences to the families of the victims onboard the Conception September 2, 2019. While we can never bring their loved ones back, we can learn from this senseless tragedy, and avoid such atrocities in the future.
As a professional mariner, I support the additional early warning systems proposed such as unified smoke alarms, watch stander monitoring, additional fire suppression training for the crew, monitored charging stations for portable devices, and escape drills for passengers. All these actions will make the experience safe for passengers, vessels, and their crews. 
Construction and arrangement will be the most challenging aspect of this rulemaking. Our fleet was built to USCG standards with access and egress specifically designed. The tragic events that occurred onboard Conception had nothing to do with access and egress. NTSB clearly stated in their report no watch stander was present. This statement alone violates one of the most sacred rules associated with carrying passengers for hire; a watch stander must be appointed whenever passengers are present. One can only assume, according to NTSB’s findings, should a crewman have been present, early detection, evacuation, and suppression may have occurred. 
I find it challenging with our fleet’s overall safety record, we are considering changing construction and arrangement based on this incident and NTSB’s findings.
Our fleet is made up of purpose-built vessels, one off’s if you will. I strongly urge USCG to allow local inspectors to work with vessel owners to ensure they meet the intent of the rule. There is no one size fits all solution.
Proposed early warning, additional training, and passenger orientation all are a welcome addition to our current safety protocols. Having to reconstruct a berthing space that was constructed under approved specifications coupled with a flawless safety record spanning 40 years, will be challenging. 
I will also ask USCG conduct an economic analysis to understand the impact the proposed rule will have on the small passenger vessel industry. Altering construction to meet the rule as currently drafted will result in full vessel replacement in some instances; something todays economics simply do not support. In other instances, reductions in berthing will result in decreased capacities that will cause businesses to simply fail. Economic studies are available for the small passenger vessel fleet in California and should be referenced prior to rulemaking.
I trust you consider the above comments, and do not misinterpret them as placing profits before safety. My safety record as an owner and operator speaks for itself. I support evolving passenger safety yet at the same time am concerned many of us will also become victims of this avoidable tragedy.
Thank you,
Scott McDaniels

H&M Landing is home to the largest fleet of inspected Small Passenger Vessels nationwide.

I am writing today with comments on the Interim Rule on Fire Safety of Small Passenger Vessels. 

The events surrounding the vessel Conception on September 2, 2019 were tragic, yet avoidable. Complacency can be pinpointed as the culprit resulting in 34 fatalities making the event the worst maritime disaster in California waters since 1865. Complacency has no place in maritime trades, especially when lives are at stake and the safety of one’s vessel.

I have been a credentialed mariner since 1981. Having transported hundreds of thousands of passengers in my career, I do not make this statement lightly.


For the record, I am in support of the interim rule as it provides additional requirements with respect to enhanced fire detection, egress drills for passengers pre-voyage, enhanced fire suppression training for crews, watchman monitoring devices, and enhanced handling of flammable equipment such as rechargeable batteries and devices. All these additional requirements will further help to ensure the safety of passengers, crew, and vessel on any given voyage. However, I must state strongly, none of these additional requirements will ensure the safety of vessel and those onboard if they are not executed.

NTSB has concluded a contributing factor in the tragedy that occurred onboard the Conception was the lack of roving patrolman in the early morning hours when the fire broke out. There is an existing rule that states whenever passengers are present, a crewman must be designated as a roving patrolman at all times.

We can continue to reform, add, enhance, and impose additional rules, however; unless we are diligent mariners, unless we are prudent seaman, all the rules ratified and applied mean nothing unless they are followed.

This tragic event was one company’s failure to comply with existing regulations that is giving rise to the ratification of Small Passenger Vessel safety regulations.

I wish to further comment on “Construction and Arrangement” regulations as they are proposed for vessels with overnight accommodations. I draw back on the overall safe operation of our fleet as constructed and arranged. For the past 75 years, these vessels have had an excellent safety record in terms of access and secondary means of egress. Proposed language will not necessarily enhance egress. In some cases, it may in fact make secondary means of escape more challenging.

I strongly encourage USCG to provide guidance for local OCMI’s to work collaboratively with individual vessel owners to establish a responsive plan to comply with the regulations and help meet the intent of the rule. Simply eliminating or modifying berthing is not a one size fits all solution to what is hoping to be accomplished.


Further consideration must be given to the financial impact of the existing fleet and their ability to comply to the rule as written. Federal Register states that OMB has yet to conduct a cost analysis of these requirements. Recent economic data in California suggests the average new build ranges between $4.6m to $5.7m. It is recommended an economic study be commissioned regarding the financial impact of the rule to understand empirically how many companies and their employees will be forced out of business should the rule be adopted with no adjustment prior to implementation.

Moving forward, I support new vessel builds adopt the compliance path that meets the intent and rule as ultimately adopted.

I want to thank the NTSB for their investigative work. It shed accurate light on the events that led up to and tragically resulted in 34 lives lost. 

I wish to acknowledge USCG inspections nation wide for their immediate response post tragedy. Their swift response and willingness to corroborate with small vessel owners in the wake of this tragedy kept us all informed, aware, safe, and working as we all tried to make some sense of this avoidable tragedy.

Thank you,

Frank T. Ursitti

24 June 2022

To the USCG,

My name is Bob Valney and I own the Small Passenger Vessel Seabiscuit, as well as being  a licensed mariner for over 40 years. I operate vessels on the California coast and have transported thousands of people throughout my career.
I would like to comment on the above referenced docket number. I am in full support of additional safety measures such as additional crew training,  egress  drills and early detection systems. As far as construction & arrangement, it only makes sense for the local inspectors to work with each vessel as all are so different and what might work for one, might not work for another.

I feel there are ways to reach the intent of the rule and an equivalent level of safety by working together without putting an entire industry out of business as the cost of a new vessel starts in the 4 million dollar range. With this said, I feel there should be a financial impact report done as required.

Per the NTSB findings, the Conception tragedy happened as a result of no roving watch. This is not industry practice and an entire industry should not be penalized.

I look forward to working with our local Coast Guard inspectors to meet the intent of the rule and continue to provide a safe environment for our clients.

Sincerely,
Bob Valney

Ocean Odyssey is an 85’ Charter sportfishing vessel ported in San Diego, CA that has been owned by my family since 1995.  I appreciate the opportunity to provide public comment on the proposed rulemaking regarding fire safety on Small Passenger Vessels.
I am a second-generation credentialed mariner, with a career in sportfishing spanning my lifetime.  Since 1971 my parents have owned sportfishing vessels, prior to Ocean Odyssey.  All of these prior vessels are currently operational as fishing and diving passenger vessels in San Diego.  
Like my parents before me, I have seen the evolution of our fleet as well as enhanced safety measures implemented throughout the years. We have always supported safety in our industry, and our record speaks for itself. Our entire industry has an incredible record of safety when the number of passengers carried annually over the past 50 years is taken into consideration.
In citing the NTSB report and the Federal Register, it is stated human error is a causative factor in this event. Having not been onboard, and going by this report, I would agree, with no crewman on watch while passengers were present was a gross dereliction of duty and direct defiance of prudent seamanship and federal regulation.  As a professional mariner, my thoughts are with the families of those whose lives were lost in this avoidable tragedy.  
We have supported enhanced early warning systems such as unified smoke alarms, accountability for watch standers, additional fire suppression training for crew, and egress demonstrations for passengers.  The Ocean Odyssey was built to USCG standards with 2 points of egress per passenger berthing space.  The USCG needs to be more focused on the watch stander accountability and training than costly retrofits.  Without the early emergency detection via alarm or watch stander observation and the human reaction to said emergency, modified egress points will have little benefit.
Proposed regulations regarding construction and arrangement will cause many small businesses such as mine to go out of business simply due to our ability to comply with the way the rule is written.  Our vessels were built with means of escape, they have proven safe throughout the years.
Safety has always been paramount in my business. We simply feel that working with our local inspectors who know our vessels better than those drafting policy in a reactive manner, can create a comprehensive plan that meets or exceeds the intent of the construction and arrangement portion of this rule.
I ask USCG grant local inspectors the latitude to work with individual vessel captains and owners to satisfy the requirements of this rule with minimal financial impact while simultaneously ensure the safety of passengers and crew.  Thank you for this consideration.

Sincerely,

Dina Grivetto

Having very large areas of wind generators placed offshore that do not allow fishing access will have a negative impacts on local fishermen and their ability to fish for pelagic offshore species. 
The highly migratory species like Albacore migrate through the offshore areas off our coast and they can at times be localized in the proposed wind farm zone. Due to the size of the wind farm, that may totally exclude us from catching Albacore when they are available to catch.

I do not believe that having a no access zone around the wind farm will be of any great benefit as far as a security concern. I think the wind farm operators should be required to monitor the wind generators via video and alarms to detect any security issues that may arise. If you look at all of the wind farms in the mid-West that cover many square miles of potentially accessible land, there doesn't appear to be a big security problem.

Since the operators will be monitoring the wind generators they can assess any threats and respond accordingly. The response can be as simple as calling in a maintenance crew or in severe events, calling out the Coast Guard to prevent a major security or safety hazard. No real difference from any other marine emergency.

I think a more practical approach would be to allow smaller vessels under 100 feet in length to access the areas in between the wind generators and to prohibit the larger commercial freighters from the zone. 
I see the biggest problem as the potential for collisions with the wind generator platforms. Smaller vessels will have better maneuverability in between the platforms.
They will also cause less damage if any if they were to collide with the platforms.
Large commercial freighters will have a lot harder time avoiding collisions due to their reduced maneuverability. 
Examples of the ability of small vessels to safely access areas around platforms can be seen in the Gulf of Mexico and the major benefit they provide of fishing recreation there with little to no negative impacts.

Thank you for providing me the opportunity to give comments on this important issue.",,,,,,,

In regards to PAC-PARS study USCG-2021-0345-0070. Our West Coast based company operates a fleet of tugs and barges moving petroleum products up and down the West Coast into various ports. We comply with all ATBA's, National Marine Sanctuaries, current inbound/outbound TSS in effect at the present time.

In looking at the proposed Pacific Coast route, it appears to follow routing we already use on a fairly regular basis with a few changes to fit our needs. There are times during inclement weather that our vessels may need to deviate to an inshore area which raises the question of strict compliance with the proposed TSS. At times, our vessels may also need to run a weather course which could conflict with other traffic in the area using the same TSS.

Will this routing become mandatory for all users? How will there or will there be any VTS involvement? If inshore routing becomes necessary due to poor weather, how will notification be made of that intent and to whom? 

Industry appreciates the chance to comment on this potential change and we look forward to further exchange of ideas.

Recently I heard about “Fran”, a 17 year old humpback whale with a young calf, washed ashore with a fractured neck as a result of a ship strike. This should not have happened and we must do everything we can to prevent incidents such as this. 

Based on the best available science, I urge you to:
1. Move California coastal shipping fairways further offshore out of whale habitat to separate shipping from humpback and blue whale feeding areas along the California coast.
2. Reconfigure the San Francisco Bay shipping lanes, most specifically extending the northern shipping lane, to not end in the heart of a prime feeding area, and 
3. Implement mandatory speed limits of a maximum of 10 knots where vessel traffic and high densities of whales cannot be separated

Shipping traffic modifications have been well received all around the world. This is the right thing to do for a safer and healthier marine environment. 

We have a responsibility to protect these wonderful creatures and ensure they are around and thriving for generations to come. The ocean belongs to all and whenever feasibly possible, me must consider how we are affecting the ocean and it’s creatures, and if there is a better way to protect them we have a duty to do so.

Thank you for doing right by our whales.",,,,,,,

This is a tragic loss of much beloved whales that many californians and tourists alike will visit the area year after year to see returning whales. 

This is not only damaging a very fragile population of sentient beings crucial for a healthy ecosystem, but for the reputation of californian tourism, as well as that of the nation itself for it's protection of delicate wildlife.

I am concerned about permanent or semi-permanent wind energy structures impinging on the safety fairway or being located close to the edge of the fairway.  I am also concerned there is no separation zone as would be present in a TSS or any kind of zone between the fairway and potential projects.  This is a serious issue in the Gulf of Mexico south of Houston and the Sabine.  As a mariner I have personally dealt with many challenging and potentially dangerous navigational safety issues involving meeting, crossing, and overtaking in the fairways and not being able to maneuver outside of the fairway because of a capped wellhead or abandoned rig right on the edge.  This issue will be complicated by the presence of west coast fishing fleets occupying the fairway (as they have every right to do) and not having the COLREG privileges of being constrained by draft or restricted in ability to maneuver as assigned to deep draft vessels in channels or TSSs.
Respectfully,
Mark",,,,,,,

They include a pregnant blue whale female and her fully formed fetus, a juvenile humpback whale, and Fran, a 17 year old female with a 7-9 mo. calf, which has not been seen since her death. The calf may have also been killed by shipstrirke, but its carcass sank before reaching shore. Fran was a celebrity among whales, the most photographed along the California coast, and a favorite of whale watchers. She was healthy and fit at the time of her untimely death. Her skull was cracked on impact (photos attached), and her head was dislocated from her spine. This is a tragedy of enormous proportions. I have also photographed a young gray whale calf on its first northward migration from the calving lagoons in Baja to northern feeding grounds. That calf had its spine sliced all the way through by a squid boat fishing in the migration path as the calf and its mother approached Monterey Bay. Watching this mortally wounded calf struggle to swim, then photographing its carcass washed ashore two days later, was horrifically tragic.

If we cannot accommodate these intelligent, sentient mammals by moving our shipping lanes and requiring compulsory speed reductions through their feeding areas, we don't deserve to be on the ocean. 

A very small percentage of whales killed by shipstrike ever wash ashore. The true numbers are most certainly staggering. These whales do not deserve to die due to our lack of compassion, our greed and our inaction.

California benefits enormously from whale populations that have recovered from the whaling era, supporting a healthy whale watching industry AND serving as a critical part of a healthy marine ecosystem. But in California coastal waters, far too many whales are being needlessly killed by shipping traffic that can be separated from areas of high whale abundance or slowed down to more whale-safe speeds. These are the most magnificent animals on earth, being run over as road-kill at rates that would not be tolerated if it were not so out-of-sight and out-of-mind.

This should not have happened and must not continue. Based on the best available science, I urge you to:
 
1. Move California coastal shipping fairways further offshore out of whale habitat to separate shipping from humpback and blue whale feeding areas along the California coast

2.  Work with NOAA to reconfigure the San Francisco Bay shipping lanes, most specifically extending the northern shipping lane to not originate and end in the heart of a prime feeding area, and encourage large vessel traffic to enter and exit through the western approach to San Francisco Bay where ship strike risk is lower, and

3. Work with NOAA to implement mandatory speed limits of a maximum of 10 knots where vessel traffic and high densities of whales cannot be separated. Voluntary speed limits may get some engagement but… would parents be happy with school zones where ~40% of drivers zoomed past a school at 50mph because they didn’t feel like slowing down?
 
Shipping traffic modifications have been well received worldwide, the right thing to do for a safer and healthier marine environment. Thank you sincerely for doing the right thing for our whales and the economies that depend upon them.

Thanks for your consideration of this humane and common sense adjustment!

9/10/2022: Glacier Bay NP: Speed and course restrictions in whale waters are intended to reduce the disruption of feeding humpback whales and to lower the risk of whale/vessel collisions as authorized by Title 36 Code of Federal regulations Subpart N,13.1174 https://www.nps.gov/glba/learn/news/whale-waters-update-10sept2022.htm

NOAA Fisheries provides maps and coordinates to vessel operators indicating areas where right whales have been detected. Mariners are encouraged to avoid these areas or reduce speeds to 10 knots or less while transiting through these areas for 15 days. 

Right Whale Slow Zones are established around areas where right whales have been recently seen or heard; these areas are identical to Dynamic Management Areas (DMA) when triggered by right whale visual sightings but, they will also be established when right whale detections are confirmed from acoustic receivers. 
NOAA Fisheries announces Right Whale Slow Zones to mariners through its customary maritime communication media and displays any active zones below, with the most recent designation first. Reducing Vessel Strikes to North Atlantic Right Whales | NOAA Fisheries

State of Hawaii and Hawaii Superferry whale avoidance protocol: 90% of Humpbacks in Hawaii inhabit 100 fathoms or less. Ships to avoid 100 fathoms or less.  Bridge 2 active officers + 2 whale lookouts trained in whale behavior. Observation Equipment: Image stabilized binocular, Class 1 (eye safe) laser range/Berring finder. Night vision goggle for night operation. Electronic equipment: Forward-looking collision avoidance sonar, X band radar (Project Humpback 2002) Radar with automatic declutter, ATA,ARPA tracking aids. Avoidance: Actively seek and ID whales and track line ahead of vessel. Identify course and speed and calculate closest point of encounter. If within 500 m change course and speed. If whale is struck call National Marine Fisheries, USCG. Detailed report in 24 hours.
Hawaii Superferry on Whale Avoidance -

2022: During whale season, officials are recommending boaters voluntarily maintain a speed of 15 knots or less while operating in Hawaiian waters and a maximum speed of 6 knots if within 400 yards of a whale to reduce the risk of collision or disturbance. For the past year, representatives from Pacific Whale Foundation, National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration, the state Department of Land and Natural Resources Division of Boating and Ocean Recreation, the DLNR Division of Aquatic Resources, tour operators like Lahaina-based PacWhale Eco-Adventures, private boaters, fishers, and other community members have worked together on a set of “best practices” to keep both whales and vessels safe.

The endangered blue whale is found off the southern tip of Sri Lanka, and cargo ships steam right through its habitat. They can strike and kill the whales, which is why the decision of one shipping company matters. The Mediterranean Shipping Company, which is the world's largest shipping line, rerouted its ships. Blue whales live 70 to 80 years, and somewhere right now is a whale that will live a bit longer. Reducing ship strike by 95%. NPR report

Please work together to mitigate risk of vessel collision by moving California shipping lanes further offshore. Work with NOAA to establish shipping speeds and reconfigure San Francisco shipping lanes. Consider whale transit and congregation areas. We must protect our whales. A concerned citizen. Mahalo

Have you seen a whale in the wild?  I have seen humpbacks, pilot whales, orcas and gray whales off the west coast.  They are magnificent. That is why I think it is so important to define shipping routes and speed limits that support the safety of marine life while still supporting marine commerce. 

Today, shipping traffic is traveling in known areas of whale migrations and ships are traveling at speeds far too fast in these sensitive areas. The results are deadly for whales. Too many whales are needlessly run over by ships traveling too fast and too close to known whale areas. This is not acceptable when shipping lanes can be modified to be safe for both whales and man. I am asking you to:
 
1. Move coastal shipping fairways further offshore out of whale habitat to separate shipping from humpback and blue whale feeding areas, especially those along the California coast

2.  Work with NOAA to put a cap on speed limits in areas of high densities of whales.  

The ocean is the whale’s home. They do not have the option to move elsewhere. That is why I believe we need to modify shipping traffic rules to enable them to live in peace so future generations can experience these gentle giants.

California benefits enormously from whale populations that have recovered from the whaling era, supporting a healthy whale watching industry and serving as a critical part of a healthy marine ecosystem. But in California coastal waters, far too many whales are being needlessly killed by shipping traffic that can be separated from areas of high whale abundance or slowed down to more whale-safe speeds. These are the most magnificent animals on earth, being run over as roadkill at rates that would not be tolerated if it were not so out-of-sight and out-of-mind. In August, California’s most well-known whale, “Fran”, a 17 year old humpback with a 7-9 month old calf, washed ashore with a fractured neck resulting from a ship strike.

Voluntary speed limits may get some engagement but… would parents be happy with school zones where ~40% of drivers zoomed past a school at 50mph because they didn’t feel like slowing down?

The Port of Umpqua Commissioners appreciate the work completed by the United States Coast Guard regarding the Pacific Port Access Route Study. In the advisory role of the USCG to the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management we request that you high-light the navigation issues associated with wind turbines in the “Navigation Fairways” specified in PAC-PARS. Specifically, we want BOEM to adjust the Coos Bay Call Area Eastern boundary not to overlap the Coastal Fairway identified in PAC-PARS.

Additionally, we request that the USCG provide a west facing navigation fairway through the Coos Bay Call Area to the entrance of Winchester Bay. Winchester Bay is the home port for numerous commercial anglers (trawlers, crabbers, salmon and tuna trollers, and more) involved in the harvest of seafood. There are also many recreational anglers transiting in and out of Winchester Bay. Recreational boat traffic is particularly heavy in the summer months. There are two shipyards in the Winchester Bay and Reedsport, Oregon area: Fred Wahl Marine Construction and Reedsport Machine and Fabrication. These companies build and repair vessels which transit in and out of Winchester Bay, Oregon.

Our concern regarding navigation fairways is for safe transit through the Coos Bay Call Area. Radar commonly used by boaters is compromised by wind turbines. It’s hard enough to safely navigate in the fog common outside of Winchester Bay without having to worry about wind turbines. Thank you for your consideration.

In the advisory role of the USCG to the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management I am requesting that you high-light the navigation issues associated with wind turbines in the “Navigation Fairways” specified in PAC-PARS. Specifically, I want BOEM to adjust the Coos Bay Call Area Eastern boundary not to overlap the Coastal Fairway Zone identified in PAC-PARS.

Additionally, I am requesting that the USCG provide a west facing navigation fairway through the Coos Bay Call Area to the entrance of Winchester Bay. The requested navigation fairway could intersect the Coos Bay Navigation Fairway at a point due west of Winchester Bay. 

Winchester Bay is the home port for numerous commercial anglers (trawlers, crabbers, salmon, and tuna trollers, and more) involved in the harvest of seafood. There are also many fishing guides and recreational anglers transiting in and out of Winchester Bay. This recreational boat traffic is particularly heavy in the summer months.  The Salmon Harbor Marina is home to the Winchester Bay commercial fishing fleet and many recreational anglers.

There are also two boat building and repair businesses with vessels going in and out of Winchester Bay.  Fred Wahl Marine Construction, who specializes in building quality commercial vessels and Reedsport Machine and Fabrication. These marinas are working on large ocean vessels that do a lot of transit in and out of Winchester Bay. 

My main concern regarding navigation fairways is for SAFE transit through the Coos Bay Call Area. Radar commonly used by boaters is compromised by wind turbines. It’s hard enough to safely navigate in the fog common outside of Winchester Bay without having to worry about wind turbines. 

Thank you for your consideration.

I've also noticed that there are actually several whales that have been killed by ship strike, washing up on the shores of the Washington coast.  Are these the only ones, or are there many being struck and killed, and because they don't wash up on our shores, we're not aware of them?  (Out of sight, out of mind?)  Can these deaths be avoided?  

In conferring with others, it seems that there ARE measures that can be taken:

1. Move California coastal shipping fairways further offshore out of whale habitat to separate shipping from humpback and blue whale feeding areas along the California coast

2.  Work with NOAA to reconfigure the San Francisco Bay shipping lanes, most specifically, extend the northern shipping lane to originate and end OUTSIDE of the heart of the whales' prime feeding area, and encourage large vessel traffic to enter and exit through the western approach to San Francisco Bay where ship strike risk is lower.

We know that only a small percent of ship strikes are detected, and in most cases we cannot identify the individual whale killed. So in August when I identified Fran, California’s most well-known whale, the issue suddenly moved from being an abstraction of unknown numbers lost to something very personal. I had photographed Fran with her calf just a month before, and now there she was dead on a beach, with a broken neck and an orphaned calf. This should not have happened and must not continue. 

Shipping lanes currently run in effect through the kitchens and dining rooms of US west coast whales. The current proposal is an improvement, moving these lanes instead into what is in effect their living rooms. We can do better.

California benefits enormously from whale populations that have recovered from the whaling era, supporting a healthy whale watching industry and serving as a critical part of a healthy marine ecosystem.

Fran was the first humpback I ever learned to identify based on her tail fluke patterns. For years I was privileged to see her speckled black and white flukes rise above Monterey Bay on a number of occasions . She was always there, a familiar fin surfacing among the waves. The last time I saw her was when her broken body washed up in half moon bay. She was incredibly healthy. Her blubber layer was thick and her stomach was full. The only thing wrong was her fractured neck. If the boat that killed her had been further offshore or moving slower at the time of impact, Fran wouldn't have died. She was only 17. She could have lived so much longer and contributed numerous calves to the recovering humpback population on our coast. I know any modifications can be difficult to enact, but something has to be done to prevent further tragedies like Fran's death.",,,,,,,

It is a relatively minor inconvenience to us (humans) to detour a couple miles out of the way on shipping routes (small costs to companies relative to the safety of the whales and the health of the oceans that we all depend on). It is time we did the right thing, and not just think about the economic bottom line. We depend on healthy ecosystems, without whales, the marine ecosystems will crash.

Dear LCDR Conrad,

I appreciate the opportunity to comment on the Port Access Route Study (PARS). I come from a multigenerational fishing family that has been operating off the Oregon coast for over 40 years. I strongly support the new Shipping Safety Fairways off the coast of Oregon in their current form with no changes or reductions.  

With wind turbine development being considered outside the entrance to our vessel's home port, navigational safety is a major concern for me and my family. The wind turbine structures will greatly interfere and make it difficult to navigate safely through the industrial site during stormy and foggy conditions, they will also interfere with radar equipment making it impossible for the vessel operator to use and navigate through the site and return to its home port safely. With the potential loss of their radars, they will need to make a distress call to the coast guard for assistance to enter the bar safely. The lives of the crew aboard the distressed vessel along with the United States Coast Guard could be in danger, if a lifesaving rescue is needed. The likelihood of a collision with a wind turbine is more probable than not during a storm with gale force winds, high seas and big swells. The PARS is accurate and should be expedited for a final report before the floating wind industrial site has a WEA (Wind Energy Area) in place and the bidding to lease begins. The ability to safely navigate to port using the new Safety Fairway Routes will be critical for the safety of ocean users.

A new shipping container facility in Coos Bay is set to begin construction in the near future. I am worried that the facility will increase vessel traffic to and from our port. Congestion or bottlenecking at the entrance will occur as more container ships arrive and depart from the Coos Bay port, putting maritime users at risk. To reduce the impact of the new shipping container facility and the additional cargo ships crowding the bar entrance, the Safety Fairways must be installed as soon as possible for maritime safety.

Navigational Safety for all maritime users should take precedence over any new development being considered on or near any waterways. I am requesting that the Port Access Rout Study be left as is and that a final draft be submitted and approved as soon as possible.

Thank you for your time and conidiation,
Karie Silva

It is heartbreaking the regularity of whales killed by ship strikes. We need to do take action to reduce this threat. The feeding grounds of whales off the CA coast are directly in shipping lanes. This is literally a collision course! How hard should it be to regulate and enforce speed limits? We have speed limits for automobiles to protect people and we need to do this for our cetacean neighbors. Earlier in September I was on a boat crossing the Santa Barbara channel - the Captain stopped so we could all enjoy the wondrous humpbacks feeding; finally the Captain announced ""we must get going as we are directly in the shipping channel."" Yet the whales continued feeding, literally without any safety.  Recently one of the identified whales in the Monterey - SF area, named ""Fran"" was killed by a ship - her young calf, less than a year old became an orphan. Please - take these actions:

1. Move fairways further offshore out of whale habitat to separate shipping from humpback and blue whale feeding areas along the California coast.
2. Reconfigure the San Francisco Bay shipping lanes, most specifically extending the northern shipping lane, to not end in the heart of a prime feeding area, and
3. Implement mandatory speed limits of a maximum of 10 knots where vessel traffic and whale abundance cannot be separated. Voluntary speed limits may get some engagement but… ""would parents be happy with school zones where a percentage of drivers zoomed past a school at 50mph because they didn’t feel like slowing down?""

Thank you for these considerations - that have the support of so much of the public!

Re: Port Access Route Study: Docket number USCG-2021-0345.

To whom it may concern,
The idea of putting wind generators in the ocean in the depths that BOEM is planning, to me spells disaster. 
The unknown effects to the marine ecosystem are enough in itself to not go forward with the proposed BOEM plan. Once the trillions of dollars are spent and we then find out that our ocean and its ecosystem is negatively affected I believe they will not admit the wind generators are the cause.
The expense of it is outrageous. There are higher producing and cheaper avenues for electrical generation, like nuclear energy. This area should be examined thoroughly.  I greatly believe it is more dependable than wind.
If the wind generators were to be installed in the ocean, I feel there should be a north and south passageway for every port along the coast. Especially due to the great possibility of the large non-transit area off the Oregon Coast i.e., coast guard ships, cargo ships, plus fishing (commercial and non-commercial).

Respectfully,
Steve Thienes

The Oregon Coast Anglers appreciate the work completed by the United States Coast Guard regarding the Pacific Port Access Route Study. In the advisory role of the USCG to the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management we request that you high-light the navigation issues associated with wind turbines in the “Navigation Fairways” specified in PAC-PARS. Specifically, we want BOEM to adjust the Coos Bay Call Area Eastern boundary not to overlap the Coastal Fairway Zone identified in PAC-PARS.

Additionally, we request that the USCG provide a west facing navigation fairway through the Coos Bay Call Area to the entrance of Winchester Bay. The requested navigation fairway could intersect the Coos Bay Navigation Fairway at a point due west of Winchester Bay. Regarding Brookings Harbor, we request a navigation fairway from the entrance of Brookings Harbor Northwest through the Brookings Call Area.

The USCG PAC-PARS developed the navigation fairways using AIS and VMS tracking data. Many of the commercial trollers and none of the recreational boats transiting in and out of Winchester Bay, Coos Bay and Brookings Harbor are equipped with AIS or VMS equipment. Therefore, there is considerably more boat traffic in and around both the Coos Bay and Brookings Call Areas than is accounted for in PAC-PARS.

Winchester Bay is the home port for numerous commercial anglers (trawlers, crabbers, salmon and tuna trollers, and more) involved in the harvest of seafood. There are also many recreational anglers transiting in and out of Winchester Bay. Recreational boat traffic is particularly heavy in the summer months. There are two boat building and repair marinas in Winchester Bay, Fred Wahl Marine Construction and Reedsport Machine and Fabrication. These marinas build and repair large ocean vessels which transit in and out of Winchester Bay. The Salmon Harbor Marina is home to the Winchester Bay commercial fishing fleet and many recreational anglers.

Our concern regarding navigation fairways is for safe transit through the Coos Bay and Brookings Call Areas. Radar commonly used by boaters is compromised by wind turbines. It’s hard enough to safely navigate in the fog common outside of Winchester Bay and Brookings Harbor without having to worry about wind turbines. Navigation fairways clear of wind turbines and fixed buoys through the Call Areas would provide safe channels for boats to navigate. Thank you for your consideration.",,,,,,,

Subject: Implement strong protections for vulnerable marine species along the West Coast -- Port Access Route Study: The Pacific Coast from Washington to California (Document ID: USCG-2021-0345-0070)

To the U.S. Coast Guard Pacific Area Commander Vice Admiral A.J. Tiongson:

I’m writing to encourage the Coast Guard to consider the impacts of vessel noise, pollution, and collisions on endangered Southern Resident killer whales, fin whales, blue whales, humpback whales, and other vulnerable marine species as a part of the Port Access Route Study for the Pacific Coast from Washington to California.

West Coast waters are home to many valuable marine species that are under serious threat from shipping traffic—from wastewater and noise pollution to injury and death from ship strikes. The Coast Guard must consider requiring ships to do the following:

* Move ships further offshore to work to avoid whale habitat, feeding grounds, and areas of upwelling.
* Reduce ship speeds to actively reduce noise from ships and help avoid potential contact/striking marine mammals.
* Implement real time active management of shipping to reduce the likelihood of impacts on marine mammals.
* Use the Whale Safe Tool (whalesafe.com).

A comprehensive West Coast Port Access Route Study and any resulting ship routing measures need to take into account local concerns and protect wildlife. It also needs to be adaptable and take into account changing weather, wildlife migration patterns, geopolitical situations, and changing shipping activity. Millions of seabirds, fish, and marine mammals, including endangered whales, will continue to be threatened by shipping up and down the West Coast unless the Coast Guard takes real steps to increase protections for marine life.

I look forward to seeing the Coast Guard act to protect the rich waters of the West Coast by properly regulating shipping industry traffic and pollution. Thank you for your consideration of my comments. Please do NOT add my name to your mailing list. I will learn about future developments on this issue from other sources.

Sincerely,
Christopher Lish

Proposed Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary (NMS) Area to be Avoided (ATBA) Extension: 
Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division (NAWCWD) Point Mugu Sea Range (PMSR) has significant concern about the proposed Channel Island NMS. A direct impact of 6% to DoD Warning and Special Use areas used commonly for DoD and International programs should not be discounted.  The PAC PARS route study suggests that the current dispersed traffic pattern is not advantageous to stated concerns. The proposed traffic route west of Channel Island NMS ATBA will create a “bottle neck” of marine traffic and push resulting concentration of range foulers into an often used, open-ocean area utilized by major DoD programs of record. This change will have lasting negative impacts on major DoD operations in the proposed area forcing operations to less commonly used geographic locations.
2. The boundaries of PMSR are imprecise in the document.  Most importantly, the entire Warning Area 537 (W-537) is missing which causes the range to appear non-contiguous, when in fact it is one large contiguous area.
3. There are two fairways which run roughly east-west in the vicinity of Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary (NMS).  The southern fairway runs in a location that has sometimes been referred to as an alternative to the Santa Barbara Traffic Separation Scheme (TSS), which is problematic to the PMSR, and has never been endorsed despite its occasional appearance in published charts.  This fairway diverts traffic from the TSS and runs it south of Channel Islands NMS, which then places traffic into the heart of a section of PMSR that is very highly utilized.  This is compounded by the voluntary ATBA west of Channel Islands NMS, placing the vessel traffic that then turns north further into a high usage section of PMSR.  The effect of this fairway routing is likely to result in a significantly higher number of vessels fouling the range, or at the least requiring notification and rerouting which would cause operational delays.  Additionally, the purpose and benefits of this southern fairway are not clear.  Likewise, the purpose of the fairway to the north of Channel Islands NMS is also unclear and has undesirable routing for PMSR as it will cause vessel traffic to transit through highly used portions of the PMSR which in turn will cause similar issues.
4. There is no route given for those vessels that cannot utilize the identified coastwise (north-south) fairway, for example liquid bulk tankers who are following the recommendation to remain 50 nm offshore.  Recommend that an alternate route be developed for those vessels so that the range has some predictability and that mariners have a well-defined alternate.
5.	Although discussed, it is unclear if adequate thought has been put into the planned and likely future Wind Energy Areas (WEAs) in the central coast region.  Off shore WEAs in this area represent a large portion of the likely build-out in the short- to mid-term required to meet the state's offshore wind production goals.  Thorough planning is required to ensure that any fairway developed is compatible with those goals, and that the planning takes into account the undesirability of pushing vessel traffic further westward, where it could introduce operational constraints on the PMSR.

The OSCF agree with the Pacific Fisheries Management Council (PFMC) recommendation that Navigation Fairways be added for Winchester Bay through the BOEM Coos Call Area and to the Port of Brookings through the BOEM Brookings Call Area. Our concern regarding navigation fairways is for safe transit through the Coos Bay and Brookings Call Areas.

We also recommend that the Coos Bay Call Area eastern boundary be adjusted to not overlap the Coastal Fairway Zone identified in the PAC-PARS. Thank you for your consideration.",,,,,,,

NPRWs’ population is estimated to be 30 whales off the coast of North America.  All the sightings of NPRWs south of Canada from the past thirty years have occurred in close proximity to the proposed fairways or within the existing traffic separation scheme.  NOAA recognizes ship strike to be a potential cause of mortality to NPRWs and vessel noise to be a likely disturbance to the whales.  The current process should consider mitigation measures for the whales such as vessel slow downs and rerouting of shipping lanes.  The population of NPRWs is so small that harm to one individual could be devastating to the entire species.  

Also present in the area considered are the endangered Southern Resident killer whales.  There is overlap between the Southern Resident killer whale’s critical habitat and the navigation area under consideration.  Much like North Pacific right whales, Southern Resident killer whales are at risk from ship strike and vessel noise. Their protection should be considered when designating shipping routes.  

Lastly, we would like to point out that the existing traffic separation scheme at the entrance to the Strait of Juan De Fuca crosses directly over Swiftsure Bank.  Swiftsure Bank is an important feeding area for Southern Resident killer whales, many different populations of humpback whales and was the location of the most recent sighting of a North Pacific right whale in Washington state.  It is our opinion that having vessels transit this area without a speed restriction recklessly endangers the whales using this area and that vessel slowdowns or moving the existing lanes should be considered.

Attached is a map overlaying NPRW sightings within the area under consideration.

Thank You,
Kevin Campion and Kate Hruby

Please review my comments as below

2 a
Us development of WIG craft is on one company Regent Air in Boston, having one first 1/4 scale demonstrator, designed as an amphibious aircraft, rather than an optimized WIG craft. Wallaby Fabrications in Florida, are able to start production of full scale WIG work boats for service crew transfer to offshore platforms and wind mills in 12 weeks from now. In the remainder of the world there is already WIG boats in production like ARON flying ship of South Korea,  Airfish 8 of Singapore and one odd Chinese product.

2b
Puffin 5 from DrAGOnflydesign and built by Wallaby fabrications in Florida. It is expressively designed for transfer of service crews to offshore platforms and windmills. It is equiped to be able to hook on to and dock to the standard ladder arrangement for ship docking, also at adverse conditions with wave heights of 2 m.

2c 
In our minds, the relevant method for a WIG craft to dock to an offshore platform or windmill would be using the docking arrangement meant for maritime vessels. The notion of categorizing WIG crafts as maritime vessels makes entirely sense in every way, and to keep them away from every tendency of moving them back into the aviation realm makes no sense at all. It will instead kill all development on WIG:s in the US. 

Again the Puffin 5 WIG work boat is capable of operating routes to offshore platforms.

2d

Current WIG crafts are all smaller size, our present Puffin 5 WIG workboat is only of 5 m length, but it still carries 4 people completely smooth at a 100 knots speed. We have also made a concept study on a WIG ROPAX ferry, together with Griffon Hovercraft and one ferryline, which would be able to carry 30 big rigs along the full distance of the east or west coast respectively at a speed of 120 knots. It would preferably be using Vartsilaas zero carbon ammonia fueled engines. This way, taking all that long haul traffic of the roads and as well, everybody winning on it economically. They would be strictly type A WIG crafts, very much analogues to a hovercraft in their behavior and operation, but much faster and much more efficient.

2e
WIG crafts will be able to manage adverse weather conditions much better as compared to SES crafts or hovercrafts. Also, they are fast enough to fulfill a crossing within time limits for very reliable weather forecasts.

2f
We will be manufacturing the smaller WIG work boats as any other work boat. There is extra costs for the air engine and propeller though. The larger WIG crafts will be manufactured like a hovercraft and at a similar cost level. We would possibly be able to partner up with a US builder of hovercrafts, to have the products sold to US customers produced in the US.

3a

We would need an order for the Puffing 5 WIG work boat to send this as a demonstrator to you. 

3b 
We would be able to supply in about 12 weeks after receiving the order. 

4
If the US wish to be in the front line, or even taking part on exploiting this technology, it would only be by taking hands off of any regulation having to do with aviation in relation to WIG crafts. Any such regulation will kill all such development in the US, while other countries will be rushing to it. Rather let go of the C category and those that are designed in any way like an aircraft, to be able to reach higher altitude, they loose very very much of the potential efficiency advantage they would have if they were to be designed entirely as a WIG craft. Wing geometry and and wing profile for an optimal WIG craft is dramatically different from that of an aircraft. A compromise is a lousy mix craft, not really efficient and not really flying either. 
5 Just don´t regulate and kill it, other nations won´t! Let it stay entirely as for other maritime vessels on all terms!  

6 WIG ROPAX ferries will potentially be taking all long haul big rig and car traffic of the roads on routes along both the east and the west coasts and so, such traffic becoming very big business operations as well as reducing delivery times, CO"" emissions and overall costs.
7a
It should be equal to what ever credentials neccesary for operating any other boat or ship of that size and type of operation, nothing else! 
7bcdfg
Airman credentials should have nothing to do with WIG craft. The relevant experience, except for maritime navigation, would then be experience of steering a  hovercraft.

    The USCG has operated many various helicopter, fixed wing aircraft, and seaplanes in many operations. Corrosive environments and the lack of funding prior to 9/11 lead to the removal of all of the amphibious assets. The last of those was the HH-3 Pelican helicopter. Other remarkable assets were recovered from the bone yard. Refurbished and returned to service in the USCG. RG-8 Condor, and the E2C Hawkeye were extremely much too effective. Their programs were cancelled. 

  Returning the USCG to amphibian aircraft is a necessity, vital to the national security of the USA. The effects of 3 Sea Stryder's aircraft alone operating at low level in-ground effect flight operations modified with 360-degree thermal imaging. Integrated with tactile air to ground radar systems would drastically affect the drug trade.

 
   There are multiple in-ground effect aircraft on the market. Some are feasible for USCG missions. Example: Operational area from the Keys to the Caribbean. One of the most remarkable aircraft designs in particular has the ability to transition from boat to in-ground effect, and to fix wing flight. The Sea Stryder has A ceiling limit of 10,000 feet with a max speed of 250 Knots. The aircraft can easily be modified for small boat and boarding team deployment, or AUOF arial use of force. 6000 lb maximum takeoff weight, a range of 600 to 1200 nm, & a cruise velocity of at least 200 mph at any altitude up to 10,000 ft maximum operational altitude. It boasts a takeoff distance from water of less than 1/3 that of contemporary seaplanes under identical weight, wind and wave conditions.

SeaStryder features:
Multi-role (seaplane, airplane, ground-effect vehicle)
Efficient
Value-add features and functionality
One of a kind utility
Made in Canada with Canadian/US patents
SeaStryder is currently a concept craft.

SPEAR HEAD VESSEL: manufactured by Austal in Mobile, AL. Could easily be modified to recover, deploy the SeaStryder

I have been involved in the WIG community for over 20 years, and worked with the German WIG technologist Hanno Fischer through my Hypercraft Associates venture.

It is timely that the Coast Guard reviews WIG capabilities as there are two US ventures in WIG underway: Pacific Seaflight with the HW20 of German heritage, and Regent with their own design electric proposal.

WIG craft maximise their efficiency by flying close to the water surface.  They lend themselves to deployment in coastal, inter-island, estuary or inland waterway where the sea states are favourable.  Offshore sea states may rule-out WIG, and necessitate service by some other kind of vessel.  Nevertheless the case for WIG where it is deployed 'in its element' is a strong one.   Domestic locations such as the Bahamas and Seatle are examples of where WIG would work.  The opportunity for a US based commercial manufacturer of WIG craft would to be to develop technology superiority which can then be used to serve an export market in those parts of the world where the conditions are ideal, e,g. East Asia (Gulf of Thailand, Malacca Strait…), Persian Gulf, Red Sea, Adriatic Sea.  Therefore, when considering the value of WIG in the US it is important look beyond domestic market application and consider the global export market potential.

I think that because it is strictly temporary and specifically for the safety of all boaters and observers, that the rulemaking is necessary. Because of the extreme speed that these vessels will be traveling at, if there were to be an incident where a collision occurred, there is a very high likelihood that all participants involved would be killed. Traveling at these high speeds is dangerous for those who aren’t involved in this event. By allowing the Coast Guard to establish these regulations temporarily in the portion of the Hudson River specifically between Hudson River Lighted Buoy 202 and Hudson River Light 204 for the event you are ensuring that everything is being done to secure the safety of all participants and observers involved. The coast guard’s main job is to regulate US waters with a main goal of protecting the US naval vessels. Because of the fact that the event is taking place in a location that is utilized by naval vessels, it deems the coast guard responsible for protection. In the case of personal freedom colliding with public safety, which is occurring in this event, safety should always be the main concern and come first. 
Section III discusses that the regulation would prohibit any persons or boats not involved in the Horsepower on the Hudson event from entering, transiting through or remaining within the designated area. I think that this rule is especially important for those who are not even aware of the event taking place. It would be extremely dangerous if a vessel attempted to pass through during the event just because they were unaware. Like I previously stated as well, a collision in this case would be highly likely to involve multiple fatalities because of the high speed of these vessels. So, it is critical that a proper regulation be set in place by the Coast Guard in order to prevent this from happening. In addition to the blockade, the Coast Guard providing notice of the event and blockage to Mariners also increases the likelihood that they will be aware of the event and no hiccups will occur. In the Regulatory Planning and Review section, it is stated that this rule has not yet been designated “significant regulatory action.” I think that it is extremely important that this rule be passed in order to ensure safety of all persons involved. I think that it is also significant to highlight that this rule isn’t hindering any water transportation significantly because local waterway users will be notified ahead of time by the Coast Guard in order to make alternate routes of travel, as well as the fact that an alternate route will be open for transit. I think it is especially significant to emphasize the fact that this ruling will not significantly impact small businesses as discussed in Impact on Small Entities section. As stated, this is extremely temporary, and another route is still available for these vessels to take. Although this cost is minor, is will still exist. The small businesses surrounding the event should not have to suffer due to the regulation taking place to protect safety. There should be a fee installed to the Club in order to take care of the financial hit taken by these small businesses that are not at all associated with the Horsepower on the Hudson event. 
 In conclusion, there are very few reasons that this ruling would cause any harm, but the safety measures that it will carry out are critical. I highly support passage of this regulation in order to protect the safety and well-being of all involved in the Horsepower on the Hudson event.",,,,,,,

and predict changes in the Earth’s environment and conserve and manage coastal and marine resources to meet the Nation’s economic, social, and
environmental needs. Success in a global economy is linked not only to the ability to respond or react to events but to anticipate and forecast them. Understanding the ocean and atmosphere is essential to sustaining the United States’ environmental and economic health. Two of NOAA's 4 mission goals are related to this study: 1) Protect, restore, and manage the use of coastal and ocean resources through an ecosystem approach to
management. and 2) Support the Nation’s commerce with information for safe, efficient, and environmentally
sound transportation. NOAA's Office of Coast Survey offers to support USCG in this study effort by providing data including but not limited to the follow factors:  
-The Gulf of Maine serves as critical habitat to many protected species. NOAA has seasonal management areas North Atlantic right whale vessel speed regulations (50 CFR § 224.105). 
-Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary is located completely within federal waters. The 842-square-mile (682-square-nautical-mile) marine protected area stretches from three miles south of Cape Ann to three miles north of Cape Cod. It is approximately 21 miles from Boston to the sanctuary's western border. Historically important as a fishing ground, New England's only national marine sanctuary now reigns as a premier whale watching destination and continues to support commercial and recreational fishing.
-The commercial and recreational fishing industry and the routes into the approximately 50 communities which are highly dependent on fishing. AIS under represents fishing activity; VMS data can be used to better represent fishing activity (https://www.northeastoceandata.org/data-explorer/?commercial-fishing|vessel-activity).
-Critical Infrastructure such as Department of Transportation's Marine Highway Routes, Federally authorized channels maintained by USACE, ferry routes, overhead and submarine cables, tunnels and bridges",,,,,,,

It actually seems amazing to me that a private company can be allowed to take over, for their own purposes, probably one of the most used sections of the Columbia River.  I can't imagine you allowing me to do the same.  Is there any benefit to all of us to allow this?  I don't see any mention of this.  In addition, it sets a precedent for others that would likely require you to allow them to use a section of the river for their own purposes.  Who know what else may be proposed by others.  I'd love to test the lures in my boat and cut off all fishing boats from a stretch of the river myself so I can do a scientific test.  Let's say you decide to approve their request.  Then I'd want you to charge them an appropriate rate for this use that takes into consideration all those who are using that part of the river and the value of that adverse impact.  I'd say this would be a significant amount, and you should also charge for your time to figure all this out.",,,,,,,

The Columbia is a river under threat. Atypically low snow packs in the mountains that feed the Columbia will likely result in lower water levels and reduced water releases in support of salmon and other Columbia fisheries this year. To add to the stress on the river is unconscionable. When NOAA fisheries refuses to allow piling vibration except for a short window in the autumn, how on earth can a days of sonic attack and 200 mph speed testing be permitted? This doesn’t make sense. 

I strongly argue against any rule making that permits such an obscene intrusion upon our threatened Columbia River. 

Thank you.

Also, I think that the precautions taken for people potentially being near these ships are appropriate because of the non-maneuverability of these ships. Lastly, I think that it is good that the rule takes into account people needing to move around it when it's in a harbor/slow-moving area.",,,,,,,

This distance would also provide enough room for the helmsman of the ship to avoid any other vessels that might be around the ship. With out this rule there could be a potential disaster.",,,,,,,

I fully support the creation and implementation of safety zones around the tall ships participating in the 2022 Tall Ships Challenge. As a resident of Cleveland, Ohio, I am extremely excited for the Tall Ships Challenge to return to the city after 3 years and am looking forward to watching the event with my family in July. Because of the fact that there will likely be thousands of spectators, it is essential that this rule is approved so that the Coast Guard can ensure complete safety for both the participants and spectators. However, I feel that to maximize the safety of all individuals and spectators, the safety zone should be expanded to include 200 yards of a tall ship. I know many friends and family members who live on Lake Erie and frequently take paddleboards, kayaks, and jet skis on the lake, so it is important to me that people like them are protected during this year's Tall Ships Challenge. I also appreciate that the Coast Guard took into account this proposed rule's affect on small businesses and entities and deduced that it ""would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities."" Overall, I recommend that the safety zones be expanded to 200 yards within the ships to ensure safety of all citizens.

Currently, I have had to wait for up to 45 minutes on the railroad bridge to open if I happen to approach the bridge when the horn is sounding to start lowering the bridge.  If I have bad luck on my outbound journey and again on my homebound trip, this can easily exceed an hour of wait time.  Given that you are trying to compromise between boat, car and train traffic, I understand the desire to have a schedule.  In my opinion, only offering 15 minutes per hour for boat transit is not a fair compromise and is much more likely to negatively impact boaters over train and cars.  The river was there before either of those bridges and it is unfair for those that enjoy the river and purchased properties west of the bridge to suffer so much more than train traffic.  Furthermore, enhancements to improve the speed of the train draw bridge could help but doesn't appear to be part of this proposed regulation.  The marine industry is a very important part of our local and state economy and this industry will definitely suffer if limited to only being open 15 minutes.  I watch the boat traffic that heads east and west along the south fork and transits through these bridges and having non-local boaters not being fully aware of the exact schedule will result in long wait times.

As a boater it is not uncommon to wait upwards of an hour for the bridge to open.  That means police or coast guard vessel that may be responding to an emergency are stuck.  Additionally, once the train bridge opens, dozens of impatient and frustrated boaters are trying to get under the bridge at the same time.  Just last week we waited for the bridge to open for over an hour, there was no train during that hour, the bridge was just in the down position.  It is ridiculous that in this day and age there is no way for a boater to know the schedule for the bridge, you never know when it will be lowered and worse, you never know how long it will be down.  It has gotten to the point that i need to plan a 30-60 minute wait into my commute back to our home.  Boaters know that at times they'll need to wait on bridges, In my opinion, the bridge should be mandated to remain in the open position for at least 30 minutes out of every hour.  The bridge is over 100 years old, the area west of the bridge is affluent and growing, it is unbelievable that no one is addressing the concerns of hundreds or thousands of boaters.

With the existing schedule you can observe large congregations of boats waiting on the bridge. There is a strong current in the area which makes it difficult for some vessels to hold position, and this gets worse as congestion limits manouvering. 

15 minute may not allow for sufficient time for an orderly and safe passage of all vessels waiting. And will create an unreasonable vehicular backup on the road. 

I do think the vehicular bascule bridge schedule should match the railroads. I've personally invested 1 vessel incident, where a sailboats mast was broken due to the railroad bridge closing while the vehicle bridge was open and calling for the vessel to pass. I am aware of several similar incidents. As these incidents occur on recreational vessels, without licenced mariners, and inexperienced operators it's likely that these incidents are never reported to the USCG and the USCG has no knowledge.

But seems our local officials caved and we’re stuck with a 100 year old rusty relic as our “traffic light” on the water. Absolute shame!
This bridge serves as a MAJOR thoroughfare for not only the 10’s of thousands of people that live on the west side of the bridge, but it’s the ONLY route to Lake Okeechobee and the west coast of Florida, for people on the East side of the bridge. Also, many of us seek shelter from hurricanes by taking our boats west through the locks, which adds an entirely new level of boat traffic during those events.
A fair compromise can be reached for boaters, cars and trains. Please help be our voice to get this done so Palm City, Stuart and Jensen continue to be the beautiful and thriving “gems” we all moved here for!",,,,,,,

•	A schedule such as this reduces the appeal of living upriver of this bridge, forcing potential homeowners interested in boating to look elsewhere. This will essentially devalue all properties upriver of the bridge and almost all of Palm City Florida.
•	Massive boat traffic jams will occur, causing a hazard to navigation, accidents and potential injury.
•	This schedule will also hurt local businesses such as marinas & restaurants upriver of the bridge, as it will reduce the number of boats interested in transiting the bridge to patronize their facilities. Ultimately, this will cause a loss of jobs in the area.
•	What is the potential environmental impact to marine life by creating massive traffic jams on the water waiting for a bridge to open only 15 minutes of every hour?

It's my understanding that Bright line is trying to work out a schedule to only allow the train bridge to open only 15 minutes per hour. Obviously the Roosevelt bridge is not going to stay open for that 15 minute time frame so this proposed schedule is going to make passage through this area virtually impossible UNLESS the Roosevelt Bridge goes back to an on demand schedule and the train bridge can remain open for 30 minutes and not 15 minutes.

I have a boat on the west side of the Roosevelt Bridge which requires the railroad bridge to open.  This is a dangerous event with the old Roosevelt Bridge opening 2 times an hour during the week days and 3 times per hour on weekends.  Many of the boaters going through this narrow passage have limited knowledge of boater rights of way or how to control their boat in strong winds and currents.  This makes for dangerous transits given the narrowness of the existing railroad bridge.  Brightline is proposing opening the railroad bridge for 15 minutes per hour which will force too many boats through this passage during this limited period.  The bridge needs to maintain its current schedule of opening on the half hour during the week and on the hour, 20 and 40 after on weekends.  This limits the length of time the Roosevelt Bridge needs to stay open and the number of boats passing through with each opening.  Any less opening puts boater safety in jeopardy as more boats with be jammed into the narrow railroad bridge opening and more boats will be holding longer in the tight passage to the bridge.  

An alternate, would be to build a new railroad bridge which would be wide enough for 2 boats to pass safely side by side.  It is my understanding that this alternative may be cost prohibitive. .  ",,,,,,,

I firmly believe that this is a typical ""bait and switch"" from our local government and the Brightline (BL) corporation.  This was sold to our city as a convenient way to travel to and from our city of Stuart to West Palm Beach, Ft. Lauderdale, and Miami to our south and Orlando to our north.  In return BL, promised to raise and replace the archaic bridge that crosses our iconic waterway.  Apparently, once the deal was done, the cost for replacement has now, magically, become too prohibitive to replace, and now want to ""improve"" the existing structure.  This would be fine if there was a reasonable plan to keep the bridge open for marine traffic for a reasonable amount of time per hour.  15 min per hour is woefully inadequate as this would create very dangerous bottleneck conditions with boaters trying to race to get through the bridge during these short windows.  We need to find a better alternative to safely allow boaters to traverse the bridge and must be more than a very short 15 min period per hour.  Please reject this ridiculously short hourly window and increase the openings to meet the large demand of your boating community.

Your commitment to keep us safe is very much appreciated and provides comfort knowing the Coast Guard is there for us in times of need.

The puzzle regarding the 97 year old railroad bridge is a complex problem that will greatly affect the boaters that must pass under it as well as any commercial trains that must pass over it.  Below are my responses to the posted questions along with my recommendation for a long-term and short-term solution.

(1) Do you currently transit through the FEC Railroad Bridge crossing the Okeechobee Waterway, mile 7.4, at Stuart, Florida?
Yes

(2) How often do you transit this waterway?
At least once every two weeks, multiple times a week on some occasions.

(3) If railway traffic impedes your navigation of this area, how long are you normally delayed?
Up to 30 minutes including time waiting on the bridge, time to get in line, and time in boater traffic.  

(4) How would you propose to regulate the balance of railway and maritime traffic in this area?

The long-term solution is to build another bridge.  The current bridge is nearing 100 years old and the overall visible condition, rust, scaling, loose wires, and damage to the guard rails is concerning.  Building a taller and stronger bridge to accommodate the growing population of boaters and trains is the optimal solution.

To determine a short-term solution, I strongly urge decision makers to avoid conducting a live trial-and-error experiment with 15-minute openings.  This could cause unnecessary collisions, property damage, bodily harm, and potential loss of life.
Instead, I recommend conducting a virtual trial-and-error exercise by hiring an industrial engineering firm that specializes in queuing theory and stochastic process simulation.

The firm should collect boat traffic data prior to making any changes to the current operating schedule.  After the data is collected, a simulation model should be developed to understand the impact a 15-minute window will have.  Some of the questions that can be answered with a simulation model include:

1.	How long will boaters have to wait in line?

2.	How long will the line be?

3.	How long will it take for all waiting boaters to pass?

4.	Can the entire line be cleared in 15 minutes or will the bridge be closed before all boats pass?  This will cause some to wait an additional 45 minutes. How many times will this happen?  How many boaters will this happen to?

5.	What will happen if all boaters change their arrival times to sync up with bridge openings?  How many boats will accumulate at bridge? Will there be enough space in calm and rough waters?

6.	What impact will varying degrees of boat traffic have?
a.	On Holidays?
b.	During Peak Season?
c.	During Slow season?
d.	What impact will population growth have?

7.	What impact will a 15-minute window have on train operations? What happens if the window changes to 30 minutes? 45 minutes?  On demand??

I recommend 30 days of boat traffic should be collected in a summer month during the slow season, 30 days collected during peak season, and data collected on a peak holiday weekend.  Critical data points include:

1.	Number of boats passing under the bridge
2.	Vessel length and beam
3.	Speed
4.	Distance between boats
5.	Beam of boats where operators choose to traverse simultaneously with oncoming traffic
6.	Beam of boats where operators must/choose to traverse single file 
7.	The timestamp of each occurrence 
a.	the bridge is closed to boat traffic
b.	the bridge is opened to boat traffic
c.	when each vessel passes through the waterway
d.	when each the vessel arrives to the bridge.
   
(5) What challenges have you experienced when transiting this area due to these bridges and/or railway activity?
Because the waterway is only 48 feet wide, I avoid passing through simultaneously when a larger boat is coming through or if the current makes navigation sloppy.
Another challenge is waiting for the bridge to open when the current is high which makes it difficult to hold position while waiting.  
Lastly, when the bridge finally opens there is a lot of jockeying for position with high risk for collisions.  More boats with less time will only exacerbate this problem.

(6) Is a 15-minute hourly opening schedule sufficient for marine traffic? If not, please explain why.
I feel 15 minutes is not enough time.  However, the only safe way to be sure is to develop a quantitative simulation model.  Again, I’m strongly against doing a live trial and error experiment.

(7) Should the SR 707 (Dixie Hwy) Bridge opening schedule mirror the operating schedule of the FEC Railroad Bridge?
No, not an identical schedule.  The train bridge should be open more frequently since there are more smaller boats that do not have to wait on the Dixie Hwy Bridge.  I do believe that anytime the Dixie Hwy Bridge is open, the train bridge should be open as well.

15 minutes an hour is excessively low and restrictive to free navigation of this busy waterway.

And there will many minutes per hour that the train bridge will not be in use.

It is the year 2022.  All train bridges should have been moved inland or rebuilt to allow free passage at least half a century ago.  Having these 100+ year old structures looming collapse at the next hurricane and blocking free passage is absurdity.

NO FURTHER RESTRICTIONS to navigable waters is acceptable.

Furthermore, the USCG, much like the US Army Corp of Engineers should NOT have such authority, since they obviously exercise minimum or no oversight; and do not represent the citizens their omnipotent decisions affect.

§ 117.317 Okeechobee Waterway.
(c) Florida East Coast Railroad bridge, mile 7.4 at Stuart. The draw shall operate as follows:
(3) When a train approaches the bridge, the navigation lights go to flashing red and a horn sounds four blasts, pauses, and then repeats four blasts. After an eight minute delay, the draw lowers and locks, providing the scanning equipment reveals nothing under the draw. The draw remains down for a period of eight minutes or while the approach track circuit is occupied.

8 minutes (first delay) + 4 minutes (bridge lowering) + 8 minutes = 20 minutes (before the train even enters the approach track—that trek takes approximately 10 minutes).  Consequently, a single train passage consumes nearly 30 minutes before the train physically crosses the bridge. On average, a train passage takes 10-15 minutes.  Then raising the bridge, which takes 4+ minutes.  In summary, that’s 8+4+8+10+15+4 = 49 minutes for ONE TRAIN PASSAGE.

(1) Do you currently transit through the FEC Railroad Bridge crossing the Okeechobee Waterway, mile 7.4, at Stuart, Florida?  YES

(2) How often do you transit this waterway? MIN. 4-6 TIMES PER WEEK

(3) If railway traffic impedes your navigation of this area, how long are you normally delayed?  20 MINUTES FOR ONE TRAIN, 45-60 MINUTES IF A DOUBLE TRAIN.

(4) How would you propose to regulate the balance of railway and maritime traffic in this area?  PEAK TRAFFICKED MARITIME TIMES SUCH AS WEEKENDS, HOLIDAYS, AND WEEKDAY MORNINGS SHOULD HAVE LARGER WINDOW OF TIME THAT BRIDGE IS OPEN TO REDUCE HAZARDS AND ACCIDENTS.  REMAINING MODERATE TO LOW MARITIME TRAFFIC SCHEDULE SHOULD ALOT FOR MORE FREQUENT BRIDGE OPENINGS FOR RAIL. 

(5) What challenges have you experienced when transiting this area due to these bridges and/or railway activity?  DURING RAIL BRIDGE OPENINGS OM CURRENT SCHEDULE, BOAT TRAFFIC IS ALREADY CONGESTED WHICH MAKES NAVIGATING THE BOTTLENECK AT BRIDGE DIFFICULT AND DANGEROUS.  ADD IN THE STRONG CURRENTS AND ITS A RECIPE FOR DISASTER.  CURRENTLY 2 AVERAGE SIZED BOATS CAN FIT THROUGH BRIDGE AT THE SAME TIME.  IF A LARGER YACHT OR SPORT FISHER IS COMING THROUGH, ITS LIMITED TO ONE AT A TIME, FURTHER CONGESTING THE MARITIME TRAFFIC.

(6) Is a 15 minute hourly opening schedule sufficient for marine traffic? If not, please explain why.  ABSOLUTELY NOT.  A 15 MINUTE HOURLY OPENING WINDOW WILL LEAD TO SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN BOATING ACCIDENTS AND POTENTIAL CASUALTIES.  ON A NORMAL CURRENT OPERATING SCHEDULE DURING PEAK TIMES, IT IS NOT UNCOMMON FOR THERE TO BE APPROXIMATELY 30-50 BOATS WAITING ON EITHER SIDE OF THE BRIDGE.  ADD A MULTIPLIER OF 2X THAT IF THE 15 MIN. SCHEDULE IS NOT POSTED AND PEOPLE UNFORTUNATELY MIS-TIME AND THEY COULD BE WAITING FOR OVER AN HOUR AND HALF FOR THE NEXT OPENING. 

(7) Should the SR 707 (Dixie Hwy) Bridge opening schedule mirror the operating schedule of the FEC Railroad Bridge? NO",,,,,,,

Rumors of long train bridge waiting periods, congestion, and possible harm or threat to human life do to lack of access and speeding moving trains through an old train bridge and very congested and small train section through the heart of Stuart. 

A lot of people may be concerned about the old neglected train bridge but the over all effect this train system will have for downtown Stuart my be crippling. Boat traffic and road vehicle through this congested area before the addition to the passenger trains is already terrible. Now the expansion will make it worse. 

We can all see this issue is going to get worse. 

Thank you for your time. Please consider keeping Stuart the cozy well loved town it is now. Improvements are welcome. Congestion and risk are not. 

I see the train bridge schedule being a danger. To all surrounding boaters. Long wait line and congested boat traffic will cause additional hazards to boating travel through an already congested and dangerous water way. Please don’t allow the train schedule to create a potential harmful condition for boaters. 

Thank you. ",,,,,,,

Why would we allow a single Corporation to come into the area and put restrictions on a navigable waterway that have major impacts on the people and businesses that have supported this community for decades? Why would we put the special interests of this corporation above all else? I believe that before any new regulations or passed, the corporation should be forced to begin construction of the new railway and bridge which is the only real solution. This construction should have to be well underway, as a show of good faith, before they are allowed to operate on a new schedule. Construction should mainly be done during ""non peak"" hours as to minimize impact on the local waterways. As far as the regulated operating schedule, I think the following should be the minimum that the people and businesses of this area are forced to accept while the corporation completes construction of a new crossing:

- Drawbridge remains open for 45 minutes of every hour from 05:00 to 18:00 every day
- From 18:01 to 04:59 Drawbridge can be operated according the current proposal, Monday through Friday. Saturday and Sunday should be an even split of 30 minutes during this time.

Currently, it can take more than 15 minutes for the bridge to open up after a train passes. This causes massive congestion on the weekend and very unsafe conditions as you can have 100s of boats trying to maintain position on each side. Then when the bridge opens, boat traffic coming from both directions and a VERY narrow opening creates an extremely hazardous situation. This would be exacerbated if this bridge was closed for 45 minutes of every hour. We would be looking at a major increase in boating accidents in that area and add to the death toll that Brightline has accumulated in its short existence. With boat traffic on the weekends, this 15 minute window may not even be enough time to allow all of the boat traffic to clear that had accumulated during the last 45 minutes. People could be waiting for hours to get through this passage. Not to mention the economic impact of local real estate and businesses, who rely on relatively ""unimpeded"" access to both the Atlantic ocean and Gulf of Mexico through the OWW.",,,,,,,

Keep the bridge closed for 45 minutes an hour? Has anyone who made this proposal been at the railroad bridge when it's closed? This river is frequently used by many recreational and commercial vessels. The bridge area is a dangerous bottleneck with strong currents. When the railroad bridge is closed, it creates a serious traffic backup. It's not just a problem about trying to remain patient until the train shows up and passes completely over the bridge. It's also a problem of trying to maintain safe boating distances and controlling one's vessel in the strong currents around the bridge.

If the railroad bridge is only open for 15 minutes an hour, imagine the rush of boat traffic trying to ""make the bridge opening"" each hour. This is a recipe for disaster with potentially lethal consequences. 

We have to put up with a lot these days. But why are the governing powers asking boaters like myself, who live West of the Roosevelt Bridge, to give up their freedoms of reasonable access to our waterways? If the railroad bridge is kept down for 45 minutes an hour, my many neighbors and I will most likely be forced to reduce our outings to downtown Stuart, Manatee Pocket, and local restaurants and businesses. It's just not worth it. We don't want to fight to get through the bridge when so many other boaters, many with larger vessels, are trying to transit.

If a new bridge is not going to be built (as was promised to our community!), please do not close the railroad bridge for more than 20 minutes an hour tops. Longer closures will make it dangerous for us to use the waterway, and it will cause serious delays for anyone wanting to simply have a day on the water, or transit to or from the Okeechobee Waterway.",,,,,,,

That would be wholly unworkable. If you only allow one passage per hour a significant number of boats will stack up there and it will turn into a very unsafe madhouse, especially with a 15 minute limit. The RR bridge barely has enough room for one boat to pass. There is a limited amount of room between the RR bridge and the high bridge for boats to stage, many boats stage well east of the high bridge to avoid circling around in that tight space which leads to more time needed to clear the drawbridge. There is a good current running thru there, add a windy day and you WILL have incidents. What happens when a barge needs to come thru and some boater feels pressured to make the time limit? Simple, disaster.
Implementing a tight time limit of 15 minutes will not work. Boats need to stand off on either side far away from the RR bridge and will often be slow to get under way.
You are definitely creating a very bad situation.
I was under the assumption that this sort of limit would not be enacted until a new high span is constructed. A high span will hold up fewer boats that will require an opening.",,,,,,,

(2) How often do you transit this waterway? Multiple days in any given week, multiple times during those days. 

(3) If railway traffic impedes your navigation of this area, how long are you normally delayed?
Typically 15-20 minutes, however there has been occasions where the wait has exceeded 45 minutes. 

(4) How would you propose to regulate the balance of railway and maritime traffic in this area? A predictable opening schedule with special rules for weekends, holidays and other high marine traffic days. In addition, demand improvements to the rail bridge which include, at minimum, matching the average high tide clearance of the existing bridge. This should not be funded by taxpayer dollars.

(5) What challenges have you experienced when transiting this area due to these bridges and/or railway activity? High current, limited maneuverability due to marine traffic, boaters speeding up and operating their vessels un safely to “catch the bridge”.

(6) Is a 15 minute hourly opening schedule sufficient for marine traffic? If not, please explain why. No. This would create more marine traffic, unsafe conditions due to more boaters trying to “catch the bridge”, and can ultimately lead to a negative economic impact to the businesses and residents on the west side of the bridge due to frustration with the schedule.

(7) Should the SR 707 (Dixie Hwy) Bridge opening schedule mirror the operating schedule of the FEC Railroad Bridge? Only if there are improvements made to the railroad bridge which increase the height to match or exceed the Dixie bridge. Without improvements, the railway bridge at minimum must match the Dixie bridge openings, however the bridge should remain open, closing for a maximum of 10 minutes no more than twice per hour.

“ It's only a matter of time before there is a tragedy on the water due to this train bridge. As a boater it is not uncommon to wait upwards of an hour for the bridge to open. That means police or coast guard vessel that may be responding to an emergency are stuck. Additionally, once the train bridge opens, dozens of impatient and frustrated boaters are trying to get under the bridge at the same time. Just last week we waited for the bridge to open for over an hour, there was no train during that hour, the bridge was just in the down position. It is ridiculous that in this day and age there is no way for a boater to know the schedule for the bridge, you never know when it will be lowered and worse, you never know how long it will be down. It has gotten to the point that i need to plan a 30-60 minute wait into my commute back to our home. Boaters know that at times they'll need to wait on bridges, In my opinion, the bridge should be mandated to remain in the open position for at least 30 minutes out of every hour. The bridge is over 100 years old, the area west of the bridge is affluent and growing, it is unbelievable that no one is addressing the concerns of hundreds or thousands of boaters.

I have seen 25-30 boats on either side waiting for the bridge to open on the current schedule. If it is only open 15 minutes per hour it is inevitable that there will be more boats waiting to pass than is possible and will result in someone trying to ""beat the bridge "" before it closes and having the bridge close on their vessel. Then there is always the possibility of confrontation between operators over who gets priority to pass. Is it charter vessels who make their living on the water or is it recreational boaters who only have a limited number of days on the water?  Also of concern is the life expectancy of the bridge with an increase in traffic as well as the higher speeds which will cause more stress on the structural integrity of a bridge that is already past its expected lifetime. On another note, the wooden fenders on the bridge are in a state of serious disrepair from previous collisions now. The increase of congestion and everyone jockeying for position, there will be even more damage to the fenders and boats as people try to pass side by side through an area that at best can accommodate only 2 smaller vessels at one time.

(4) How would you propose to regulate the balance of railway and maritime traffic in this area? Find an alternate route west or build a more efficient bridge. 

(5) What challenges have you experienced when transiting this area due to these bridges and/or railway activity? I have had guest in my boat get thrown around due to waves/current, and having to wait to be able to move, instead of sitting waiting. 

(6) Is a 15 minute hourly opening schedule sufficient for marine traffic? If not, please explain why. No, we travel this area often and frequent, marine traffic should not have to wait for windows. Much higher risk for boaters than a train.

•A schedule such as this reduces the appeal of living upriver of this bridge, forcing potential homeowners interested in boating to look elsewhere. This will essentially devalue all properties upriver of the bridge and almost all of Palm City Florida.
•Massive boat traffic jams will occur, causing a hazard to navigation, accidents and potential injury.
•This schedule will also hurt local businesses such as marinas & restaurants upriver of the bridge, as it will reduce the number of boats interested in transiting the bridge to patronize their facilities. Ultimately, this will cause a loss of jobs in the area.

I don’t understand how this can be considered without rebuilding the span to a height that allows the majority of vessels to pass at any time.

As for the train situation, a set schedule and 30+ minutes per hour opened, should be the bare minimum we should accept! And the weekends should be 45 mins opened per hour.

But seems our local officials caved and we’re stuck with a 100 year old rusty relic as our “traffic light” on the water. Absolute shame!
This bridge serves as a MAJOR thoroughfare for not only the 10’s of thousands of people that live on the west side of the bridge, but it’s the ONLY route to Lake Okeechobee and the west coast of Florida, for people on the East side of the bridge. Also, many of us seek shelter from hurricanes by taking our boats west through the locks, which adds an entirely new level of boat traffic during those events.
A fair compromise can be reached for boaters, cars and trains. Please help be our voice to get this done so Palm Stuart and Jensen continue to be the beautiful and thriving “gems” we all moved here for!",,,,,,,

If I understand the proposed guidelines correctly, you are proposing to limit the boat access under the railroad bridge to ONLY 15 minutes per hour.  If you have ever been in that area during the weekend, it is already a very busy and sometimes dangerous area.  The current in that area in conjunction with the boat movement makes going through the railroad bridge tedious at best.  If you were to limit the time for boats to only fifteen minutes per hour, you are going to have a bottleneck of boat traffic and accidents are sure to happen.  I ask that you reconsider these restrictions to prevent unnecessary accidents in the area.  Boaters are already inpatient when waiting for the bridge.  If you were to limit that time, you will have even larger problems.  Spend the weekend in that area on any given beautiful weekend and you will see the restrictions are unrealistic.  I realize changes need to be made but it is an unrealistic goal with the amount of boat traffic that particular area experiences.  When the bridge stops traffic there for trains, boats back up very quickly and as soon as the bridge reopens all of the boats try to squeeze through that spot as quickly as possible.  If you were to restrict that time, you are certain to have more damaged boats, damage to the railway bridge and certainly a higher probability of human injuries.

There is no way, none, that this is going to work.  It is not only unfair, it’s unsafe.   Several years ago I was the captain of a Stuart based sport fishing charter boat.  We we’re docked west of the train bridge.  As such, I had a great deal of experience waiting in a long line of boats after the train went through.  As a captain, it was always a source of concern since waiting on the bridge wasn’t a good thing when you had paying customers onboard.  And that was years before this new train.  It was also a safety.  I’ve seen boats get into trouble in that area when packed into a small space while waiting.  Factor in the wind, strong tides, and less than experienced boaters and it becomes quite dangerous.   Again, this is already bad enough at times.  I urge you to find a much more equitable balance.

If Brightline is going to be utilizing the bridge to this extent, then they should be paying to raise the bridge to allow adequate boating traffic without the need for a designated timeline.

The current height of 6.6 feet at mean high tide is too low for most boats with any top of any design. The original request was for the bridge to be raised to 18 feet which would drastically reduce the majority of any delay of boat traffic.

Who exactly is going to take a train from Miami to Orlando? Neither one of these cities are like New York or Chicago with mass transit that can take you wherever you want to go so what happens when you get to your destination? Uber? rent a car? My guess is these trains will be running with about five or six people on them at a time. Millions of dollars are being spent on this and it's all going to waste. So now, along with all the traffic concerns from trains running through densely populated areas they want to completely destroy boating throughout the area. Opening the railroad bridge to boaters for only 15 minutes per hour is a recipe for disaster. This all could have been avoided if Brightline acquired the rights to run through the middle of the state. But like everything else, they didn't want to spend the money. My only question on this is who's pockets were line by this total sell out of the east coast of Florida??

(1) Do you currently transit through the FEC Railroad Bridge crossing the Okeechobee Waterway, mile 7.4, at Stuart, Florida?
Yes, we navigate these waters on a regular basis and are full time residents
(2) How often do you transit this waterway? At least two to three times per week
(3) If railway traffic impedes your navigation of this area, how long are you normally delayed? It ranges between 15 minutes and 30 minutes, on occasion we have been delayed much longer due to multiple trains
(4) How would you propose to regulate the balance of railway and maritime traffic in this area? I would proprose a regular schedule opening similar to the drawbridge opening. Open at least 30 mins every hour
(5) What challenges have you experienced when transiting this area due to these bridges and/or railway activity? We have been stranded on the other side of the bridge with no way to get home. Meanwhile our kids are left with no way home from school, also missed important scheduled appointments
(6) Is a 15 minute hourly opening schedule sufficient for marine traffic? If not, please explain why.
No I ideally a minimum of 20 mins, 30 mins would be best.  There are a large number of boaters who use the waterway. When the rail bridge opens you have a rush of boats trying to get through. Limiting this time would cause a danger to boaters and navigation due to limited time to pass and a narrow passage. This could cause boats to collide causing damage to boats and possible harm to passengers
(7) Should the SR 707 (Dixie Hwy) Bridge opening schedule mirror the operating schedule of the FEC Railroad Bridge?
Yes absolutely

I am a realtor in Martin County and my family owned American Custom Yachts for 40+ years. My sister use to live on the west side of the RR bridge and because of Briteline sold her million dollar home and bought in Rocky Point to avoid this disasterous schedule. All my family members are boaters.
My best solution is for Brightline to replace the RR bridge as previously promised. This would avoid high end home value decreases on the west side of the bridge as well as the boat traffic jams and dangers of such due to the present RR bridge opening schedule being presented. Thank you

First off, thank you to the Coast Guard for always keeping us safe!

As for the train situation, a set schedule and 30+ minutes per hour opened, should be the bare minimum we should accept! And the weekends should be 45 mins opened per hour. We were told Brightline would build a new high speed, modern bridge to help alleviate our (boaters) concerns! But seems our local officials caved and we’re stuck with a 100 year old rusty relic as our “traffic light” on the water. Absolute shame!
This bridge serves as a MAJOR thoroughfare for not only the 10’s of thousands of people that live on the west side of the bridge, but it’s the ONLY route to Lake Okeechobee and the west coast of Florida, for people on the East side of the bridge. Also, many of us seek shelter from hurricanes by taking our boats west through the locks, which adds an entirely new level of boat traffic during those events.
A fair compromise can be reached for boaters, cars and trains. Please help be our voice to get this done so Palm City, Stuart and Jensen continue to be the beautiful and thriving “gems” we all moved here for!",,,,,,,

In order to access any recreational opportunities I must pass through both bridges. 
I average 8-12 transits monthly, year round. 
The FEC bridge regularly restricts my ability to transit the Dixie Highway bridge due to its lack of coordination with the highway bridge. I have waited as long as 45 minutes or more on either side. Average wait is 20-30 minutes. 
Mariners and rail traffic should have equal hourly access. If one has precedence, it should be mariners as we pay high tax bills to support the road/bridge system in Florida. The high speed rail system is a luxury many taxpayers will never use. 
When the railroad bridge is down, no one can transit due to the low clearance. Small and large, power and sail along with commercial traffic are forced to compete for space to wait. The normal tidal flow is always rapid, always creating dangerous situations. Add wind and it is worse. 
A 15 minute hourly opening is not sufficient to accommodate marine traffic. Miss an opening and struggle for 45 minutes is not acceptable. 
The highway and railroad bridges must match   ",,,,,,,

I use this passage at least once per week. At times, almost daily. Being West of the RR bridge, it is critical that the bridge be open for traffic. I have been stopped at the bridge for over 2.5 hours when multiple trains were moving through. When traffic is backed up on weekends, 15 minutes is not enough time to clear the backup in both directions. Extended openings on weekends would be needed. Hundreds of boats pass through this bridge daily. If openings are not assured, not only will boating suffer but property values will be severely impacted as well. I have a home on the water. This would ruin the value of my home and destroy the boating lifestyle as well as kill businesses associated with boating. Regular openings must be incorporated into any schedule or ruin will be next. A major problem is the time it takes the old RR bridge to close and open. The closing takes 5 minutes!. You are going to have people racing through a narrow waterway trying to beat the closing. This, in turn, is going to end up causing a major accident. The current in the area can run 5-6 knots! You back up 20-30 boats through this narrow choke point and disaster will happen. The bridge should remain open until trains come, just as it has been in the past.",,,,,,,

As it stands now the bridge goes down when a train comes and lifts back up when it’s done-I can’t see any reason for this to change.
I understand trains and I understand the needs of transit but boating is that as well and it is also a sense of our lifestyle here as well as our economy for many. 
Keep it equitable if a boat is coming the bridge goes up if a train is coming the bridge goes down simple as that.

2. I traverse it a few times a month

3. 5-10 min

4. Well first, don’t Enact this idea as proposed. Widen the opening and make the bridge higher so more boats can get under it closed. Or use the tracks out west would be the main proposal 

5. The amount of boats going through under current conditions makes it a slightly dangerous run as it is. It’s busy most days when the bridge opens and traffic flows and that’s with limited closings. The bridge opening is very narrow making it hard to move large amounts of boats through the area in the short window you propose to have it open to traffic

6. No. It’s absurd and obviously proposed by those who could not care less about our county, boaters, etc. and must be in the pockets of this silly train. This proposal cuts off the flow of traffic in a very heavy maritime area. It also chokes the flow of boat traffic to the Okeechobee Waterway and locks, which will hurt our town even more financially. Anyone who has watched the flow of boats can see the narrow low opening when the bridge is down results in a backlog of boats who won’t all be able to cross in 15 min. For the comfort of a minimal fee train riders you will restrict thousands of boaters, fishermen, rugs, and marine traffic. Then with the Old Roosevelt openings to time, most boaters will never be able to get through in a short time. This will result in financial impact to boaters who must hold position waiting 45 min for openings and then who will scramble to get through risking the safety of others passing through.

We live on the South Fork of the St Lucie, upstream of the bridge, and pass through the bridge frequently.  With just the current FEC cargo rail traffic, we have been held up multiple times for 45 minutes or more, with boats stacking up on either side of the bridge. The bridge closes several minutes ahead of the train's passage, and generally the trains, which are quite long, take several minutes to cross, moving at a very slow pace.   Often the bridge takes several minutes to open after the train's passage.  Adding the Brightline to that existing schedule will cause excessive boat traffic and unsafe operating condtions due to the congestion, tight channel width under the FEC bridge, and frequent high tidal currents at the bridge locations.   

Even if 15 minutes per hour were possible, I believe that it is not nearly enough to satisfy the requirements for safe vessel traffic through the area.  Additionally, I believe that this hindrance to navigation at this location will substantially affect home values in the areas upstream this bridge.   As a minimum, the bridge should be open to vessel traffic for the same amount of time that it is closed for rail traffic. ",,,,,,,

•This bridge serves as a MAJOR thoroughfare for the only route to Lake Okeechobee and the west coast of Florida, for people on the East side of the bridge. Also, many of people seek shelter from hurricanes by taking boats west through the locks, which adds an entirely new level of boat traffic during those events.",,,,,,,

My fondest memories have been fishing in the various rivers and ocean from Palm City. I plan on continuing to live in this area and spend as much time fishing and traveling on the waterways as possible. I speak on behalf of the hundreds of boats that go through the bridges every day in saying that whenever the train bridge is down it is a serious hindrance to our time, money, safety, and boating experience. We understand that trains must pass, but boats also must pass and there is extreme local interest in keeping the waterways that give Palm City, Port St Lucie, Stuart, Jensen Beach open to access to downtown stuart, manatee pocket and the ocean. I will not accept having the waterways blocked for the majority of the day and will seriously reconsider where I chose to live based on how accessible the ocean is.

On top of accessibility, safety is at the forefront of my mind. I was part of an emergency situation near the bridges where I saw a law enforcement boat that could not pass underneath the train bridge. The thought of the bridge staying down for extended amounts of time during the day greatly worries me and demonstrates a misunderstanding that the 'powers that be' have for how dangerous this can be to the community. Having the train bridge down for extended parts of the day makes me worried about safety and the inability of emergency workers such as tow boats, law enforcement boats, fire boats, and coast guard to reach areas of the water that see much boat traffic. It is as if there were a gate at the entrance of your neighborhood: it would prevent people from going out to work (as many of my friends do charter fishing), it would prevent people from going out to support local businesses (fuel, bait, restaurants, etc), and would prevent emergency workers from getting in. A lack of infrastructure like this at the entrance of my neighborhood would be unacceptable and is equally unacceptable on the water in my mind. 

There is no doubt that changes can be made to accommodate the boating and fishing community in our area to continue giving them the access they need to our waterways. ",,,,,,,

1 hr
(4) How would you propose to regulate the balance of railway and maritime traffic in this area?
Open the road bridge as soon as the railroad bridge opens
(5) What challenges have you experienced when transiting this area due to these bridges and/or railway activity?
This is a very difficult area to navigate due to the three bridges, currents, winds, angles of structures limiting visual fields. 
(6) Is a 15 minute hourly opening schedule sufficient for marine traffic? If not, please explain why.
No, restricting boat traffic to this time frame will lead to massive congestion
(7) Should the SR 707 (Dixie Hwy) Bridge opening schedule mirror the operating schedule of the FEC Railroad Bridge? At minimum yes, however keeping the railroad bridge closed for long periods of time is not appropriate either.

I have witnessed Boat US unable to render assistance to a vessel in need due to the lag time of the RR bridge. If this schedule passes, the Coast Guard, Sheriffs Dept, and FWC better prepare to spend many hours monitoring the behaviors of boaters crossing under the RR bridge.
The safety factor is another huge issue. With numerous vessel’s occupying the many marinas and anchored in the moorings, a fire or medical emergency will see a huge lack in response time as there is no alternate route.

This would be an extremely dangerous idea as the access through the narrow channel  at the railroad trestle already produces heavy wakes along with the ever changing currents. 

This coupled with the extremely old, ill maintained trestle which breaks down more often than not would be catastrophic to the boating community which we all paid for dearly.

I transit this waterway and this bridge 4-6 times a month recreational and occasionally as a Merchant Mariner. I have personally waited over 2 hrs while 3 trains past over the bridge during 1 closing.  It has happened a number of times. The bridge stays down for 20-30 minutes before the next train arrives. 
I feel that the best way to handle this is to have a bridge tender for the train bridge. Only allow one train to pass per bridge closure and only allow the bridge to close within 5 minutes of a passing train. 
I think 15 minutes per hour opening is a dangerous plan. The amount of boats that pile up within an hour could be easily 40-50 boats on a weekend or holiday. To expect that many boats to transit through the bridge 1 at a time is not practical. Cross currents at the bridge create a difficult situation for novice mariners or large boats. 
I think it would be reasonable for the SR 707 bridge to open on the same schedule as the FEC bridge.
Ultimately raising the bridge to atleast the height of the 707 bridge would alleviate a large part of the problem.

3) typically when a train comes I’m delayed anywhere from 15-30 minutes

The boat traffic shall have more use. If the railway uses the crossing more on certain days the it shall take precedence. 
5) there are times when the closure of this railway has put me and my family in danger. When trying to get home before a storm, we have been caught by this rail bridge with severe winds and lightning. 
6) I couldn’t imagine why this crossing would need to be shut 45 minutes of every hour if that’s what 15 minute hourly opening means. This is unreasonable. Even during week days I’m sure more boats cross this rail way than trains. 
7) I do not traverse this crossing, but I’m sure it has the same or more traffic then the Stuart crossing 

In summary on the weekends when this railway closes I have seen 40+ boats waiting on Both sides waiting for this crossing to open up. When it does it creates a very dangerous situation with many boats some very large trying to go through a very small passage. I highly recommend on the weeks this railway closes no more that was it currently does now and trains should be limited to after hour travel. There are thousands or residents west of this rail crossing in stuart. The north and south forks are very large river systems with multiple boat ramps. The residents of this area use this river way more that the railway and should not be cut off because the railway did not plan out their services.

No, 15 minutes is not enough time to allow both East and West bound vessels to clear the narrow opening between both bridges.

To get to the sandbar or fishing areas, I must transit under the Stuart bridge(s). On a slow/during the week day, the bridge arrangement works okay: typically there is moderate boat traffic and waiting for RR traffic may take 5-7 minutes if the RR bridge is even down. Since MOST boats do NOT fit under the RR bridge (90+%), but can fit under the Dixie bridge, most of us wait on both sides of the RR bridge during this time. When the RR bridge is raised, we queue up to move and there are rarely issues.    
Weekends & holidays are another matter.  There is just an incredible number of boaters transiting in both directions throughout the day - the open bridge waterways can barely support the constant stream of traffic. When the RR bridge goes down, people race to beat the bridge. The boaters who get 'caught' hang out on ALL sides of the RR & Dixie bridges. There are no queues so when the RR bridge goes up, boaters move quickly to get through the alley, sometimes creating large wake and cutting off other boaters. This is exacerbated when large boats need the Dixie bridge raised in tandem. Since the increase in boat traffic over the past 2 years has intensified this existing problem, implementing a 15 minute hourly opening schedule for marine traffic is insane & shortsighted - and will only increase the danger to boaters and their safety. Ideally, the current RR bridge down time works fine; however, given Brightline's forecasted increased capacity, recommend the up/down time be 50/50 with 30 minutes on the hour for each conveyence. Monitoring should be implemented and recorded, timeline schedules should be published online/through local marinas/broadcast on Marine radio -  and there should be a manned contact point for mariners to reach Brightline. If the 'local' contact is in Jacksonville, how is that individual going to maintain visual of the RR bridge if something catastrophic should occur? 
The Dixie Bridge opening schedule may not need to mirror the operating schedule of the RR Bridge; however, an assessment of CURRENT boating traffic needs to be done to determine an equitable time for the large boats that pass under both bridges.  
In closing, Brightline absolutely must build a higher bridge as outlined (& promised) to Stuart.  This is the only workable solution to what promises to be boat congestion and boater safety issues.",,,,,,,

Additionally, the proposal seems to go against the main reason we all live in Florida and why thousands of people are moving in monthly.  We all want to enjoy the water and a year long outdoor lifestyle.  

When the railroad bridge goes down, boats are already typically delayed around 25 minutes.  All boats who have found themselves on the east of the bridge know this already creates a dangerous bottleneck of boats getting moved around by tides pushing them into other boats, toward bridge supports and into the shallow areas on the north side of the river.  Implementing a 45 minute period of time for boats to stack up every hour seems even more dangerous.  Also, I question if boat traffic could even clear in 15 minutes as boats try to one by one in each direction try navigate a narrow span. By the way, there are quite a few larger boats and inexperienced baiters who commonly “take up” most of the  space in the narrow channel.  This will add to the danger of the situation as boaters try to rush through the span or end up attempting to stop and not collide with oncoming boats navigating through the center.

In my opinion, the solution lies in the height of the railway span.  Unlike the Dixie highway span, it provides around only 6 feet of navigable clearance.  This obviously keeps 99 percent of all boats from being able to get under the bridge while in the down position.  Anyone who has traversed that section knows it to be a visibly decaying and outdated structure presently.   The solution is to raise and upgrade the railway bridge to the same height as the Dixie highway bridge at a minimum.  Shouldn’t businesses be required to invest in their infrastructure.  If their business model makes sense, those investments should be more than covered by the revenues form riders.

Simply put, implementing a 15 minute window for boat traffic would be a decision we all know will lead to even more unsafe conditions in this area while taking away from the quality and quaintness of the open waters in Stuart, FL.",,,,,,,

Comment:
You have got yourselves a real dilemma here. The RR bridge, aside from financial considerations, clearly needs to be replaced, as was the Niantic River (CT) Railroad bridge. If motorists were required to transit this bridge, its condition would long since have been addressed. That said, my statistically uninformed feeling is that 15 minutes of opening time per hour, particularly during ""the Season"" is nowhere near adequate, and that numerous collisions and other adverse incidents can be expected with boaters rushing to get through. Many, if not most of the boats transiting this route can clear the highway bridge when closed, but not the RR bridge. Adding these craft to the mix of waiting vessels near the entrance to the nearby marina and between and near bridge trestles will lead to further adverse incidents.

Obviously, the ""simplest"" solution is a 50-50 share of transit time between rail and marine traffic. This won't work, either. How can rail traffic possibly be coordinated to this schedule? Even with, say, two 15 minute openings per hour, the folks who operate their boats like they operate their cars will help create serious adverse conditions - rushing to get in and hurrying to get out through a one way ""street"". 

As an engineer, I will now lose sleep on either end of the night trying to figure this out. But, not to worry - I know you folks, or some one you know will find an elegant solution to this. Maybe marine seat belts?

As it is now, when the train bridge is down and boat traffic backs up, it can become a dangerous situation to try to get through the bridge. Between small boats in a hurry, large boats trying to navigate the narrow opening, sometimes very strong currents, and more and more inexperience boaters, this is a recipe for disaster.  Our entire area is built around boating and fishing. It is unbelievable to me that anyone would think 15 minutes in an hour is enough for boat traffic to pass through. The back ups this would cause especially during season would be dangerous. The effect this would have on residential property values as well as any boating and fishing related businesses located west of the bridge  is not taking our best interests into consideration.

We cross under the railroad bridge at least twice per day. We have had to wait for over an hour on several different occasion and a 30-40 minute wait is very common. I find it unacceptable. 

The bridge is lowered way in advance of any trains coming, causing lots of boat traffic delays. If the bridge was lowered just a few minutes before a train passed and then raised immediately after, it would be much more efficient. The train bridge should only be lowered for one train to pass, not 45 minutes to an hour for multiple trains to pass. On the occasions we have been stuck for an hour, multiple trains have passed over the bridge. There should be a one train limit and the bridge should only be lowered once per hour. 

The coast of Florida was settled and thrives because of the water, both oceans and rivers. Stuart and the surrounding areas are no different and depend on boat access at all times. Boat access should not be impeded by the train bridge. The waterway was here first and is much more important to the local economy than train traffic that passes through. If the trains want access all the time, they should build a new track west of town without a bridge. Further restricting boat traffic under the bridge will negatively affect property values and the marine industry around Stuart that rely on using the river.

Yes, I transit this area often. As does any boater coming from the west to visit any area east of the bridge. This area is a high traffic area for boaters in the Stuart area. 

(2) How often do you transit this waterway? I transit this waterway on a weekly basis. Usually 2-4 times per week. 

(3) If railway traffic impedes your navigation of this area, how long are you normally delayed? Right now it usually takes 20-30 minutes from when the bridge comes down. 

(4) How would you propose to regulate the balance of railway and maritime traffic in this area? The best answer would be to replace this aging bridge. Bright line should be required to make improvements or all together replace the current bridge with a high speed bridge or one that is higher that doesn’t need to be opened as often. With the amount of times the train will be coming through, the current bridge is too outdated to be used for this type of train travel. If the bridge cannot be improved or replaced, then the opening needs to be made so that boats can travel at least 30 minutes each hour. Ideally a 45 minute window each hour for boaters would be best. This would give the train 15 minutes each hour to pass through. 

(5) What challenges have you experienced when transiting this area due to these bridges and/or railway activity? This area sees strong tidal currents and high traffic with a very narrow passage way. The bridge often can only fit 1 boat through at a time, especially with many large vessels traveling through here.  Closing the bridge more often will cause worse traffic patterns with a high number of boats all trying to get through a narrow passage from both directions, which in turn will lead to accidents, injuries, and property damage. 

(6) Is a 15 minute hourly opening schedule sufficient for marine traffic? If not, please explain why. A 15 minute opening is way too short of an opening for boaters. A 15 minute opening will cause people to try to rush through an already tough area to navigate. The additional stacked boat traffic will cause extreme amounts of boats trying to “make it through” the bridge, and cause very unsafe boating conditions. Additionally, there is limited space on both sides of the bridge for boats to hold while waiting for the bridge. Safety should be a priority here, closing the bridge more often will without a doubt make this area less safe. 

(7) Should the SR 707 (Dixie Hwy) Bridge opening schedule mirror the operating schedule of the FEC Railroad Bridge? The Dixie highway bridge doesn’t need to be opened as often as the train bridge. Many boats don’t need the Dixie highway bridge open to navigate through, but the train bridge is much lower. ",,,,,,,

With the existing schedule you can observe large congregations of boats waiting on the bridge. There is a strong current in the area which makes it difficult for some vessels to hold position, and this gets worse as congestion limits manouvering. 

15 minute may not allow for sufficient time for an orderly and safe passage of all vessels waiting. And will create an unreasonable vehicular backup on the road. 

I do think the vehicular bascule bridge schedule should match the railroads. I've personally invested 1 vessel incident, where a sailboats mast was broken due to the railroad bridge closing while the vehicle bridge was open and calling for the vessel to pass. I am aware of several similar incidents. As these incidents occur on recreational vessels, without licenced mariners, and inexperienced operators it's likely that these incidents are never reported to the USCG and the USCG has no knowledge.",,,,,,,

Florida used to be a paradise 50- 60 years ago as I was growing up and before that. I actually love trains, but what Brightline is proposing is going to ruin my beautiful state. While the idea of a train connecting South Florida to Orlando seems to be a great idea, again it will ruin the beauty and the relaxing lifestyle of the Florida  I once knew. 32 Trains a day is absolutely ridiculous. Many people have already been killed by these trains. Being a reasonable person, if the train must happen, I believe that 4-6 trains per day would be more than sufficient. 2-3 trains  northbound and 2-3 trains southbound. This is very reasonable, and allows the trains to run as opposed to not having them at all. If there were to be only 4-6 trains per day, then it would not adversely affect the railroad bridge and boater traffic. We have been boaters our whole lives , so in addition to affecting our daily lives, as we live east of the railroad tracks, this would also affect our boating and we truly do oppose this. In order to preserve Florida as it has always been, we need to STOP trying to make it like New York! If people cannot come here and enjoy the beauty and unhurried lifestyle, then they should not come here at all! It appears this train is catering to Disney, and Disney has RUINED central Florida!

Unfortunately, the tressel was down for 1.5 hours.  The third train did not arrive for 45 minutes after the second.  Plenty of time to let boaters pass.  When the FEC was called they stated it was because they were behind schedule and needed to get the train through.  The result was 20 boats waiting to pass.  This created an unsafe boating condition.  Not to mention, building seas as wind increased.  

What would this schedule do in a hurricane?  Many boaters move their boats through the locks during a hurricane.  It is already a busy hectic time.  This will only add to the mayhem.

The request by Brightline to prioritize openings to meet their increased schedule is a real possibility.   We have 232 homeowners that moved to Palm Cove because of our Marina and access to the waterways.  Our property value will vastly be decreased by allowing Brightline to control the narrative.  The Bridge is too old to handle all of the increased openings and closings.  Boat traffic will be allowed a sliver of time in each hour.

I found this excerpt pretty quickly in the Regs. Please not C, & E.1.  This proposal does not give ""due regard to the necessities of free and unobstructed navigation"" for marine traffic and will cause unreasonable danger in the area to both small and large vessels.

§ 116.01 General.

(a) All bridges are obstructions to navigation and are tolerated only as long as they serve the needs of land transportation while allowing for the reasonable needs of navigation. 

(b) This part describes the general procedures by which the U.S. Coast Guard determines a bridge to be an unreasonable obstruction to navigation and issues an Order to Alter under the authority of the following statutes, as appropriate: Section 18 of the Rivers and Harbors Appropriations Act of 1899, 33 U.S.C. 502; Section 4 of the Bridge Act of 1906, 33 U.S.C. 494; or the Truman-Hobbs Act of 1940, as amended, 33 U.S.C. 511-524. 

(c) A bridge constructed across a navigable water of the United States shall not unreasonably obstruct the free navigation of the water over which it was constructed, either due to insufficient height or width of the navigation span, or because of difficulty in passing through the draw opening. If any bridge unreasonably obstructs navigation, the Commandant, U.S. Coast Guard, will order the alteration of that bridge. Alterations may include structural changes, replacement, or removal of the bridge. 

(d) Whenever the Coast Guard has good reason to believe that a bridge across any of the navigable waters of the United States is an unreasonable obstruction to navigation, the Coast Guard will give notice to the owner of the bridge and other interested parties, and hold a public meeting at which the interested parties will have a full opportunity to be heard and to provide information on the question of whether alterations to the bridge are necessary and, if so, the extent of alterations needed. 

(e) If the Coast Guard determines that alterations to a bridge are necessary, the Commandant, U.S. Coast Guard, will issue to the bridge owner an Order to Alter containing details of the alterations necessary to render navigation through or under the bridge reasonably free, easy, and unobstructed. 

(1) In the case of a railroad or publicly owned highway bridge, an Order to Alter is issued to the bridge owner under the provisions of the Truman-Hobbs Act (33 U.S.C. 511 et seq.). In ordering these alterations, the Coast Guard will give due regard to the necessities of free and unobstructed navigation and of rail and highway traffic. For alterations to bridges governed by the Truman-Hobbs Act, the Coast Guard must approve general plans, specifications, and contracts for the alteration project, as well as approving the apportionment of the total cost of the alterations between the United States and the bridge owner. 

(2) For all other bridges, the Order to Alter will contain the required alterations for the bridge and will prescribe a reasonable time in which to accomplish the required alterations. The bridge owner is responsible for the entire cost of the required alterations.

We are avid boaters and cross under the 2 draw bridges every other weekend as our ramp is just up the North Fork river. The challenges are that when the bridges are in the down position for any length of time the boats waiting to pass under pile up and become a hazard to one another. The currents that run under the bridges can move pretty swift. The road traffic bridge opens when needed on the half hour. The clearance is quite good and I would say that about 60% of the boat traffic can move through with no bridge opening required. However the other 40% have to time their movements through the narrow bridges on the half hour. It seems to work pretty well until the train bridge comes down. Once that happens it can take a lot longer and I would calculate 90% of boaters have to wait due to the very low clearance (6ft). In my opinion, if the train bridge was kept in the down position any longer than it is today there will be a lot of angry boaters. The amount of boat traffic that passes through there in a day is remarkable. I would seriously consider the affect this will have on the local tax paying boaters as well as the transient boaters that bring their money here to spend in our counties. The train will service the area and I understand the importance of this but big business should not impeade the rights and lifestyle we have come to enjoy here on the treasure coast. Special attention should be paid to the weekend schedule of boaters as this would be the biggest disruption. ",,,,,,,

Yes

(2) How often do you transit this waterway?

1-2 times a week

(3) If railway traffic impedes your navigation of this area, how long are you normally delayed?

My vessel is moored at Safe Harbor Harborage Yacht club so I do not transit the bridge when headed east towards the inlet to go offshore.  However, on a weekly basis I like to transit to the west side of the bridge for sunset cruises. Most of the time, I am only delayed 5-10 minutes as I transit at times the bridge is open on demand. The longest I have been delayed is 45 minutes and that was waiting on the train bridge.

I have also been delayed over 30 minutes because I was waiting for the opening time only to have the train bridge close and interrupt the scheduled opening.

(4) How would you propose to regulate the balance of railway and maritime traffic in this area?

I think the current opening schedule works fairly well. I can plan my departure to coincide with a scheduled opening if I need to. Occasionally, that gets interrupted by a freight train but those closings are not excessively long and the bridge opens.

To have a single 15 minute per hour opening is utterly ridiculous. I’m sure that proposal came from brightline to a paid off government bureaucrat who doesn’t care how much their decision messes stuff up. The boat traffic could be such that not all those waiting could get through safely because of how narrow the train bridge passage is; it only allows a single vessel to pass through.

The scheduled train should operate their schedule to accommodate a train bride schedule. The train operators get to enjoy an automatic close on demand schedule because the freight trains don’t place as much of a burden as the empty passenger trains will. They cannot just dictate and get what they want!

The boaters have to accommodate to scheduled openings. The trains need to do the same thing and operate to accommodate that both bridges will be open at the same time to allow boat traffic to transit.

(5) What challenges have you experienced when transiting this area due to these bridges and/or railway activity?

The biggest challenge is when I get to the bridge at a scheduled opening time and the opening is delayed because train bridge closes.

(6) Is a 15 minute hourly opening schedule sufficient for marine traffic? If not, please explain why.

Absolutely not! Especially on weekends and holidays. It seems the boat traffic would be too much to allow all the boats to pass in 15 minutes for two reasons. The train bridge blocks all boat traffic. Smaller boats can transit the vehicle bridge but not if the train bridge is down. This would cause significant backup of boat traffic. The other reason is the train bridge only allows a single vessel to pass through at a time. 15 minutes an hour is not enough!

(7) Should the SR 707 (Dixie Hwy) Bridge opening schedule mirror the operating schedule of the FEC Railroad Bridge?

Hell no! I think we need to keep in mind that the boats don’t need the bridge. The vehicles and trains need the bridge! The bridges block the navigable waterway and that needs to mean something. I agree with having a schedule for opening times for the vehicle bridge, but I also think the train need to accommodate a scheduled open time for the train bridge as well. Especially for the passenger trains that operate without any passengers!",,,,,,,

This is due to the extremely narrow clearance of the FEC Bridge.  If there are vessels transiting East and Westbound 15 minutes will not be adequate for the marine traffic to clear the area.  East and West bound cannot transit the FEC Bridge at the same time.  Also the holding area for the Bridge (to the East) is beyond the 65' fixed Bridge which, if West bound, increases the time required to transit the FEC Bridge further restricting marine traffic at an admitted choke point.  I use this particular waterway several times monthly from December through May.  It would be convenient if the SR707 Bridge could mirror the FEC Bridge schedule.

First, is the age of the railroad crossing bridge. Any boater That has passed through the Crossing cannot help but note the age and the disrepair of the bridge opening.

Second is the opening width itself.  There is barely enough room for boats to pass, the currents in that area can run very fast. The combination of the width of the opening and the currents makes passing through the bridge opening treacherous.

Third, is the frequency with which the bridge opens and the time between its closing and the passing of a train.  It is not unusual for the bridge to close 15 minutes before a train passes. On occasion the bridge will stay closed for multiple train crossings, resulting in the bridge remaining close for up to 45 minutes or more. During this time up to 50 to 100 boats accumulate on either side of the closed railroad bridge.  When the bridge does finally open, there is a nautical version of a traffic jam passing in both directions through the narrow opening of the railroad bridge.

Fourth, is the now proposed Brightline train utilization of the same railroad bridge. Given the current state of affairs with regard to the closing of the bridge and the accumulation of recreational vessels, the addition of more trains passing can only make this a more dangerous and congested maritime passage.",,,,,,,

Brightline is an amazing resource.

If boats come expecting to pass and they can't then you are going to have major issues at the high traffic times of the day. ",,,,,,,

This will have a negative impact to the safety of all boaters passing through as the width of the opening only allows for single file movement with limited staging on the West and East approaches.  In addition to being a safety issue, this opening proposal will untimely impact  all commercial and recitational boat owners as well as marinas and restaurants on the West side.  Many of the homes in Palm City have water access and with the proposed new schedule, home values are surely going to drop.  At a minimum, boaters should have the same window of time as Brightline.

I am 100% against this train to begin and now you trying to shut the waterway down to 15 minutes per hr passage is WRONG. Maybe the train should only be  able to cross  for 15 minutes per hr.

I would like to comment on the proposed schedule for bridge openings/closings for the Brighline trains passing over the St Lucie River. I was initially told that Brightline was going to elevate the bridge to a height that would accommodate most boats, however this does not appear to be happening. I would also suggest that bridge closings be less than 50% of the time. This bridge already is closed for an unreasonable amount of time, especially at night when it can be closed for hours at a time. Adding another 32 closures a day will be chaotic, and extremely unfair to boaters if not managed properly. 

Thank you,

Yes
(2) How often do you transit this waterway?
4-5 times per week
(3) If railway traffic impedes your navigation of this area, how long are you normally delayed?
When the bridge is down we generally have to wait 10-30 minutes, one or two times longer.
(4) How would you propose to regulate the balance of railway and maritime traffic in this area?
Build a higher bridge, or put an extension that goes further inland and diverts train traffic away from the area.
(5) What challenges have you experienced when transiting this area due to these bridges and/or railway activity?
With the increase in boating ownership (boats like houses are oversold), and the increase in new boaters, this area has become less predictable as most new boater's have no clue who has right of way.  The marine traffic has increased significantly since the study done in 2018 by the ACOE.
(6) Is a 15 minute hourly opening schedule sufficient for marine traffic? If not, please explain why.
No, it takes 15 minutes on most days to clear marine traffic, longer on holidays and weekends.  And that is with three openings on weekends per hour.  The bridge opens on the hour and 20's, and is still busy.  The rush to make it through an opening will be very unsafe to the boating public, and many children are on these boats as there are many boat ramps on the west side of the bridge that allow land locked people to launch their boats and go to the sandbar and beach.  Also, those boats on the East side of the bridge need free access to run West when a hurricane approaches.  The canal provides safe harbor access for hundreds of large vessel who run up here from as far south as the keys.
(7) Should the SR 707 (Dixie Hwy) Bridge opening schedule mirror the operating schedule of the FEC Railroad Bridge?  The Railroad Bridge should at a minimum mirror the Dixie Hwy Bridge.  The RR Bridge should be up whenever possible so that boats with 12ft or less clearance still have free use of the channel.",,,,,,,

After-all the reasoning for the new bridge was two-fold; one,  the existing bridge mechanics would not hold up to 34 additional daily openings, and two, boaters would be severely impacted by up to 5 openings per hour during  peak hours for combined freight and Brightline trains unless the bridge was elevated above 15 feet. 

It’s apparent that the reason that the rail operator wants this 15 minute window is solely to significantly reduce the number of openings because they fear that the the very old bridge mechanics will fail and affectively shut down the rail line indefinitely - essentially taking FEC and Brightline to $0 revenue until resolved. Thus, there is literally zero concern for the boaters and more about covering up that the restoration is likely a fundamental failure due to the age of the steel and gears and that it was never designed to open thus frequently.

The solution is that Brightline must build a new bridge and find the funding for it. Or, Desantis should suggest that the Disney extension and Tampa extension are on hold until thus is resolved. Or, can finding from the Infrastructure Act be made available? ",,,,,,,

Often the bridge closes 15 minutes before a train starts to cross then another 5 to 15 minutes to cross then another 5 minutes to open all told it might be impassable for up to 25 minutes as things are. If there were only two trains per hour that would leave only 10 minutes of open time. The area to go through the bridge id very narrow allowing only one boat of size to fit and having a 20 minute wait causes many boats to back up on either side - upon reopening there is a mad scramble to get through as you never know when the next train is going to come ( they REFUSE TO PUBLISH ANY SCHEDULES). IT IS JUST A MATTER OF TIME UNTIL A SERIOUS BOA ACCIDENT RESULTS FROM THIS POOR PLANNED USE OF THIS RAIL LINE.

FURTHER - when the local authorities approved this Brightline thing it was said that the train company was going to raise this very old bridge. Suddenly after the line starts operating they renew on the ""Promise"" to raise the bridge because it costs to much!!! The result is a This water sensitive boating community is very adversely affected by a commercial interest that brings not a penny of value to any of the communities it is impacting  that depend on this waterway - the net effect will decrease property values up river and lead to dangerous conditions for the local population. I do not see any local tax relief from this train and only negative selfish and greedy corporate interests.",,,,,,,

- It is unfair to prioritize the train over the boaters. Brightline has not proven economic benefit that would justify this favoritism. Equal time should be the minimal case.
•15 minutes is not enough time to clear the area of waiting boats. Massive boat traffic jams will occur, causing a hazard to navigation, accidents and potential injury. The cost of fuel for idling boats should be considered as a factor
•This schedule is likely to hurt local businesses such as marinas & restaurants upriver of the bridge. Transiting the bridge to patronize restaurants and the city of Stuart will be damaged. This has a greater economic impact then the benefits of Brightline. 
••Closing this bridge for 45 minutes every hour will reduce the appeal of the Okeechobee Waterway at Stuart, Fl by causing unreasonable delays. It is a heavily transited area that will greatly impact many boaters.
•The proposed schedule puts a negative value on living upriver of this bridge, causing potential home buyers to favor areas not affected by the limited boating schedule for the bridge. This will cause devaluation of all properties upriver of the bridge in Port St Lucie, and almost all of Palm City Florida.",,,,,,,

I am answering the questions posed, so that the US Coast Guard will understand better how this will impact all boaters using the St. Lucie River.
Here are my answers to your questions.
III. Information Requested
To aid us in further developing a proposed rule, we seek responses from waterway users to the following questions:
(1)	Do you currently transit through the FEC Railroad Bridge crossing the Okeechobee Waterway, mile 7.4, at Stuart, Florida?
Yes, we transit through the FEC Railroad Bridge crossing the Okeechobee.  We are recreational boaters and love to fish.  Our vessel is short enough that we do not need the Dixie Highway bridge to open for us to pass.
(2)	How often do you transit this waterway?
We transit this waterway at least four times a week.  Twice a week to the East and twice a week to the West.  
(3)	If railway traffic impedes your navigation of this area, how long are you normally delayed?
We have been lucky to not be impeded by the RR bridge often.  However, there was a time at 7 am one morning, that we had to wait at least 30 minutes, as two different trains were using this bridge.  By the time the bridge opened, there were 15 boats on the West side and at least 15 boats on the East side, all trying to get through the narrow passage.  It was dangerous to have that many boats in such a small area, especially with the current running as fast as it was that day.
(4)	How would you propose to regulate the balance of railway and maritime traffic in this area?
Since Brightline was supposed to have built a new bridge, maritime traffic should have the majority of the time with the bridge open.  I would propose that the RR bridge get on the same schedule as the Dixie Highway bridge and using a Bridge tender.  The RR bridge should be opened all the time, unless a train is coming.  The trains should be scheduled to cross bridge between 15 after the hour and 15 before the hour.  This would allow the RR bridge to be down at the same time as the Dixie Highway Bridge, but only if a train is going to cross.  A bridge tender is definitely needed to make these changes work.
(5)	What challenges have you experienced when transiting this area due to these bridges and/or railway activity?
Since we transit the area between 6 and 7 am going West and between 1 and 3 pm going East most days, we have not had many challenges in this area.  
(6)	Is a 15 minute hourly opening schedule sufficient for marine traffic? If not, please explain why.
It is not sufficient time for marine traffic.  During our one time where we waited for 30 minutes for the bridge to open, there was already chaos amongst the boats that were stuck on both sides of the bridges.  The opening is narrow and many times, only one boat can transit the opening at a time.  Since this is also a no wake/slow zone, it makes travel time longer as well.  Slow boating around the bridges is necessary, I understand that.  But with slow boating; numerous boats; narrow passage way and the current, this will make for a very dangerous area for all boaters.
(7)	Should the SR 707 (Dixie Hwy) Bridge opening schedule mirror the operating schedule of the FEC Railroad Bridge?
No.  I understand having to stop the traffic on the hour and ½ hour to let some of the bigger boats get through the area.  Traffic does not stop and is not timed.  However, trains can be timed.  The trains should only travel across the current bridge when the Dixie Highway Bridge is down.  Other than that, the RR Bridge should remain open like it currently is.
Not building a new, higher bridge is a shame.  It will be interesting to see how long this very, very, very old RR bridge will actually stand up to lots of trains, going at very high speeds.
What is going to happen when the bridge won’t open any more?  What is going to happen when the first train jumps the tracks and shuts down the waterway?
It is not a matter of if, just a matter of when.

Marine traffic should maintain Its historic preference over the increased traffic that a new passenger rail system super imposed onto a freight line has created.  This bridge was built in 1937 and is not safe as it is.  The passenger rail service should at the very least be required to rebuild the bridge to current safety standards and match the closed bridge clearance of the Roosevelt bridge.  I have personally had to wait more than 50 minutes for trains to clear and the draw bridge to reopen.  The USCG needs to consider that this bridge schedule is not just for higher speed passenger rail but also for long and slow freight trains.  Safety and marine traffic must be considered highest priority!

 Thank you to the US Coast Guard for your service. 
As for the train scheduling issue, Brightline originally told the community it would build a modern bridge to help alleviate our local concerns. 
However, that did not happen and now we’re stuck with a 100 year old rusty relic instead. 
This bridge serves as the thoroughfare and it’s the only route to Lake Okeechobee and the west coast of Florida, for people on the east side of the bridge. 
Also, during hurricanes boats are moved west through the locks, which adds an increased of boat traffic. 
A fair compromise must be reached for all parties involved. ",,,,,,,

Prior to the the Repairs of the Roosevelt Bridge conducted last year the Old Roosevelt bridge / Dixie Hwy bridge would open on call via channel 9 or via phone for boaters, this was changed to operating every 30 minutes during repairs and has never been changed back to opening on call?  This action alone shows exactly what will happen if further restriction on passage is considered.  It has created log jams for Boaters of vessels of all sizes cuing for the bridge opening.  Currently the train bridge closing are part of the daily life and are unexpected and annoying.  But if further restrictions is put upon the Train bridge openings that will only worsen the problem, creating an unsafe situation.  As it stands now most smaller vessels only have to cue when the train bridge is down while larger vessels have to cue for the Old Roosevelt 30 minute openings.  Changing the Train bridge access will put too many boats in a very small area, making it unsafe for Mariners.  Additionally many smaller boats can escape the weather by having open passage, if the Train bridge access is restricted this will add to the congestion during poor weather and visibility.  Until a new bridge can be built, boaters should have at least the same access to pass through as the trains will have to pass by.  We are boat owners, pass under the Train bridge 4-6 times a week and are normally delayed about 20 minutes per week waiting for cargo trains to pass.  If changes are to be made Boaters should have the same access as trains to pass by a 15 minute hourly access will not only create a safety issue, but impact the value of all property owners who depend on passage. Putting the train bridge and Old Dixy highway bridge on the same schedule would not allow for smaller boats to pass to avoid congestion.  It would just put faster smaller boats rushing around larger slower craft all to make an opening at the same time making a small channel of access very dangerous.  And it is already dangerous, especially on the weekends.",,,,,,,

To access the sandbars, key waterways and ocean I must transit under the open  FEC Railroad Bridge - my boat fits under a closed Dixie Hwy Bridge.  I must go through here every time I take my boat out.  When the railroad bridge is down currently, I'm usually delayed around 10 minutes.  However, in that time many boats gather and need to hold position while awaiting the bridge to reopen.  It is currently challenging to navigate in these waters with strong currents and winds with multiple boats in the area.  I am extremely concerned about the proposal to limit bridge openings to 15 minutes out of every hour.  The log jam of boats would be EXTREMEMLY dangerous not only near the bridge, but approaching the bridge from areas such as Bessie Creek.  I need to back my boat out of my slip near the mouth of Bessie Creek.  If all of the boat owners further down the creek are trying to catch the 15 minute window, it will be crowded in the creek and not allow me to even get my boat out!  I do not even believe that 45 minutes worth of boats that would be cued up could safely make it under the bridges in 15 minutes.  This will cause people to rush and add to the danger to person and property.  
I believe it is totally unacceptable prioritize Brightline over the rights of those that have lived and boated in this community for years.  If anything, the proposal should be the opposite - Brightline should send their trains through in a dedicated 15 minute window, not the boaters!  Allowing Brightline to take over our bridge and cut off our citizens from the waterways, impacting their safety, enjoyment of the area, and property values is not acceptable.  
Brightline is a private company that will make a lot of money from passing over our bridge, yet the local citizens get nothing in return.  They should build their own bridge with acceptable clearance for the majority of boats before extending their line.  If that truly can't be enforced, then they should pay a huge fee every time they cross so that we can build it for them, and they should limit the open time of the bridge to just a few minutes before the train comes through.  They may claim this is less safe for them than having their proposed 45 minute window, but no one has considered the boaters safety - who have just as much right if not more to access that area!
Please straighten this out before it ruins Palm City and Stuart.  I'm afraid it truly has the potential to do that.",,,,,,,

In the current environment, before Brightline, I recently waited for 45 minutes to get through the bridges and this was on a weekday. The train bridge goes down and we waited for almost thirty minutes and a short train finally came through, but the bridge takes some time before it goes back up. The passage through the train bridge area is so narrow, only one boat  can pass and it is a scary passage given the currents. Boaters are left to negotiate with each other as the bridge tender does not get involved in the navigation of boats through the bridges. On a weekend with heavy traffic, it can take a while to clear the boat traffic once the two bridges are open. I am afraid that anything less than the potential to have thirty minutes per hour of possibility to make the bridge passage by boat will be insufficient. This is not to say that thirty minutes per hour is needed all the time, or maybe not even most of the time as I am sure that night time and weekdays are not as active on the water. But this railroad crossing is a dangerous situation today and if boat traffic gets stacked up due to constraints from trains, then this will be a real nightmare of a problem for boaters. I believe the train bridge needs to open/close quicker before and after trains pass so that the amount of time for boats to pass through is reasonable. It would also make this area safer if the train bridge is widened to allow for two way passage during the times when the bridge is open. Again, this is one of the scariest places to pass through, and I believe it is already dangerous and can only get more dangerous with the suggested additional train constraints with no improvements to infrastucture. Widen the bridge and speed up the open and close timeframe as a compromise. Boaters and trains are both important.",,,,,,,

I live in the North River Shores area West of the mile 7.4 bascule bridge in Stuart. My home is on the water and I am an extensive boater traversing that bridge at least twice a day, three to four times a week. My vessel is a small center console of 29 feet in length and need a 10 ft clearance at mean high water to traverse that bridge. This, of course means that I must wait when the bridge is closed for train traffic which is usually about a 10-12 minute wait mid week days. But on weekends, holidays, and especially on Holiday weekends the boating traffic can stack up on either side of the bridge 10 boats deep. Considering how narrow the passage is under the train bridge, it is a dangerous exercise for boats traveling in opposite directions to traverse under that bridge in a hurry. The CG proposal of a 15 minute opening every hour would cause such a stack of waiting boaters that no one would be able to cross safely and I believe many would get trapped waiting for hours to get under that bridge.
 I believe a better solution for the CG would be to remove the single leaf bascule bridge at mile 7.4 and replace it with an identical double leaf bascule bridge  as the one at mile 7.5 with a 14 ft clearance at mean high water. This would allow most local boating traffic under both bridges while they were in the closed position, leaving only the large private Yachts and Charters to traverse the area at a predictable time. That being said, there is another reason the CG proposal of leaving the single leaf bascule bridge in place with a 15 minute opening every hour is problematic For those who live on the west side of that bridge it would seriously impact home values. People buy homes on the water so they can enjoy the waterways, not watching trains block the use of those waterways. But if the CG allows the trains to have priority over boating the values of those homes west of the bridge will be measurably decreased. 

Thank you for your consideration.

I do transit this opening 3-4 times a week(both ways). Currently the amount of rail traffic presents delays that are acceptable,depending on the time of day, usually about 10 to 15 minute delays..  I would propose that since the rail operations have a very specific time table, they should adjust their timing to the current opening schedule, not the other way around. This area is a bottleneck and vessel traffic accumilates quickly. On the East side is especially tricky due to minimal space for vessels to wait and at times extremely strong currents. the span is not large enough to allow for opposing vessels to pass through at the same time, so it is one at a time and can be time consuming
A 15 minute per hour opening would have accumalated so many vessels,on a busy day you would never clear all the waiting vessels who would have to wait another 45 minutes to the next opening. Another aspect is the vehicular traffic waiting for 15 minutes? You do understand this road empties directly into the heart of downtown Stuart, which on a good day is already packed with traffic
As far as coordinating with the two bridge openings, but I do not know the FEC proposed changes to its schedule

If a barge goes through it will take a considerable amount of time, no other boat traffic would be able to get through the bridge during that opening.  
We go through the bridge 2-3 times per week. 
The bridge needs to be renovated and raised another 8-10 feet so most boat traffic can get through without an opening, otherwise, it needs to be open to boat traffic longer than 20 minutes/hour.

The vast majority of the traffic consists of recreational boaters of limited experience.  The chances of an accident increase with the duration of the closing of the bridge.
6) 15 minutes per hour open is not sufficient.  45 minutes open, or closure only for the minutes before, the duration of and the minutes after a train traversing the bridge would be a safer schedule.

With a new rail bridge 16 feet above the water and a 90 foot opening, (this is what we are being told is possible and in the planning stage) allowing 92% of the vessels under when closed this would make closings less crowded, safer and much more tolerable. 
It blows my mind why a new bridge has not already begun construction, the FEC and Brightline are waiting for public grant money....
I say BS to that!
These are two very large companies that profit off these rails, they do not let me ship or ride for free why should we fund this. They need to go and float a loan like the rest of us if they cant right a check.
There should be no additional train traffic that will add any additional closures until this rust bucket of an antique bridge is replaced with the one being planned for.
Brightline and the FEC need to slowdown their other endeavors and focus on this new bridge.
How can they be allowed to add more trains, with this type of infrastructure??

Opening every 15 minutes is not enough unless the bridge was rebuilt taller to allow boats with t-tops to safely travel under it. Closing at specific times maybe the top of the hour is a much safer option or maybe Brightline should have to pay to increase the height of the bridge and the width? This would also affect the value of homes on the west side of the bridge limiting the access to the ocean. I also believe with the amount of boat traffic , not all of the boats would even be able to travel thru there in both directions within that time period. This would definitely cause concern. Remember you are responsible for the safety of boaters and the waterways, if this happens  every accident that happens while traveling thru there with the heavy traffic or while waiting  for the bridge will be on you.

(2) How often do you transit this waterway? Several times per week

(3) If railway traffic impedes your navigation of this area, how long are you normally delayed? I have been delayed most times minimum 1/2 hour and up to and over an hour. 

(4) How would you propose to regulate the balance of railway and maritime traffic in this area? The most practical way would be to raise the bridges or re-route passenger train traffic. Alternatively is there a way to speed up the pace in which the bridge does operate? 

(5) What challenges have you experienced when transiting this area due to these bridges and/or railway activity? Mostly challenges with navigation, there is heavy current and heavy recreational traffic most weekends that makes navigating or “holding” a position challenging especially with inexperienced novice boaters surrounding you. 

(6) Is a 15 minute hourly opening schedule sufficient for marine traffic? If not, please explain why. Absolutely not! In most cases it takes longer than that for most traffic to clear in a “On demand” scenario. Now we want to build up a holding traffic pattern in both directions and expect the transit to go smoothly in 15 minutes?? People will be rushing and cutting each other off to not miss the opening!

I don’t think that is fair to the residents of our community, both boaters and non boaters as both will be affected by this decision.   If this is the case our city council should change their mind about allowing Brightline to travel through our community.  The issues facing our boaters include not only massive wait times to cross but decreases boater safety with the challenge of moving all those boats through in such a short period of time.  You can’t even equate the number of times the drawbridge opens a day now as the majority of boats can fit under it.  However those boats cannot fit under the railroad bridge so all boat traffic will stop.  One will not be able to move boats safely through the railroad bridge opening in both directions in a mere 15 minutes.  Boaters also use this waterway as a hurricane evacuation route to move their boats inland in a hurricane.  By backing up the boat traffic at a time when time is of the essence you will be putting both life and property at risk. In order to attempt to clear boat traffic in 15 minutes, the bascule bridge will need to remain up for the entire time halting traffic in the area for more than 15 minutes per hour.  This will back traffic up into downtown Stuart affecting the ability of people to get in and out of downtown (and could perhaps affect the ability of emergency vehicles to get to their destinations).  It will also back up traffic on the north side of the river, with a great probability it will back up onto US1 causing disruption to a major thoroughfare...again with possibility of hampering emergency vehicles.

Brightline is not even going to serve Stuart and Martin County, yet Stuart, is going to be the most negatively affected city on Brightline’s route. Brightline has thumbed their collective noses at our little community, having alluded to or promised both a terminal and an elevated railroad trestle to not negatively affect our waterways and followed through with neither. Brightline reneged on both. 

I live off the North St Lucie River, and go through the trestle almost every time I go out. To think that I now have to plan for a tiny little 15 min window on each end of my boating excursions, is ridiculous. The trestle being down has already been borderline dangerous on weekends with boats trying to stay in position with the current and bumping into each other. I’ve seen as many 50 boats corralled up at the bridge when the trestle was down for 2-trains back to back for example. I can’t even imagine how bad it’s going to be. 

What I will speculate, is that the trestle isn’t going to open on time, every time, there will be delays, double trains etc and/or all the boats waiting to get through won’t be able to with one bridge cycle and will be stuck until the following hour. I have also raced home, outrunning dangerous storms and the idea of being stuck at the bridge for 45 mins in the middle of a dangerous storm, is unacceptable! 

I also believe this schedule will negatively impact many businesses, who will no longer get the same amount of business from boaters, who will stop patronizing these businesses by boat because the logistics of planning a trip through the bridge will be too much of a hassle.

Negatively impacting the safety of any and all boaters that use this route should be the biggest stopping point for this decision. We have been operating like this for a very long time and to only close and open the bridge more often does not put safety first. Imagine how much more maintenance this will cause the bridge to need. More maintenance adds more cost, more shutdowns and it increases the chance of someone getting hurt while working fast to re-open the bridge. To add, the lack of parts due to ""covid"" will increase the shutdown time while waiting for parts which also causes ""work arounds"" which means more safety issues. 
Solution:
1-Keep the schedule as is. 2-Build an alternate route for brightline trains. 3-Gather all comments and come up with something better than what is beings considered because this does not work for us many boaters that use this route to visit restaurants, go fishing, transfers during approaching hurricanes and for taking our families out for joy rides.

That meeting was designed to field questions from boaters about Brightline (its predecessors) and boating access under the bridge. When my question could not be answered, a  representative calculated the estimated time that the bridge might be closed each hour. The answer became 45 minutes of every hour. That is unacceptable.

The answer to this problem is to elevate the bridge to where 90% of boat traffic can pass at high tide. I have been a boater that passes the railroad drawbridge for the last 18 years. At this time there are very few boats that can safely pass under the bridge when it is closed. Any comment to the contrary is not accurate.

The structure of the bridge is narrow. The boat traffic especially on the weekends is quite heavy. If the bridge is open only 15 minutes per hour as estimated, this location will become one of the most dangerous in our state. I am so concerned that we will have property/boat damage and injuries or deaths if a change to the bridge height is not required.

The existing railway traffic frequently causes delays and a build up of boat traffic.  It is not uncommon to leave the dock early for a day of fishing only to encounter that railway bridge is down. This can easily result in a 30-40 minute delay. Periodically, the delays are longer if another train is coming in the opposite direction as they leave the bridge down.  Any small boat with a T-top and up is blocked by the FEC railway bridge.

Furthermore, the RR bridge is very old and slow.  I have seen a published plan to replace this RR bridge with a vertical elevator type.  The plan showed a much more significant height clearance in the down position which would help immensely.  

Another issue with this RR bridge and challenge when considering additional railway traffic is the fact that the width of the waterway at the RR is narrow.  If boat traffic were limited to only a 15 minute window per hour for passageway, it would be highly dangerous let alone destructive to the residents’ way of life.  We are a waterfront/boating community.   The danger would result from boat traffic backing up in both directions with a narrow opening as well as significant currents.   The narrow passageway of the FEC railway bridge frequently requires some boaters to wait while a larger vessel with greater beam navigates through here.   On weekends and holidays, you would require law enforcement to direct and control traffic.   It would be a nightmare. 

I do not recommend correlating the A1A draw bridge with the FEC RR bridge.  The A1A draw bridge allows most single level boats with a T-Top to pash under safely in the down position.  Only vessels with towers and higher profiles require an opening of the draw bridge which they run efficiently.  

I suggest that Brightline fund a new FEC RR bridge that has the same, or greater than, clearance of the A1A draw bridge so a significant percentage of users can transit this area safely.  The residents of Martin and St. Lucie Counties deserve safe and equitable access to the waterways un-encumbered by special interest groups.

It takes five minutes or so to open or close the span, not 45 minutes.   Little coordination by the train operating staff would be needed to lower the span on demand, and no delay on the part of the train since it needs to slow anyway.  Fifteen minutes of boat transit time per hour is marginal considering some commercial boat traffic takes nearly fifteen minutes to negotiate the passage.  In addition the freight trains that share the same bridge don’t run on an iron clad schedule and delaying them due to a sheduled span opening is a non-starter.  I transit the passage under the railroad bridge or cross the Old Roosevelt bridge by car daily, and have done so for the last 20 years.  By making the opening and closing times on a schedule you inconvenience users of both bridges. ",,,,,,,

In 2020, there was a plan ($100M) to replace the bridge with a lift bridge  that included double-track, a much higher clearance when closed, and a much wider span.  Studies for years have suggested that maritime traffic will be impeded by the frequent closures of this bridge.  Now they are suggesting limiting traffic past this obstruction to 25% of the time?   The three bridges within a very short distance and currents and wind make this area a challenge to mariners, but constant traffic jams and boaters trying to “beat the bridge” will result in accidents.  The Coast Guard needs to ensure that the railroad’s “right of way” doesn’t create a menace to maritime safety on this waterway.  The railroad should build the new bridge as planned or be forced to limit their operations.  The railroad “right of way” should not be taking precedent to a maritime “right of way” because they are now reneging on their commitment to solve the problem they are causing.  They should be required to build the new bridge that would permit the majority of vessels to pass when the bridge is closed, and then have openings for taller vessels every 30 minutes (+/-).

Kelly and I met you at a Tom Kean event in Highland Beach.  We are boaters and live on the west side of the Loxahatchee railroad bridge.We now have a new lift railroad bridge with an additional second set of tracks. There was no attempt to widen the span nor elevate it.  Its a somewhat dangerous bottleneck when boats attempt to pass through the intermittent bridge openings. Boats get stacked up waiting for passage as much as 20 minutes before a train actually passes.
The RR road crossings also cause major traffic buildups and now the route #1 bridge in Jupiter is scheduled to be torn down and replaced more traffic will congest the RR crossings especially onto route 811 (Alternate A1A).  This railway seems to be more about commercial/industrial transport than passenger service. The rail lines should be moved westward and parallel the interstate 95 and Florida turnpike in a commercial industrial corridor away from and not thru one on the most highly developed beautiful coastal residential areas of southern Florida. I would urge you to suspend high speed trains on this line and limit commercial traffic to night time service only and please stop the horns at midnight!

We purchased our waterfront home in order to have unrestricted ocean access.  Having the railroad bridge down for 45 min every hour is unacceptable.  This will lead to waterway rage and huge backups of boats in the channel, as well as accidents or even deaths.  We have already had to anchor before when the bridge was down, with 20 other boats waiting, and that was later in the evening!  15 mins is also not enough time to allow the enormous amount of boat traffic to pass, especially with large and small boats trying to fight their way through.  If boats missed getting through, then they would remain anchored or in idle, blocking the channel, disrupting the fuel dock area and entrance into Sunset Bay Marina, and creating a chaotic mess of traffic.  Are marine police going to be available to monitor this mess?  How will 30-40 boats line up single file to get under the bridge every hour?  We can't even control traffic and accidents on our South Florida highways!

I live and keel my boat west of the railroad bridge. I traverse the area at least several times per week and have been held up over an hour on several occasions. The fact that there is no set schedule is ridiculous.
A set, published schedule of closures would be very helpful maybe alternating every 15 minutes as needed for closures.
An ideal solution would be to raise and modernize the existing bridge so most vessels would not be impacted by closures.
Hurricane threats are a whole other problem as this is the main route used to move vessels away from the coastal areas!!!",,,,,,,

(4) How would you propose to regulate the balance of railway and maritime traffic in this area?  MARITIME TRAFFICE SHOULD BE GIVEN PRIORITY THIS IS A FEDERAL WATERWAY...BRIGHTLINE SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO BUILD THE BRIDGE ORIGINALLY PROPOSED THAT WAS SUPPOSE TO HAVE A CLEARANCE SPAN OF 18 FEET....I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHICH POLITICIANS LET THEM GET AWAY WITH THIS...AT A MINIMUM...THE TRAIN BRIDGE CLEARANCE SHOULD BE THE SAME AS THE HIGHWAY...14FEET AT CENTER...IF YOU CAN MAKE IT UNDER THE HIGHWAY THEN YOU CAN MAKE IT UNDER THE TRAIN BRIDGE

(5) What challenges have you experienced when transiting this area due to these bridges and/or railway activity?  WINDS AND CURRENTS CAN MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO MAINTAIN STATION IN THE AREA WHEN THERE ARE A LARGE NUMBER OF VESSELS WAITING TO GET THROUGH THE BRIDGE...BOATERS ARE ALSO NOT WELL VERSED ON WHO HAS RIGHT OF WAY CAUSING VESSELS TO TRY TO PASS IN BOTH DIRECTIONS AT THE SAME TIME THROUGH THIS NARROW OPENING.

At the time of it's completion in 1925, Martin County, Florida had fewer than 5,000 residents. Traffic to the river above the bridge site was far lower than it is today, with most of that traffic including smaller vessels and river barges that did not necessitate the raising of the bridge span. 

It has been clear for decades that the Florida East Coast Railway has taken a 'make do' attitude to its infrastructure in Martin County, including this bridge. It has been able to do so, in large part, due to its operation of increasingly limited freight rail service that interferes with river traffic only a handful of times each day. The use of this rail line for passenger service, or any significant increase service for that matter, presents a significant conflict to river traffic. The significant usage restrictions imposed by the proposed schedule is unacceptable. It is unacceptable due to the fact that FEC had announced several plans previously to replace this span with a structure which would not interfere with river traffic to such an extent. It is unacceptable because the new passenger service FEC plans to profit from necessitates such improvements in infrastructure. It is particularly unacceptable due to the fact that, should such a regulation be approved, it is an imposition of cost by FEC from itself onto the taxpayers and residents of Martin County, Florida. 

Rather than pay to replace aging infrastructure, this company is asking the United States Coast Guard to limit the free movement of people on a public waterway, so that its new passenger service may be more profitable. Toss out this regulation. The United States Coast Guard should instead be informing FEC that increased utilization of its rail line will necessitate a new bridge structure over the St. Lucie River.

If not synchronized then that makes for tricky maneuvering between the two Bridges where often there is high wind and current. It is challenging when you are the only vessel. This would cause staging of multiple vessels adding to that challenge and the likelihood of collision. Moreover, timing the bridges eastbound if have Dixie Highway is on demand and the rail his scheduled would be difficult since it is an unknown how long it takes to get through the Dixie Bridge.

As it stands now, when the bridge does go down, dozens of boats are stuck on both sides for approx 45 minutes.  When it goes back up, the boat traffic trying to all get through at the same time is extremely dangerous.  The space under the open rail bridge is very narrow already and only allows for one boat to travel through it at a time. So boats are competing to pass from both directions (one at a time) and it causes a very dangerous situation when you take into account the number of boats trying to get through, the narrow passage, the currents and wind.   If you limit the amount of time to 15 minute openings an hour, you will greatly increase the danger to traverse that area that already exists, by dramatically increasing the boats that will be stuck on both sides and racing to make it through the narrow channel before the bridge goes down again.  The only true solution would be to raise the height of the bridge to the height of the Dixie Highway bridge, to allow the current normal size vessels to be able to traverse underneath both when they are in the down position.  

There will be serious dangerous consequences to life and property if this train bridge only stays open for 15 minutes at a time.   

I live in the west side of this train bridge and my boat is kept on a canal behind my home.  Trailering the boat to a boat ramp east of the tracks is not a viable solution for me or the thousands upon thousands of other homes that are west of the bridge.  This waterway also connects the east coast to lake Okeechobee and the Gulf of Mexico.   You will be greatly impacting commerce and boat traffic that need to make the crossing, further adding to the dangers of potentially hundreds of boats stuck on both sides trying to pass though this narrow channel in a short window of time.  I traverse under this bridge on my boat several times a week.  I have personally witnessed boats trying to traverse under the open bridge at the same time when it gets busy and have seen boats strike each other, as well as striking the wooden pillings under the tracks.  I have also seen boaters attempt to get under the rail bridge when closed and strike the bottom of the bridge.  

15 MINUTES OF OPENING AN HOUR WILL CREATE A VERY DANGEROUS SITUATION TO THE LIFE AND SAFETY OF BOATERS.  ",,,,,,,

I view this as a huge takeaway for the marine business and boat owners located west of the RR bridge. This proposal will create a dangerous atmosphere as numerous boaters who gather waiting for their chance to transit this narrow channel.  The limited width of this channel under the RR Bridge creates additional challenges given the currents, winds, and boaters varying skill levels. It’s my opinion that simultaneous two way traffic through this channel will not be safe.  Make it one way traffic enhances boater safety but restricts boaters time even more.  I’m generally in favor of supporting mass transportation but not at the detriment of good judgement and safety.

Suggestions;

	1. Raise height of the railroad bridge to give transit to boats to the height of the adjacent bridge for Dixi Highway.  12” ?
	2. Widen the RR bridge channel or add a second lift to the existing bridge for safe two way traffic.
	3. Reduce rail use to 30 minutes per hour or less.
	4. Scrap the rail idea and find and electric bus to transport passengers from West Palm to Orlando via the Florida Turnpike.

Alternatives:
	1. Compensate business and homeowners west of the bridge for lost business and lower home values.
	2. Bare some liability for accidents in the waterway in the waters under and in the vicinity of the RR bridge.
	3. Station a traffic person bridge with the authority to control boat traffic.
	4. Don’t care and proceed as planned.  Please publish the names of our politicians who were supportive of this debacle

The Okeechobee Waterway is a major east/west traffic and with the restrictions of lock openings you would be stranding boats not able to make it to the coast on an east bound trip or eliminate the ability to traverse the whole waterway on a west bound trip.

There are many major marinas and hundreds of homes with docks that would be affected daily with this closure, the number of boaters affected runs into the thousands possibly each day.

Tides and currents strongly affect this area and this could possibly cause many boating accidents as a back up in either direction is affected by bridges and marina traffic.  This would be a nightmare!

Remember, Brightline chose this route over an inland route that would be free of coastal bridges.  They knew and took into consideration the possibilities of delays and scheduling issues..

To aid us in further developing a proposed rule, we seek responses from waterway users to the following questions:

(1) Do you currently transit through the FEC Railroad Bridge crossing the Okeechobee Waterway, mile 7.4, at Stuart, Florida?  

      Yes
      
(2) How often do you transit this waterway? - 

     4 - 6x per week.

(3) If railway traffic impedes your navigation of this area, how long are you normally delayed?

     I find that if you are sitting there when the bridge comes down, it takes a minimum of 15 min. I have sat there for 45 min multiple times.

(4) How would you propose to regulate the balance of railway and maritime traffic in this area?

      The railway bridge needs to be replaced/elevated to accommodate the majority of boats with T-tops (non tower). Around 9 feet clearance.

(5) What challenges have you experienced when transiting this area due to these bridges and/or railway activity?

      This railway is so low that it is unpassable if you have a T-top. You have no choice but to wait. 

(6) Is a 15 minute hourly opening schedule sufficient for marine traffic? If not, please explain why.

     Absolutely not. Just to navigate the three bridges that are right next to each other in that area takes 5-7 min at idle speed. With the amount of boat traffic 
     that area sees. I have seen boats increase to dangerous speeds when the train bridge signal goes off to avoid having to wait. If there were only 15 minutes 
     per hour allowed, I believe it would be a safety hazard and we would see an increase in altercations and accidents.
     15 min would not be enough to allow all the boats that would be waiting to get through. 

(7) Should the SR 707 (Dixie Hwy) Bridge opening schedule mirror the operating schedule of the FEC Railroad Bridge?""""

      If raising the railway bridge is not feasible, the Railroad bridge needs to mirror the SR 707 schedule. The ""Saturdays, Sundays, and federal holidays from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. the draw need open only on the hour, 20 minutes after the hour, and 40 minutes after the hour"" - would be a much better schedule than the 15 minutes per hour being proposed. Not only would this allow more traffic through, as is obvious, but both being in sync would also alleviate the congestion from larger vessels.",,,,,,,

Here are my answers.

(1) Do you currently transit through the FEC Railroad Bridge crossing the Okeechobee Waterway, mile 7.4, at Stuart, Florida?

Yes - quite often.

(2) How often do you transit this waterway?

Two to four times a week

(3) If railway traffic impedes your navigation of this area, how long are you normally delayed?

Sometimes as long as 30 minutes 

(4) How would you propose to regulate the balance of railway and maritime traffic in this area?

Could you set the drawbridge to open on a specific schedule - say on the half hour and the hour?

(5) What challenges have you experienced when transiting this area due to these bridges and/or railway activity?

Because there is no scheduled time that the bridge opens, you just have to get lucky.  If we knew when it would open it would be much easier to manage.

(6) Is a 15 minute hourly opening schedule sufficient for marine traffic? If not, please explain why.

No it's not enough.  I think you should try for two 10 minute openings.

(7) Should the SR 707 (Dixie Hwy) Bridge opening schedule mirror the operating schedule of the FEC Railroad Bridge?

I understand the need for the trains to run but the railroad should be able to adjust their schedules.

They made promises to get what they wanted and once all those agreements were in place and being implemented they changed their mind? I don’t think that is fair to the residents of our community, both boaters and non boaters as both will be affected by this decision. If this is the case our city council should change their mind about allowing Brightline to travel through our community. The issues facing our boaters include not only massive wait times to cross but decreases boater safety with the challenge of moving all those boats through in such a short period of time. You can’t even equate the number of times the drawbridge opens a day now as the majority of boats can fit under it. However those boats cannot fit under the railroad bridge so all boat traffic will stop. One will not be able to move boats safely through the railroad bridge opening in both directions in a mere 15 minutes. Boaters also use this waterway as a hurricane evacuation route to move their boats inland in a hurricane. By backing up the boat traffic at a time when time is of the essence you will be putting both life and property at risk. In order to attempt to clear boat traffic in 15 minutes, the bascule bridge will need to remain up for the entire time halting traffic in the area for more than 15 minutes per hour. This will back traffic up into downtown Stuart affecting the ability of people to get in and out of downtown (and could perhaps affect the ability of emergency vehicles to get to their destinations). It will also back up traffic on the north side of the river, with a great probability it will back up onto US1 causing disruption to a major thoroughfare...again with the possibility of hampering emergency vehicles. The fine people of community agreed to Brightline’s proposals because we were assured that it would not have a negative impact on our boating communities. People will be hurt. ",,,,,,,

I currently transit the RR bridge waterway 6 times weekly and have to spend a large amount of time waiting on the bridge in its current state. It is particularly problematic in the mornings when the RR is running freight and will keep the bridge down for extended times between trains.  I call the RR company for information and repeatedly are told they are running late but they will not bring the bridge up. I have waited for over an hour and half before being able to pass through in the early morning. The weekends exacerbate a dangerous bottleneck due to the volume of boats trying to pass. The solution is not a new schedule that will heavily favor trains. The answer is replacing the 100 year old bridge with no clearance underneath. Even more important than that, the RR should parallel i-95 and not run 80 mph trains 28 times a day through heavily populated downtown communities. This will absolutely kill many more people than it already has and I am appalled that this plan is moving forward. To open only 15 minutes hourly must be a joke. It takes a large boat 4-5 minutes to position appropriately and pass through the bridges safely. There will be a large number of boats waiting on each side trying to pass through this small and dangerous window. ",,,,,,,

Currently over 80% of the boat traffic fits under the old Roosevelt drawbridge and does not require an opening.  Currently for larger boats it takes close to 15 minutes (on a non-busy, non-weekend) just to arrive, wait for an opening, wait for surrounding boats to proceed, and then pass through safely.  Now imagine 5x times the traffic trying to cram through during that 15 minute window.  You must also take into account the human factor of aggressiveness boat operators will undertake when they know if they don't squeeze in before the train comes they will have to wait another 45 minutes.

Yes

(2) How often do you transit this waterway? Weekly 

(3) If railway traffic impedes your navigation of this area, how long are you normally delayed? Does not delay me at this time.

(4) How would you propose to regulate the balance of railway and maritime traffic in this area? I would keep it the way it is currently by lowering the rail bridge when necessary for a train to pass through. Should the railway truly need the bridge to be down more often during the week for rail traffic, I do feel a fair compromise (only if done during the week) is to have a schedule for opening on the 15 & 45 of the hour in sync with the Dixie Hwy Bridge on demand as there is generally a lot less recreational marine traffic during the week. That being said, having the rail bridge left open Saturday & Sunday when not in use and the Dixie Hwy bridge to be on demand as it is now, should work for most of the recreational boaters in our area. 

(5) What challenges have you experienced when transiting this area due to these bridges and/or railway activity? Currently, with the strong current and tight passageway it can get a little crowded. That being said it is easily navigable with the rail bridge up and Dixie Hwy bridge on demand.  

(6) Is a 15 minute hourly opening schedule sufficient for marine traffic? If not, please explain why. No, the rail bridge is to short for most recreational boats to pass through, the Dixie Hwy bridge is sufficient for most boats to pass underneath when lowered. When larger vessels have to wait to pass through the Dixie Hwy bridge, it creates a traffic jamb as it is, only having a 15 min window to pass through both the rail bridge & Dixie Hwy bridge will be a disaster with the amount of marine traffic in the area.   

(7) Should the SR 707 (Dixie Hwy) Bridge opening schedule mirror the operating schedule of the FEC Railroad Bridge? No, the rail bridge should remain up when not in use and the Dixie Hwy bridge should open on demand as it is now.",,,,,,,

YES.

(2) How often do you transit this waterway? 2-4 TIMES PER WEEK.

(3) If railway traffic impedes your navigation of this area, how long are you normally delayed? 30-45 MINUTES PER TRANSIT.

(4) How would you propose to regulate the balance of railway and maritime traffic in this area? FIRST, IF BRIGHTLINE INSISTS ON USING THIS ROUTE, THE 97-YEAR OLD BRIDGE NEEDS TO BE REPLACED WITH A 20' MINIMUM VERTICLE CLEARANCE, DOUBLE SPAN. THEN IT NEEDS TO OPEN AT LEAST EVERY 30-MINUTES FOR AN ALLOWABLE MINUMUM OF 15-MINUTES. IF THE BRIDGE IS NOT REPLACED PER THE ORIGINAL AGREEMENT WITH BRIGHTLINE, THE RAIL BRIDGE ""NEEDS"" TO BE PHYSICALLY ""MANNED"" TO REACT TO CONDITIONS/INCIDENTS THAT DEVELOPE AS A RESULT OF ITS CLOSURE AND IT MUST BE OPEN ON THE SAME SCHEDULE AS THE SR707 BRIDGE WHICH IS EVERY 20-MINUTES, MINIMUM OF 10-MINUTES PER OPENING. OF COURSE WE KNOW THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE BECAUSE THE TRAIN BRIDGE CLOSES 15-MINUTES BEFORE EACH TRAIN, A FREIGHT TRAIN TAKES 5-15 MINUTES TO PASS AND IT TAKES 10-15 MINUTES TO OPEN THE BRIDGE AFTER A TRAIN HAS PASSED. WITH 3-4 TRAINS PER HOUR, THE TRAIN BRIDGE WILL NEVER BE OPEN AND TRANSIT ON THIS WATERWAY WILL BE EFFECTIVELY SHUT DOWN.

(5) What challenges have you experienced when transiting this area due to these bridges and/or railway activity? LONG DELAYS AND DANGEROUS OVERCROWDING OF THE WATERWAY. MOST BOATERS ARE NOT VERY EXPERIENCED IN HANDLING BOATS IN CONFINED/CROWDED AREAS ESPECIALLY WITH THE NORMALLY STRONG CURRENTS AND CROSS WINDS PRESENT IN THIS AREA. THIS MEANS THEY TAKES CHANCES THEY SHOULDN'T. BOATS HAVE TO RUN AT FASTER THAN IDLE SPEEDS TO MAINTAIN CONTROL DUE TO THE NARROW WIDTH OF THE TRAIN BRIDGE, THE TURBULANCE AND THE CROSS WINDS. THIS CREATES MORE ISSUES WITH WAKES AND ADDED TURBULANCE.

(6) Is a 15 minute hourly opening schedule sufficient for marine traffic? If not, please explain why. NO AND ITS NOT REASONABLE! ON A NORMAL WEEKEND DAY, 15-MINUTES IS NOT ENOUGH TIME TO ALLOW ALL THE BOATS WAITING TO PASS. THIS WILL RESULT IN ACCIDENTS, DAMAGE TO BOATS, DAMAGE TO THE BRIDGE STRUCTURES, INJURIES AND MOST LIKELY MANY DEATHS. THE WATERWAY THROUGH THE TRAIN BRIDGE IS NARROW, THE WATER FLOW IS TURBULENT AND THE NARROW WIDTH CAN ACCOMODATE ONLY ONE BOAT IN A SINGLE DIRECTION AT ONE TIME. AS BOATERS TAKE CHANCES AND TRY TO PASS SIDE BY SIDE IN BOTH DIRECTIONS AT ONE TIME, THIS WILL CREATE THE DANGEROUS CONDITIONS AND ACCIDENTS NOTED ABOVE.

(7) Should the SR 707 (Dixie Hwy) Bridge opening schedule mirror the operating schedule of the FEC Railroad Bridge? NO. THE FEC BRIDGE OPENING SHOULD MIRROR THE SR 707 OPENING SCHEDULE. ALL OF THIS IS A RECIPE FOR DISATER. EITHER ONE OF THOSE TRAINS WILL FALL OFF THAT 97-YEAROLD BRIDGE OR WE WILL HAVE REPEATED ACCIDENTS AND INCIDENTS REQUIRING ALMOST CONSTANT MONITORING AND POLICING OF THE AREA ESPECIALLY ON WEEKENDS. ITS BAD NOW AND WHAT IS COMING WILL MAKE THE SITUATION UNBEARABLE. THIS WILL SHUT DOWN ACCESS AND TRANSPORTATION ON THE WATERWAY AND WILL HAVE A HUGE NEGATIVE EFFECT ON THE LIVES OF THE PEOPLE IN OUR COMMUNITIES, THE PROPERTY VALUES AND BUSINESSES WEST OF THE BRIDGES. THIS IS ABOUT THE ""FEW"" AND THEIR PROFITS HAVING MORE RIGHTS THAN THE MANY. ITS TIME TO END THE RAILRODS OVER STEPPING RIGHTS. THE COAST GUARD AND OUR ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES NEED TO STEP UP AND PROTECT ACCESS TO OUR WATERWAYS OVER THE GREEDY WANTS OF BRIGHTLINE. HOLD BRIGHTLINE TO AT LEAST THEIR ORIGINAL COMMITMENTS. THEY SHOULD HAVE RUN WEST AND NOT BROUGHT THIS DISATER TO ALL OF THE COMMUNITIES ALONG THE COAST. BRIGHTLINE TRAINS ARE ALREADY RESPONSIBLE FOR AT LEAST ONE DEATH PER MONTH NOW. IF THIS IS NOT FIXED RIGHT AND FIXED NOW, WE COULD HAVE ONE DEATH EVERY WEEKEND IN THIS AREA ALONE. FIX IT NOW OR WE WILL ALL SUFFER FOR A LONG TIME. MOST LIKELY THE ""RIGHT THING"" WONT HAPPEN UNTIL SOMEBODY OR MANY PEOPLE DIE FROM ALL OF THIS MESS. THATS TYPICALLY HOW THESE THINGS WORK. FIX IT NOW.

I am forming a Mariners Opposition group with an aim of protesting subject RR bridge at every stage.  As a former USN Search and Rescue Swimmer, I find this proposed plan and schedule to be of great risk to safety or mariners on the St. Lucie River.  Boat operators, personal and commercial utilize this waterway 24 hours a day.  A 15-minute open period is a major safety concern.  Sea Tow, Boat US, and the Sheriff’s office, all require more than 6 feet of clearance to navigate this waterway, moreover, 98% of vessels that navigate the St. Lucie River require more than 6 feet of clearance.  If the safety assets or Sheriff are on the wrong side of the bridge during a critical incident or accident, response time is a matter of life or DEATH!.  The Bridge must remain OPEN and close only when a train is passing.

The currently proposed operating schedule of the train bridge is unacceptable and will completely cut off boaters from the inlet and ICW. It will also create an unsafe bottle neck as the boaters trying to navigate the opening's short window will push situations closer and faster then they should be.  A more amicable time distribution needs to be worked out to prevent loss of business, safety related accidents and potential deaths.

Obviously the traffic in the area has grown over the years, in the ""old days' maybe you could get away with closing FEC bridge and only open it for 15 min per hour but the main reason we should not now is SAFETY.  Just last week I almost witnessed an accident when 707 bridge tender got in an argument  with several boats waiting on an opening , after waiting for another 30 min for an opening several more boats crammed in the tight area to pass the bridge and bounced off several pilings.   This problem will get compounded if the FEC bridge is closed 45 min every hour to add more vessels to get through on the hour.  Someone will get injured or worse.  As always it comes down the money.   For ""Safety""  I believe we should keep FEC bridge opening as it is now UNTIL......replacement bridge is built.

Thank you for giving the local tax-payers and boaters a chance to response to the terribly restrictive proposal on leaving the railroad bridge open for only 15 minutes per hour. This proposal is terribly restrictive and will result in concerns:
•	Safety will be compromised for too many boats will be forced to enter than exit that tight channel in a very short period of time… consider the width of this tight waterway, the current, the back up of boats both east and west of the bridge? 
•	Property values, many of us purchased homes in the area for ease of use for boating, more boaters are West of the Railroad bridge than I am sure passengers that would be using the Brightline train. The answer is not opening the bridge for 15 minutes an hour to allow boater to access the inter-coastal, Atlantic, etc... 
Solution:
•	The Rail Road Bridge needs to stay open 45 minutes an hour.
•	Limit the Brightline schedule to something reasonable 
•	Rebuild the bridge and infrastructure to consider boaters…. meaning the bridge needs to open and close much faster…. the channel needs to have more width…. the bridge needs to be higher and if progress is so important, don’t take shortcuts and restrict boating to an unreasonable level.
Thank you

•A schedule such as this reduces the appeal of living upriver of this bridge, forcing potential homeowners interested in boating to look elsewhere. This will essentially devalue all properties upriver of the bridge and almost all of Palm City Florida.
•Massive boat traffic jams will occur, causing a hazard to navigation, accidents and potential injury.
•This schedule will also hurt local businesses such as marinas & restaurants upriver of the bridge, as it will reduce the number of boats interested in transiting the bridge to patronize their facilities. Ultimately, this will cause a loss of jobs in the area.

YES

(2) How often do you transit this waterway? 

A COUPLE DAYS PER WEEK

(3) If railway traffic impedes your navigation of this area, how long are you normally delayed?

IF THERE IS A SINGLE TRAIN, WE ARE DELAYED 20 MINUTES PROVIDING US1 BRIDGE IS COORDINATING.
IF MORE THAN ONE TRAIN IT CAN BE AN HOUR AND HAS BEEN LONGER.

(4) How would you propose to regulate the balance of railway and maritime traffic in this area? 

BUILD THE APPROPRIATE INFRUSTRUCTURE LIKE OTHER FIRST WORLD COUNTRIES.

BUT AS A TEMPROARY BANDAIDE....
*AT THE VERY LEAST, THE RAILROAD BRIDGE NEEDS TO GO UP AND STAY UP WHENEVER THE US1 BRIDGE IS UP. EVERY 30 MINUTES DURING THE WEEK AND EVERY 20 MINUTES DURING THE WEEKENDS, AND NOT GOING BACK DOWN UNTIL ALL WAITING BOATS HAVE PASSED AND IT IS SAFE TO DO SO.

THIS IS NOT TO SAY THAT IT SHOULD GO DOWN WHEN THE US1 BRIGE IS DOWN. THAT STILL WONT BE ENOUGH. TOO MANY BOATS NEED THE TRAIN BRIDGE UP YET DONT NEED US1 UP. 

SO THE TRAIN BRIDGE (IMHO)  NEEDS TO STAY UP AT LEAST 30-40 CONSECUTIVE MINUTES PER HOUR AND ALWAYS WHEN THE US1 BRIDGE IS UP. 

THIS WILL SOMEWHAT RELIEVE THE HEAVILY CONGESTED AND DANGEROUS CONDITION  AT THE BRIDGE.
IT ALSO ALLOWS THE BOATS THAT REQUIRE THE US1 BRIDGE OPENING TO PASS AS WELL, AGAIN CALMING THE CONGESTION AND PREVENTING SUCH A DANGEROUS CONDITION. 

(5) What challenges have you experienced when transiting this area due to these bridges and/or railway activity?

BESIDES THE VERY LONG WAIT TIMES I HAVE HAD 2 OTHER BOATS COLLIDE INTO MY BOAT BETWEEN THE TRAIN BRIDGE AND THE US1 DRAWBRIDGE.
IT IS A DISASTER AS IT IS, CURRENTLY.
 
THE FACT THAT THERE IS EVEN A PROPOSAL TO MAKE IT WORSE IS ASININE.

(6) Is a 15 minute hourly opening schedule sufficient for marine traffic? If not, please explain why.

ABSOLUTLY NOT. 
AS EXPLAINED ABOVE WE ARE ALREADY OVERLY CONGESTED AND IT IS ALREADY A DANGEROUS CONDITION. YOUR PROPOSAL TO FURTHER BOTTLE NECK THE TRAFFIC IN THE NARROW CHANNEL AND STRONG CURRENT EVEN LONGER IS MORE DANGEROUS TO BOATERS.

(7) Should the SR 707 (Dixie Hwy) Bridge opening schedule mirror the operating schedule of the FEC Railroad Bridge?

NOT NECESSARILY ""MIRROR"" BUT THE TRAIN BRIDGE NEEDS TO BE UP ""AT THE VERY LEAST"" WHEN THE USI BRIDGE IS UP.

OTHERWISE, IT LEAVES THE LARGER BOATS CONGESTING THE NARROW CHANNELS WITH STRONG CURRENTS AS WELL AS MUCH LONGER D WAIT TIMES, AND MORE ADDED FRUSTRATION.

It blows my mind why a new bridge has not already begun construction, the FEC and Brightline are waiting for public grant money...
I say BS to that!
These are two very large companies that profit off these rails, they do not let me ship or ride for free, why should we fund this? They need to go and float a loan like the rest of us if they cannot write a check. 
There should be no additional train traffic that will add any additional closures until this rust bucket of an antique bridge is replaced with the one being planned for. 
Brightline and the FEC need to slow down their other endeavors and focus on this new bridge. 
How can they be allowed to add more trains with this type of infrastructure??

This plan is not workable because the build up of boats would be great from either entrance. If you take any large craft you see that only one boat at a time can proceed. The allocation of time will not be enough. Second problem is the road bridge, that has to be in sequence that both bridges will operate at same time. Last will be amount of trains to go over a single bridge. We understand that you will have over 35 trains each day. This can cause major backup if you have traffic from either direction. If this occurs we understand that the sequence of Brightline trains  could make the time be back to back. Meaning in a hr they could put two 45 minutes together and have 1hr 30 minutes than another 15 allowed for boats that would create a very  large amount of boats waiting to pass through the waterway.

Yes

(2) How often do you transit this waterway?  Varies, but as many as several times per week.

(3) If railway traffic impedes your navigation of this area, how long are you normally delayed?  Under the current circumstance, which involves only freight train traffic, it could be 20 to 30 minutes to well over an hour dependent on the particular train. Bear in mind, the current situation involves the train bridge span being open the majority of the time, with closings being the exception.  This allows regular boat traffic ample opportunity to transverse the area.  Adding the proposed schedule for passenger traffic trains reverses the default situation to a closed bridge the majority of the time, with openings being the exception.  This will result in assured gridlock, and chaos will ensue during the limited bridge openings at this bottle-neck.

(4) How would you propose to regulate the balance of railway and maritime traffic in this area?  Consider the true volume of the already existing maritime traffic, and adjust the proposed passenger railway traffic to that reality, not the other way around; or replace the current ""old"" train bridge and its rail system to accommodate its proposed use for high frequency passenger trains, and address both issues at hand - significant disruption of boat traffic and train passenger safety. The current proposal does neither.  On May 20, 2022, a freight train derailed a few miles north of the bridge central to this proposed regulation.  Fortunately it was only gravel onboard, not Brightline passengers.

(5) What challenges have you experienced when transiting this area due to these bridges and/or railway activity?  Backed up boat traffic awaiting the bridge opening, culminating with impatient boaters exhibiting unsafe behavior as they rush to get through an opening bridge, or worse, trying to beat a closing bridge.

(6) Is a 15 minute hourly opening schedule sufficient for marine traffic?  Not at all. This is the only transit point to the St. Lucie River, Intracoastal Waterway, and St Lucie Inlet for all boat traffic from the Okeechobee Waterway, the South Fork and North Forks of the St Lucie River, and the canal systems of Port St. Lucie in St. Lucie County.  This will adversely impact thousands of waterfront residents of Martin and St. Lucie Counties, as well as hundreds of additional boat owners berthing the vessels at marinas located in the South Fork and North Forks of the St Lucie River.  The current situation involves the train bridge span being open the majority of the time, with closings being the exception.  This allows boat traffic to flow through the area naturally the majority of the time, with back-ups only occurring whenever a train is transiting the area, which is the exception.  The proposed train bridge schedule reverses the default situation to a closed bridge the majority of the time, with openings being the exception.  This train bridge span is particularly low, and does not allow passage for most boats, only certain skiffs and flats boats will fit under the closed bridge span, but I would not consider it particularly safe or advisable.  So in essence, you will be halting virtually all boat traffic for 45 minutes of every hour,  causing numerous boats to back up on both sides of the bridge, particularly on weekends and holidays.  As the bridge begins to open or close, all those impatient boaters will rush to get through, without particular regard for reduced speed, right of way, or courtesy, otherwise they risk getting stuck for another 45 minutes.  This will certainly result in serious safety issues.  Consider how many people get hurt or killed trying to beat a crossing train on land.  You will inevitably see a water-borne version of this as people try to beat train bridge closings.

(7) Should the SR 707 (Dixie Hwy) Bridge opening schedule mirror the operating schedule of the FEC Railroad Bridge?  Yes it should, but not based on the proposed 45 minutes closed, and 15 minute open schedule.",,,,,,,

I do it as many as five time a week. I cannot transit the bridge without the bridge being open.

If the bridge is to be closed for half an hour for each train that crosses it, then with the proposed number of passenger and freight trains, the bridge will be closed all the time.  Many of the bridges in South Florida are on a schedule. Usually bridges open on the hour and half hour or the quarter and three quarter hour. This kind of schedule allows both FECRR and maritime interests set time to transit.  Anything less than an opening every half hour WHEN REQUESTED by boats would severely inhibit the vessel's right to navigate the river,

Already you can observe large congregations of boats waiting on the bridge. There is a strong current in the area which makes it difficult very difficult for most vessels to hold position, and this gets worse as and limits maneuvering.
If you really want to see how busy the boat traffic is you need to preform a traffic study on a beautiful Saturday and Sunday. My son and I use this passageway every Monday for a quick trip out and back to get bait for the weekend. My family uses this opening almost every weekend. The boats are always backed up. We saw a large boat back over his tender and sink it, attempting not to run into the railroad bridge during a long weight on a busy Friday night as boats attempted to cross through before the railroad bridge went down again. He was pretty much blocked in due to the large gathering of boats waiting for an opening. 
This bridge serves as a MAJOR thoroughfare for not only the 10’s of thousands of people that live on the west side of the bridge, but it’s the ONLY route to Lake Okeechobee and the west coast of Florida, for people on the East side of the bridge
The current bridge is extremely old and concerning to boaters in the area. It has experienced problems in recent years leaving us at one time stuck on the wrong side for over 4 hours and is well beyond its expected life. This bridge will likely not withstand opening and closing multiple times each hour. We were told that Brightline would be replacing this bridge and now it seems to not be the case. This bridge needs to be replaced with a wider and taller railroad bridge. This would allow more than one boat to safely cross at a time and reduce the need for as many openings.

Why should the train take precedence over the maritime boaters? It is going to be so dangerous if you do this and it will ruin the boating community in Palm City and parts of Stuart.

What happens when the bridge is closed and there is an emergency that requires the Sheriff's department, Sea Tow or Boat US to respond to one side or the other? Add to this the massive backup of boaters waiting for the bridge to open and the mad rush to get through within the 15 minutes. The passage through the train bridge is narrow and there will be accidents occurring on a regular basis as everyone makes a dash through the opening before the bridge closes. I propose an opposite schedule. The bridge must remain open for 45 minutes per hour and only schedule trains to transit over the bridge for 15 minutes every hour. Even this should only be a temporary solution. The permanent solution is to build a new train bridge with a minimum high tide clearance of 16 feet to allow the majority of vessels to travel unimpeded. ",,,,,,,

Additionally the bridge activation has been extremely slow over the past years.  Sometime it's down 15 minutes before the freight train arrives.  This is a 100 year old trestle   built for several trains per day at best to pass not what Briteline has proposed.  This trestle should be rebuilt.  If it fails it will shut down not only the rail but the waterway as well.  At the least it should be rebuilt, raised with a second rail and a double lift to accommodate two way train and boat traffic.  The current plan appears to be a minimalistic approach that will have a poor result.  Once it's approved and in use it's too late for the proper modification.  Additionally this passenger train gives nothing back to our lovely community.  I'm not in favor of this plan as proposed.

We keep our boat at The Riverside/Loggerheads Marina on the West side of the Roosevelt bridge. We pass through the Drawbridge in question 10-15 times a week to access the Port Salerno, ICW and the Ocean via the St. Lucie Inlet. The drawbridge in question is relatively  easy to access today, as it is open at all times unless a train comes through. The bright line train and keeping the drawbridge closed would create an extreme hardship for us. The are under the bridges (there are three bridges to negotiate) is often crowded as it is. Many boats have to wait in place as the various bridges are lowered an raised. We are fortunate in that with the railway bridge always open (other when there is a train) we don’t need to wait for the other drawbridge next to the train bridge to open. We fit underneath as do many many boats. If the railway bridge is kept closed with periodic openings, the amount of boats waiting for two bridges to open, will increase dramatically and there is bound to be increased boat collisions as there is not a lot of area to maneuver. I would move my slip to the East Side of the bridges, but there are basically few to no slips available, which is why we are West of the bridge currently. 

I really believe the CG, of which I’m a big supporter, is making a huge mistake.

I am writing out of concern for the potential change in the opening schedule of the St Lucie railroad bridge as a result of the Brightline train schedule.  
As you maybe aware the  distance between the railroad bridge abutments are minimal and under the best of circumstances would allow for 2 directional
passage  for boats less then 25 feet with competent captains at the helm.  The current between the abutments is fast and capricious except at slack tide.
Many times it is challenging to maintain steerage at the required minimal wake speeds.  This is under the best of circumstances.  When the inevitable rain and thunder storms hit it will be a very dangerous situation to have boats stacked up in areas of limited space waiting for the bridge to open.  There needs to be
regular access at 20 minute intervals during times of higher use.   Beyond that having the bridge open at 20 minute intervals would allow firetrucks, police, and ambulances to cross the tracks.  How many people are going to die because of this train?",,,,,,,

Opening every hour for 15 minutes will greatly impair passage of boats and result in logjams of boats on either side of the bridge.  The bridge is currently automatic and opens and closes as trains approach the bridge.  There is no cogent reason to change this operational schedule.  This bridge was supposed to get a $100 million upgrade which was nixed by Brightline.  When the bridge is down the clearance is less than 10 feet and even the smallest of boats cannot pass.  This is a bad plan and should be abandoned as it lacks merit and will greatly inconvenience boat traffic and result in the burning of fuel needlessly while idling and waiting for the bridge to open.",,,,,,,

about 45 minutes
(4) How would you propose to regulate the balance of railway and maritime traffic in this area?
Restrict rail traffic to no more than 1 crossing over the bridge every 4 hours
(5) What challenges have you experienced when transiting this area due to these bridges and/or railway activity?
Holding station in the heavy current with numerous boats waiting for the opening. Once the bridge opens, traffic stacked in both directions are competing for a small channel under the bridges
(6) Is a 15 minute hourly opening schedule sufficient for marine traffic? If not, please explain why
If the schedule started at 8pm it would be sufficient if it stopped at 5am. Outside of that window there is too much boat traffic that would stack up. It would be a safety issue with boats trying to scramble through a narrow passage before the 15 minute window expired.

I’ve seen tight and unsafe water traffic through the strong currents of both of these bridges due to the combination of inexperienced boaters and the strong current that are generated as water moves through the tight openings. And that’s with the current schedule which is predominantly open.

These hazardous conditions would exponentially multiply as boats gather and wait for passage and then rush to make the 15 minute window…

An objective quantitative study of traffic flow through the waterway should be conducted over a statistically significant time frame ( including holidays and seasonal impacts ) to determine if there is any amount of time ( open 20,30 week days and 45mins weekend ) or some more equitable time share… there is a good chance that data will conclude that even a more equitable time allotment per hour will be unacceptably restrictive and unsafe.


In reality and likely what the data will lead to is that a new bridge should be constructed in parallel or the current RR Bridge should be upgraded to reduce the impact to the community and businesses west of the Bridge. There is also value to a new bridge of avoided maintenance. The existing bridge is long past it’s designed life and increasing its usage is going to lead to costly and time consuming maintenance ( which could lead to the bridge being closed for long periods at a time which would be unacceptable  )… it’s like taking a classic car and using it as a 150 mile a day commuter… doesn’t pass the common sense check.

Please fight to stop this legislation from passing so that our waterway stays safe and viable, housing values are not impacted, and business west of the bridge stay in operation.",,,,,,,

When the bridge is closing or closed upon my arrival, the delay is typically about 15 minutes and throughout the wait time other vessels on both sides of the bridge begin to ""stack-up"" in a disorganized que awaiting the opening of the bridge.  Once the bridge finally opens, many boats struggle to share the narrow one-way passage under the bridge.  At most times there is an extreme tidal current flowing through this area making it very unsafe for navigation through the narrow passage of both the FEC Railroad  Bridge and the Dixie Hwy bridge.  With the railroad bridge currently open for the majority of time, it is difficult enough to transit this area and even more difficult during the heavy weekend traffic.   I believe there is a serious error in concluding that a 15 minute hourly opening would be sufficient to allow safe and effective navigation through this area, especially during the weekends.  There will be so many vessels stacked up on both sides of the bridge that they will never make it through within the 15 minute interval.  The larger vessels, which there are many, would certainly take up a significant portion of the 15 minute time interval as they struggle there way through the masses of smaller vessels.  I think it is also unreasonable to expect that the hundreds or maybe thousands of vessels passing through this area in a given day can plan their routes to arrive at the bridge during such a small 15 minute window.  While it would certainly help the boaters to know when the bridge will be open, it must be open for a reasonable amount of time and frequency.  15 minutes per hour is not reasonable and besides being extremely inconvenient, I am sure it will lead to many accidents and likely many injuries.  A reasonable solution would be to split the time equally between open and closed bridges.  Either a 1/2 hour open every hour or two 15 minute periods open every hour.  With the number of boats traversing this area, and that number increasing dramatically every year, I do not believe the proposed total open time of 25% is sufficient to allow the throughput.  I have 45 years of boating experience and hold a USCG Near-Coastal Masters License, and in my opinion, this proposed rule will have devastating consequences.  The railroad bridge itself is a serious safety hazard with its ~100 year age and condition and its very narrow passageway.  The obvious right solution is to rebuild the bridge at a higher and wider level, but we are all aware of the funding issues.  In the meantime, I sincerely hope that the new rule will establish a 50% open time for the bridge.",,,,,,,

(1) Do you currently transit through the FEC Railroad Bridge crossing the Okeechobee Waterway, mile 7.4, at Stuart, Florida?
Yes, i do transit the FEC Railroad bridge at mile 7.4


(2) How often do you transit this waterway?
I transit this bridge area out and back about 4 times each week, which equates to an average of 8 transits/week

(3) If railway traffic impedes your navigation of this area, how long are you normally delayed?
I find two items terribly frustrating about this rail road bridge. The first frustration is that when the bridge is down, or as often happens to me, stuck in the down position there is no one on site nor reachable to find out when it will open. The second frustration i have is with the warning signal that the bridge is closing. If I arrive at the bridge and hear 4 blasts from a horn, i cannot tell if this was the first, second, third or fourth sequence of blasts. I think it would be much better if each sequence of blasts had a different, increasing number of blasts. 

(4) How would you propose to regulate the balance of railway and maritime traffic in this area?
I would man the bridge so there is someone on VHF marine radio who can broadcast when the bridge might close. I would change the blast sequence to warn boaters how long before the bridge closes and would not leave the bridge down longer than required. 

(5) What challenges have you experienced when transiting this area due to these bridges and/or railway activity?

(6) Is a 15 minute hourly opening schedule sufficient for marine traffic? If not, please explain why.
If you want complete mayhem and an unaccepbly high number of boat collisions during the 15 minute open window, then go right ahead. The narrow chanel is busy enough during the current random schedule. There is zero chance that you could get all of the boats (on a nice day) through the narrows in a 15 minute widow without serious boat crashes and loss of life.

(7) Should the SR 707 (Dixie Hwy) Bridge opening schedule mirror the operating schedule of the FEC Railroad Bridge?
I think a 15 minute window/hour would seriously impede recreational and commercial traffic on this waterway and would be unacceptable. I would like to know what happened to the idea of raising the railway bridge to permit boat traffic to pass, similar to the Dixie Hwy bridge.",,,,,,,

     I genuinely appreciate the service you provide in keeping boaters safe on our nations' waterways. As a former service member, I understand the sacrifice and difficulties associated with such service. And in that spirit, I implore you to fully consider how this proposal directly opposes the USCG mission of keeping our waterways safe for the boating public. 

     I am a boat and home owner in Stuart and my boat is docked on the west side of the railroad bridge. I transit this passage many times a week. As you are well aware, this passage area is quite narrow and, nearly all the time, is subject to heavy currents. This already makes navigation in this area a challenge. And then when you factor in the closing of the railroad bridge (which allows only the smallest of watercraft to pass when closed), large amounts of boat traffic can queue up while waiting for the bridge to finish it's cycle. Once the bridge opens, irritated boaters all charge for one small passage. This is ALREADY a tense situation which heightens the inherent risks of boating. Creating a situation that could lead to likely wait times in excess of 30 minutes and large groups of boats of vastly different sizes and capabilities trying to hold position in an area subject to exceptionally strong currents is a guarantee of disaster.

     In my opinion and the opinion of many other boaters in the area, the navigation of this area is already a dangerous situation which needs to be improved by implementing a predictable schedule, better signaling / marking, and more efficient use of time by reducing the time margin the bridge closes before the train arrives. This proposal not only does nothing to make the situation better, it's only possible result is to make this situation significantly worse.

     If this proposal is implemented, it is only a matter of time before a loss of life brings this decision into question. ",,,,,,,

My family  uses the waterway that travels through the FEC Railway at least once a week.  We have been sitting at the train bridge more often for 30 - 45 min sometimes with no train coming.  We were aware that the train bridge would be down more frequently as Brightline inched closer to operation.  Our biggest concern is safety when all the boats begin to stack up especially on the weekend after all the Sun and fun of the day.  The longer the wait, the more boats and the more concern over space between the boats as we wait.  Then, there is the mad dash to get through after waiting for so long.  It would be helpful to have access to a schedule for the train bridge so we can be proactive in coming to the bridge.  For those of us that plan accordingly, we could avoid the stacking of boats in between the bridges and reduce concerns over safety.  For Palm City, St Lucie County that uses the North Fork and Okeechobee Waterway to the Locks,  this is a critical juncture for travel.

1. Guarantees 45 minutes per hour of boater access and no more than 15 minutes per hour of the train bridge in the down position restricting waterway access.

2. Does not allow the train bridge to operate closing the waterway a period of time at the end of one hour period abutted to closing the water at the beginning of the next hour period, thereby connecting the bridge closed periods of time. 

3. Clearly defines what each hourly period is as to remove all ambiguity of when an hourly period begins and ends.

4. Gives further increased boater access above 45 minutes per hour to the waterway on weekends and federal holidays.

FYI:
12-14= the current average  number of freight trains per day over the St. Lucie train bridge.

15 minutes= the amount of time the train bridge is closed, at minimum, to boaters for each train that passes.

32= the number of Brightline trains which will go over the train bridge each day.

46= the number of trains closing the St. Lucie river to boaters each day.

*If the U.S. Coast Guard were to allow the Train bridge to be in the down position, closing the waterway to boaters for 45 minutes an hour, as the U.S. Coast Guard inquired about doing, the narrow passage would become very dangerous for backed up boaters colliding with one another.

Additionally, the U.S. Coast Guard stated they wish to provide certainty to boaters  for when they can access the waterway. Under no circumstance, should certainty as to which window of time boaters can access the water way be a substitute for the quantity of time boaters have to access the waterway each hour. Again boaters, having the right of way should have 45 minutes an hour of access. 

This should also not be considered to be an average of hours that boaters are given access where the community is told there are less trains crossing the waterway from midnight to 5am, so that would “count as increased boater access.”

Keeping the bridge closed for 45 minutes an hour is simply wrong?  This area of the river is  traversed by many recreational and commercial vessels each day/hour. The bridge area is a dangerous bottleneck with strong currents under the current train bridge schedule. When the railroad bridge is closed, it creates a serious traffic backup,  maintaining a safe boating distances from other vessels is magnified and controlling one's vessel in the strong currents around the bridge will cause serious potential life threatening accidents.

If the railroad bridge is only open for 15 minutes an hour, imagine the rush of boat traffic trying to ""make the bridge opening"" each hour. This is a recipe for disaster with potentially lethal consequences. 

 This proposed change will cause boat / property owners to give up their freedoms of reasonable access to our waterways for both east and west bound vessels? 
A 45 minute an hour closing of the waterway is simply unacceptable and I respectfully request that this request be denied!  If building a new bridge is not an option (as was promised to our community!), please do not close the railroad bridge for more than 20 minutes an hour.

Then when the bridge opens, boat traffic coming from both directions and a VERY narrow opening creates an extremely hazardous situation.

We would be looking at a major increase in boating accidents in that area and add to the death toll that Brightline has accumulated in its short existence.

That number has also been multiplied by the thousands as well for new vessel owners on the water. A lot of boaters out here now are very  unexperienced at what they’re doing. So adding that to a congested waterway with a strong constant current just causes multiple accidents. I watch it weekly out here as I’m on water passing through that bridge multiple times a week. 

As a lot of the boaters are lacking maritime knowledge and rule, a lot of these accidents go unreported which gives the coast guard no knowledge of what’s actually happening. I’ve watched and handful of bigger boats pass through the car bridge and the train bridge now stats to close. Big boat has no option other to power through and hope they don’t not hit the bridge or any other vessel. Which I have now witnessed a handful of times. Sailboats breaking masts as the bridge closes, sportfish plowing smaller boats out the way so they do not get caught under the bridge as it closing, and so on. 

Due to the amount of boating traffic, that bridge needs to open a minimum 35min a day. I know the bridge needs to be down and set way before the train gets there due to how long a train needs to stop. I believe that remaining time of the 35 minutes is plenty of time for it to be down for a train. Especially the bright line with how fast it travels. 

As for the traffic bridge, it does not need to be on the same schedule as the train bridge. That will only cause unnecessary traffic back ups with the already growing number of vehicles on the road down here.

From what I remember Brightline was supposed to build a brand new bridge here to replace the rusty old relic that is there now. Clearly deeper pockets have stopped that. You are putting this out here to be our voice, so let’s hope you listen and can do this. ",,,,,,,

The bascule bridge located just south of the RR bridge currently opens on demand 2X/hour on weekdays and 3X/hour on weekends. There are safety issues with limiting access ,that if ignored, will probably lead to property damage and injuries.
This location has a strong current, shifting winds and limited visibility. If the RR bridge is opened only for 15 minutes there will be accidents as boats jockey to get through.
Property values in all the communities to the west of the bridge will suffer. Intercoastal traffic between the east and west coasts will be compromised. 

My opinion is that the Brightline project is simply a cover to acquire federal money to enhance a private freight line. The project will fail due to lack of interest in this passenger rail fiasco but it will damage local communities and cause injuries and fatalities as 80mph trains try to roar through areas not set up to handle them.",,,,,,,

I do not think a 15 minute hourly opening schedule is sufficient for the situation. Mainly because with the limited 6’ clearance of the railroad bridge in the lowered position very few boats will be able to transit, creating a huge bottleneck of boat traffic. Also the amount of time it takes to raise and lower the antiquated RR bridge is of concern. Will the bridge actually open for 15 minutes or does the opening and closing time count in their 15 minutes? Additionally, this bottleneck of boat traffic presents potentially dangerous situations, as there is not enough maneuvering ability, there is shoaling, narrow passages, and strong currents at times.

In summary, as an owner of a sailboat that has been transiting through the Roosevelt bridge and the FEC railroad bridge for over twenty years, I have huge concerns about increased traffic on an antiquated railroad bridge, with minimal clearance (6’) in the down position. This bridge was not designed for the increased use being demanded and its design creates severe restrictions to boater egress when in use.

Pedestrians and motor vehicles access to cross the tracks in designated areas is granted when the FEC agrees such easements. If motorist and pedestrians find this unacceptable they are allowed to tunnel under or bridge over the private land as to not interfere with the train operations.
Waterways such as the OWW and inland rivers are owned by the people of the United States of America. Long before private and corporate railways existed, the waterways were never to be blocked for any mount of time.to water vessel navigation. This is why all drawbridges must yield to floating vessels on demand.
 With the tremendous amount of boating traffic passing through the St. Luice/ Okeechobee Waterway, the current FEC owned drawbridge can not operate at a speed ( raising and lowering ) adequate to accommodate the boat traffic in this publicly owned waterway. With that said the FEC railroad does have 3, well, 4 options: 1) Install a high speed drawbridge with very little interruption to waterway traffic. 2) Bridge over the water at the minimum height of 55 feet at mean tide like all motor vehicle fixed bridges. 3) Tunnel under the waterway that would not interfere with the channel depth. 4) Which is illegal but happens often enough, sometimes called ""mitigation"" where FEC makes a deal with government(s) and individual entities to do what they ask for and the water traffic suffers the consequences. FEC and the U.S. Coast Guard know what needs to be done to protect the people of the United States and their rights. The laws on this subject have been in place for hundreds of years. Lets follow them this time.",,,,,,,

(1) Do you currently transit through the FEC Railroad Bridge crossing the Okeechobee Waterway, mile 7.4, at Stuart, Florida?  Yes, I personally use the Dixie Highway bridge utilizing a motor vehicle, and I also navigate under both bridges as part of my recreational boating.

(2) How often do you transit this waterway? Motor Vehicle - 20+ times per week, Navigating by boat 3-4 times monthly.

(3) If railway traffic impedes your navigation of this area, how long are you normally delayed?  It seems that I have to wait 2-3 times per week anywhere from 1 minute to as long as 20 minutes depending on the time of day and when I approach the bridges.

(4) How would you propose to regulate the balance of railway and maritime traffic in this area?  Maritime traffic effects many more people locally than the railway traffic, in fact a high percentage of the railway traffic that disrupts our life is not intended for our county but for other parts of Florida. Locally, the train causes both motor vehicle back ups and maritime issues.  When the current train bridge is down, less than 10% of boats are able to navigate safely, and it has a prolonged operations.  I favor the local community over those using the corridor to get somewhere else.  

(5) What challenges have you experienced when transiting this area due to these bridges and/or railway activity?  The Dixie highway bridge is manageable for vehicle traffic under its current system.  The major issues are the 1 hour of rush hour in the morning and afternoon.   Unfortunately the train bridge is another issue.  Luckily right now FEC sends most of its trains through at hours that has little to no maritime traffic.  The train bridge is slower in operation than Dixie Bridge, and the opening does not accommodate maritime traffic that is influenced by tidal changes.  Maritime traffic can take 45 minute's to clear on a busy boating day after a train bridge is down.  

(6) Is a 15 minute hourly opening schedule sufficient for marine traffic? If not, please explain why. No, especially on the weekends, when the train bridge has been down, it can take up to 45 minutes for the back up of maritime traffic to clear out.  By an 15 minute opening, I interpret that as the bridge will be up 15 minutes and down 45 minutes every hour.  This is not enough time to clear the maritime traffic that backs up when it is closed.

(7) Should the SR 707 (Dixie Hwy) Bridge opening schedule mirror the operating schedule of the FEC Railroad Bridge?  No, the height restrictions on both bridges are different.  While my boat will safely navigate under the Dixie bridge while down, it will not while the train bridge is down.  The number of people being affected when the train bridge is down, far outweighs the number of people who are going to be passenger riders on the train.   

opinion:
The hardship that Brightline is causing by not following through on their promises continues to add up.  This train should have been routed to the West and not on a system that already taxes local resources.  We are a water based community and any additional closing puts additional stress on a local issue.  Water was here before the cars and trains.  We use it for earning wages and for recreation.  It is our town, but I am sure the folks in Miami or Tallahassee or Washington DC really don't care about the small population that calls this home.  It already feels like a classic case of the few getting trampled on by big business.   We already battle toxic water from Okeechobee, now we have to battle just trying to get from one side of the bridge to the other.",,,,,,,

I'm a local maritime professional and engage in contracted work out of the St. Lucie inlet. Many of the boats that I operate and engage with are located west of the train bridge, so I can speak from personal experience. As it stands now, during our 30-minute delays for the drawbridge, we can have north of 20 to 30 boats waiting during peak hours. Please keep in mind these are vessels limited by the height restriction of the drawbridge, not the train bridge. While this may seem acceptable, I've also experienced what happens when both bridges are down for an extended period of time. While I've seen delays north of an hour, even at 30 minutes the stack of boats can easily exceed 50 vessels on both sides of the bridge. Frustration can quickly rise amongst the crowd and the mad dash for the small opening becomes dangerous quite rapidly when the bridges are raised. Often, the large crowd of smaller vessels ""plugs"" the gap, leaving the larger vessels (who are often more informed and prepared for the bridge's opening) left wanting. I can only envision the sharp increase in boating-related accidents as you continue to limit access to an extremely crucial route not only for our local boaters but for those navigating across the state. 

Boating is a cornerstone of the Stuart/Palm City economy, lifestyle, and branding. It is engaged in by an absolutely massive number of residents every single day. Why would you bet on Brightline to be an economic stimulus and cultural staple when you already have a perfectly established core of this municipality?  We're a fishing and boating town, filled with families that spend their money locally and are invested in the betterment of our community. I'm not sure exactly what goal Brightline is trying to solve, but I cannot imagine it is the best answer.

I will make a submittal  that addresses the questions raised before the end of the comment period, but this comment relates to the process being followed for the rulemaking.
The PRN describes a “…Waterways Analysis and  Management System (WAMS) review of the Intracoastal Waterway from miles 925–1005 in 2018. The WAMS included a focused review of the railroad bridges over the St Lucie River (OWW) and Loxahatchee River.”
“U.S. Coast Guard Captain of the Port Miami, based on the WAMS, recommended the regulation for the railroad bridge be changed to allow for reasonable usage of competing modes of transportation and provide a predictable opening schedule.”
Later in the FR notice, the statement is made:” To view documents mentioned in this proposed rule as being available in the docket, find the docket as described in the previous paragraph, and then select ‘‘Supporting & Related Material’’ in the Document Type column.”
From the clear words of the FR Notice, it is clear that the WAMS review formed the basis for the rulemaking, and therefore this review should be available for public review. On June 5, 2022, I therefore I requested a copy of the document, or a link to it, from Ms. Jennifer Zercher, Bridge Management Specialist, Seventh Coast Guard District.  On June 6, Ms. Zercher responded to my request:  
“ Unfortunately the study is not readily available to the public. However you can submit a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request using the following website - USCG CGMIX FOIA Requests”
This is a completely unacceptable response.  The Administrative Procedures Act requires that agencies provide meaningful opportunity for the public to comment on the rule’s content . When there is only one document that informs the agency about the issues, and it is not made available for public scrutiny, the public is denied the opportunity to provide “meaningful comments”.   Informing the public that they may submit a Freedom-of-Information Act request for the document is also not acceptable, inasmuch as FOIA requests can take months, or even years to result in the release of any documents.  This rulemaking comment period closes on July 5, and it is unlikely that there would be a substantive response to  FOIA request by that time.

The proposal for opening the bridge for 15min per hour raises many safety concerns.     
1. The passageway through the railroad bridge is narrow, often allowing for only 1 vessel at a time.   
2. The currents are strong, adding to the risk.    
3. Many boaters are returning from a day of fishing and sandbar, patience is often lost.    
4.  No way these boaters follow the No Wake rules, adding wake to the current issues.    Imagine 30+ boats lined up on the East and West side for a single lane passage.   

Allowing a short window for passage per hour seems an unreasonable expectation, neglectful even.   

Keep the current schedule.   Brightline can pause for the passage until a new bridge can be built.    Otherwise, you are putting your boating community at risk for the fortunes of a private transportation profit.   ",,,,,,,

(1) Do you currently transit through the FEC Railroad Bridge crossing the Okeechobee Waterway, mile 7.4, at Stuart, Florida?  I live on the C24 canal which is west of the railroad bridge.

(2) How often do you transit this waterway?  I transit this waterway up to twice per week.

(3) If railway traffic impedes your navigation of this area, how long are you normally delayed?
In the past, I have had to wait 30 minutes  for the railroad bridge to open.

(4) How would you propose to regulate the balance of railway and maritime traffic in this area?  Having a known posted schedule would greatly improve my ability to plan my travel and not have to wait for the bridge to reopen.  However, I am concerned with the proposal to have the bridge open for only 15 minutes each hour.  While I like the schedule, I believe there will be times where there is considerable traffic trying to get through during the relatively short 15 minute window.  The waterway under the railroad bridge is fairly narrow and given the wide spectrum of boating experience, there are times when only one vessel may transit the bridge at a time.  The small opening window will lead to difficulties in boaters trying to get through especially when the larger vessels want to transit.  I would think a 30 minute window, on a schedule, would provide adequate opportunity for marine traffic.

(5) What challenges have you experienced when transiting this area due to these bridges and/or railway activity?  As stated above, often I have had to wait for opposing traffic to clear either due to the size of the vessels, the current and/or the lack of experience of the other operators.  Sometimes vessels wait between the railroad bridge and the Roosevelt bridge, resulting in further traffic difficulties.

(6) Is a 15 minute hourly opening schedule sufficient for marine traffic? If not, please explain why.  I believe there will be times when there is a large amount of boat traffic which will be challenged to transit the bridge within the 15 minute window.  There are often large boats transiting, which often requires taking turns as the railroad bridge path is relatively narrow.  In addition, the tidal current can add to the challenge of making the transit.

(7) Should the SR 707 (Dixie Hwy) Bridge opening schedule mirror the operating schedule of the FEC Railroad Bridge?  I would imagine that if the schedules were not synchronized that further delays would occur.  As it happens my boat does not require Roosevelt to open, though in the past, I had a 53ft motor yacht that did require the opening.  There are many large boats in the marinas to the west of the bridge as well as the traffic intending to use the canal to cross Florida.

I would like to add that it is quite disappointing to hear there this proposal given that the early information regarding Brightline was that a new railroad bridge was to be constructed.  The new bridge was said to have a 35ft minimum height and a 65ft maximum height.  I believe this solution would satisfy most boaters.  Many boats would always now fit under the railroad bridge.  The smaller boats would then, not add to the traffic situation related to the larger boats that need the 65ft height.",,,,,,,

Yes, very often

(2) How often do you transit this waterway?
 A few times a week and every weekend 

(3) If railway traffic impedes your navigation of this area, how long are you normally delayed? Usually delayed about 30 Minutes to an Hour due to railroad bridge delays or one bridge opened and another closed. 

(4) How would you propose to regulate the balance of railway and maritime traffic in this area? Maintain a schedule that doesn’t affect traffic -for example: railroad should stick to a late schedule; all boat ramps are usually closed by sunset which reduces water traffic. Giving free time for the railroad 
Then open and close at the 15th and 45th 
Not right at 5 pm or 5:30 
I believe this is how it is now 4:45 and 5:30 opening 
Which I have caught and been delayed more times than not due to inlet traffic or weather planning 

(5) What challenges have you experienced when transiting this area due to these bridges and/or railway activity? Time changes or schedule hasn’t been consistent and has clashed with the other bridge causing a 45-1 hr delay

(6) Is a 15 minute hourly opening schedule sufficient for marine traffic? If not, please explain why. 
A 30 minute schedule is sufficient - I can plan if I have the schedule 
My boat has an 20 ft clearance and I currently play the tide game in the canal up stream


(7) Should the SR 707 (Dixie Hwy) Bridge opening schedule mirror the operating schedule of the FEC Railroad Bridge? These 2 bridges should have a similar or close schedule, opening at the same time on the hour can be an example.

All these activities require frequent and regular access to the waterways.  Restrictions at the railroad bridge will severely hamper my operations and income.  Furthermore, the new restrictions on the North Dixie Hwy draw bridge are already having a negative impact on boat traffic; it went from on-demand to once every 30 minutes.  The boat traffic gets very stacked up at this location, especially on weekends.  With the rolling current in this area and the large number of less experienced boaters waiting for passage, it is already a dangerous situation.

I understand the request to limit the operation of the R/R bridge to a one time opening per hour. The increase in railroad traffic over a single bridge that is over 50yrs old will most likely cause the chance of mechanical failure to increase. The Roosevelt drawbridge is over 50yrs old also. So a scheduled onetime opening per hour would reduce the wear and tear on the bridges. This is a positive idea for both the Railroad and FDOT. Problem solved.
I am a ""Polarity"" kind of person. Vehicle traffic has the option of using the high-rise Roosevelt Bridge along with Law Enforcement and Emergency Vehicles during this 15 minute window. The boating community does not have an option. I've observed as many as 25 vessels, yachts, sail and power boats waiting for passage through what I will call a ""Venturi"". All these vessels waiting around, burning fuel to hold position away from   each other and then who goes first. Is it by size or would sailboats have the right of way, but they are not under sail. Then there is your recreational boater that may think there is enough room to squeeze by a larger vessel. The returning boaters (tired,intoxicated,impatient) in the afternoon will probably be worse. These are problems I visualize going one way. This is an East-West passage. Now for the Railroad opinion. They have succeeded with Brightline System, even through all the lawsuits filed for different reasons. It's their property to do as they see fit to make revenue. I live 175yds across a lake from the R/R and have noticed the increase of train traffic, Brightline and Freight. As previously discussed with the boating issue,  will the Railroad side rail trains, blocking crossings, waiting during the 15 minutes? There is a lot of negative to consider and hopefully can be included so a decision can be made with both eyes open.",,,,,,,

I would hope that our local Stuart / Palm City public officials and State officials are aware of this and protect the public waterway access. The COAST GUARD should be concerned that blocking passage for huge numbers of boats for long periods of time is a major safety concern for boaters. I would vote no on the new proposal and leave things the way they are or require the rail companies to build a higher bridge like currently in Jupiter.
The vast majority of boats have sufficient clearance to go under the adjacent vehicle draw bridge when closed (only requires draw open for sailboats or large vessels generally over 40 ft) but the train bridge is way too low which blocks almost all boats when closed.   Closing the train bridge for 45 minutes each hour would be unacceptable causing dozens of boats to cluster in tight small space on either side of the bridge causing major safety concerns if they must wait excessive periods during rail bridge closures. This is a major safety concern because boats are forced to pile up close together and maintain safe distance from colliding with strong currents from the St. Lucie River and windy conditions.  Besides the fact that once the rail bridge opens then there would be no safe way to clear all those waiting boats in the short time they propose to keep rail open.
This low train bridge should stay open for majority of time (as currently controlled) to allow for safe passage of recreational boaters. This is a major access point for local and state tax payers.  It is unfair to reduce public freedom for access for the sake of the “private enterprise” high speed rail company.
If Brightline wants to increase access and train passage time, then they should invest their private funding to build a new/higher train bridge like they are doing in Jupiter to allow for the majority of recreational boats to pass through even when closed (i.e. over 10-12 ft clearance range.  This bridge seems to be World War II vintage anyway and is probably a structural safety concern or will be soon.  Its time for private companies to help improve State of Florida infrastructure if they want to profit.  Its not right for Florida State residents to suffer or pay for Brightline or other companies to profit.
In addition to safety and public access concerns, this proposed rail bridge scheduling will negatively impact property values drastically in the St. Lucie River and Palm City areas including and all marine related businesses in the area (marinas, restaurants, marine dealers). It is unacceptable to sacrifice public interests and welfare for the private enterprise railways.

We are avid boaters and fish the ocean almost weekly.  The only way to the main waterway is under the St Lucie railroad bridge.  
Railway traffic has impeded our ability to pass both out to the main waterways, and to pass back.  In fact, on more than one occasion we have been ""stuck"" on the other side of the railroad bridge for almost 2 hours on both occassions waiting for the bridge to open due to a malfunction.   During this time more than 50 boats on either side of the bridge had amassed waiting to pass.
During busy times on the water, the width of the railroad bridge, when open, is not wide enough for 2 larger boats.  Therefore requiring one way traffic.  
A 15 minute opening per hour would never be enough except, perhaps, at night when boat traffic is less.  Opening the bridge for 15 minutes each hour would mean many MANY boats passing thru at once.  Because of this, there will most certainly be accidents.  
Brightline had committed to upgrading the bridge, which is 100 years old and has malfunctioned many times.  Now they have reneged on this commitment and we are being asked to sacrifice the value of our properties being on the ""other side"" of the train bridge.  
The value of our property will most certainly go down because of this change.
We implore you not to put this in place.  At the very least, have the bridge open 30 minutes each our.  The congestion will be terrible and our property values will suffer immensely.

Many times the bridge will close inpeading boat traffic as long as one (1) hour or longer.  On a typical closure, traffic is delayed by 15-25 minutes from the moment the rail bridge starts to go down to the time is it completely up allowing for boat traffic.
At the very least train/rail traffic and boat traffic should have equal access on an hourly basis.
One of the main challenges while waiting on traffic is the tidal currents experienced in this area.  The currents are very strong and can take boats of course and unto pilings or bridge footings.  Having small boats wait with bigger boats is also a challenge because bigger boats don't have the maneuverability that small boats have.
A fifteen (15) minute hourly opening for boat traffic is insufficient.  Like I mentioned before, at the very least it should be 50/50 split between rail/boat traffic.
Highway bridge is only affected by rail bridge when the latter is closed for traffic.  Otherwise there is no reason to mirror openings.
The most important factor to consider here is that the rail bridge is almost one hundred (100) years old and the width of the passage under the rail bridge is narrow compared to the road bridge.  When there are boats on opposite traffic and different size vessels it becomes a very challenging situation for all captains.
A new bridge should be considered or a different train route further inland.",,,,,,,

When the bridge does open, all these boats will be trying to pass the narrow channel at the same time which will cause the water in the channel to become extremely turbulent.  Add a strong incoming out outgoing tide to that and you will have an absolute recipe for disaster.  At some point the bigger vessels will push the smaller ones around.  Now imagine trying to control a vessel through that area when all of the aforementioned circumstances come together, and they will, several times a day.  I hope the Coast Guard is planning on putting some boats in the area between the old Roosevelt bridge and the train bridge to pull people from the water after their boats are swamped with water or crushed by a larger one.

•Massive boat traffic jams will occur, causing a hazard to navigation, accidents and potential injury.

When railway traffic impedes our progress we are delayed between 5 to 25 minutes based on the the time of our arrival and length of the train.

In order to balance maritime traffic and railway traffic, the bridge should not be closed for more than 30 minutes in any 60 minute span.  In the alternative, the railway bridge could be heightened so that it allows for the same clearance as the SR 707 bridge allows.  This would allow a number of boats to navigate the area and not create additional, backed-up, maritime traffic while the railroad bridge is down.

Depending on the day and time, we have experienced an unsafe number of boats, in a small area, on the east side of the bridge waiting for it to open.  Due to the width of the channel under the bridge, navigating it becomes unsafe if large boats are passing through.  Due to the width of the channel and the types of boats that normally pass through after the bridge has been closed for an extended period, 15 minutes will not be sufficient to allow all maritime traffic to navigate the  area during weekends and high traffic hours.

Re: Drawbridge Operation Regulation; Okeechobee Waterway, Stuart, FL

Dear Sir,

As a 30 plus year resident of Martin County, boater and waterfront property owner, I have to strongly object to any proposal that gives the Brightline any priority over the rights of boaters.

As you are aware, U.S. Coast Guard Sector Miami Waterways Management Office conducted a Waterways Analysis and Management System (WAMS) review of the Intracoastal Waterway from miles 925-1005 in 2018. The WAMS included a focused review of the railroad bridges over the St Lucie River (OWW) and Loxahatchee River. The WAMS concluded that, with the addition of passenger rail service, the FEC Railroad Bridge over the OWW would create an unreasonable obstruction to navigation if operated under the current regulation, 33 CFR 117.317(c). U.S. Coast Guard Captain of the Port Miami, based on the WAMS, recommended the regulation for the railroad bridge be changed to allow for reasonable usage of competing modes of transportation and provide a predictable opening schedule.

The proposal that boaters would only have the bridge open for 15 minutes per hour is not reasonable.
(1) Do you currently transit through the FEC Railroad Bridge crossing the Okeechobee Waterway, mile 7.4, at Stuart, Florida? Yes, I live in Palm City and boat frequently.
(2) How often do you transit this waterway? Several times per month round trip.
(3) If railway traffic impedes your navigation of this area, how long are you normally delayed?
Short delays are 15 minutes they have been as long as 3 hours.
(4) How would you propose to regulate the balance of railway and maritime traffic in this area? Open to boat traffic at least 30 minute per hour plus the time to raise the bridge.
(5) What challenges have you experienced when transiting this area due to these bridges and/or railway activity? This is a very narrow area with fast moving currents. Lots of boat traffic and often smaller vessels do not allow clearance for larger vessels. Holding position in line is difficult due to the currents. Burning fuel trying to stay in position is also getting expensive.
(6) Is a 15 minute hourly opening schedule sufficient for marine traffic? If not, please explain why. No, the bridge should be in the up position for at least 30 minutes per hour. Anything that can be done to make the transit safer and easier is good!
(7) Should the SR 707 (Dixie Hwy) Bridge opening schedule mirror the operating schedule of the FEC Railroad Bridge? Yes

Forcing boats to loiter for 45 minutes in a strong tide area will create a safety hazard every hour on the hour.

The crush of idling boats will have a negative impact on the local environment as well as waste enormous amounts of fuel over time.

Homeowners on the west side of the bridge will suffer lowering home values as the full effect of this slow motion train wreck becomes apparent.

Businesses that depend on area boaters will suffer loses as impatient boaters take their restaurant, fuel and repair needs elsewhere.

A best case scenario would be for the commuter rail to publish a realistic schedule and stick to it, leaving the bridge open during off use period. At a minimum, the schedule should split time between boater and train interests. ",,,,,,,

And will create an unreasonable vehicular backup on the road.
With the existing schedule you can observe large congregations of boats waiting on the bridge. The currents are very strong and can take boats of course and unto pilings or bridge footings. Having small boats wait with bigger boats is also a challenge because bigger boats don't have the maneuverability that small boats have. Highway bridge is only affected by rail bridge when the latter is closed for traffic. Otherwise there is no reason to mirror openings.
The most important factor to consider here is that the rail bridge is almost one hundred (100) years old and the width of the passage under the rail bridge is narrow compared to the road bridge. When there are boats on opposite traffic and different size vessels it becomes a very challenging situation for all captains.
A new bridge should be considered or a different train route further inland.

Please do not implement this proposal. Brightline should fulfill it's promise to replace this aging bridge and not make the boating public suffer.

This isnt good at all. This will impact property values drastically in the South Fork and Palm City and all marine related businesses established on other side of bridge . No way should this be an option. You don't kill one industry to help another.

Just about every weekend to fish or enjoy the water and usually 1 day per week I travel by boat with my family to downtown Stuart to support local restaurants.

3) When I do get caught by the train bridge, I am usually delayed by 20 to 25 min. Often times it has been longer as the bridge is very unreliable and maintenance crews had to be sent out to open the bridge.

4) I would propose regulating traffic by a) limiting the daily train limit that is allowed to traverse the bridge unless a new bridge with more clearance is built b) always give precedent to waterborne vessels over land bound, as is the case by many federal laws c) ensure bridge is only down for a minute or so prior to train arrival and raised within a minute of departure. If the current structure is unable to do this due to being 100 years old, the party intending to expand usage of this bridge should also pay to make the bridge capable of opening according to this schedule.

5) Challenges include holding position amongst 100 other boats in a narrow waterway. Then when the bridge opens, the narrow passage is very dangerous with boats coming both directions and strong currents in the area. Anytime the bridge is down for an extended period of time on the weekend, there are usually boats jammed in close proximity and strong current waiting for the bridge.

6) No 15 minutes is not acceptable. Often times it takes more than 15 minutes after a train passes for the bridge to open. Additionally during high marine traffic times, the bridge only being closed occasionally through out an entire day leads to 100s of boats being backed up. If the bridge was only open for 15 minutes and closed for 45 minutes of EVERY hour, you would be looking at potentially thousands of boats waiting on either side of the bridge. Then the 15 minute open period would not be long enough to clear all of that congestion through such a narrow passage. People could be forced to hold position for hours. This will definitely lead to more accidents in the area and not to mention the negative environmental impact of having hundreds of boats just sitting in the area running. The burden should not be placed on the public. The railroad companies should have to come up with solutions with MINIMAL impact to the public.

7) This bridge has much more clearance than the railroad bridge and only impacts a fraction of the boat traffic in the area. That being said, that is under the current  bridge operation schedule of the bridge only being down a couple times per day. Increasing the frequency of rail bridge closure will lead to large traffic congestion with almost 100% certainty that 1 of the boats waiting on the bridge will aslo require the old Roosevelt bridge to be put up as well in order to pass. This will obviously cause traffic jams backing up into downtown staurt making unsafe conditions for pedestrians in the area.

If you only give boaters select times during the day to have access under the bridge then you create dangerous situation with boat piling up to get under the bridge, boats trying to out run thunderstorms not to mention potential damage to the boat and bridge if people try to go under the bridge instead of waiting for the selected times.

As an owner operator of the passenger schooner Lily ( USCG certified, federally documented 42 passengers, official # 623900) 
   The train bridge default should be open and have scheduled closings as it is now. Otherwise we will have to relocate our business that has been running for 12 years in Stuart. 
  As a professional mariner who is experienced in transiting the Roosevelt bridges, I have great concern about the proposed bridge schedule. 
  The strong and changing tidal flow and right of way rules that results from this is already a problem at the bridge due to lack of knowledge and radio communication by the high volume of amateur boaters. Even now there can be up to 15 or 20 vessels on each side waiting for an opening. When the bridge finally opens it is a mad dash to get through with little regard for who gets priority. As a master captain I am required a FCC marine radio operator license but it does little good when the vast majority of boaters don’t have the radio on or have it on the wrong channel. Many have a difficult time holding station in the tidal flow and wind as the try to gain position to transit the bridge. If you add a deck barge or commercial tow vessel ( sea tow) this complicates things even more drastically. 
  I have seen the bridge malfunction dozens of times and this further reduces my confidence.  This leads me to believe that a bridge tender be available for vhf communications on the bridge. This being an important marine passage (Okeechobee waterway), and a high traffic area it is not an irrational request. 
  One of the problems with the way the regulation is structured is that those making the proposals and those making the decision have little or no experience in this unique interface between marine and locomotive traffic. A train goes one of two directions with little outside effect. A mariner on the other hand has many inputs into their movements. Mode of propulsion, wind and tidal flow, vessel type and operator etc.
  This bridge could make our business impossible to operate safely in many conceivable conditions and is already challenging as it is now. 
  My perspective is of a mariner who has transited the bridges as a commercial tow and passenger vessel operator as well as recreational. From a safety perspective the decision should side with marine traffic or at the very least be on demand for commercial vessels when a train crossing is not imminent. 
  If forced to relocate, the railroad could face marine business owners seeking damages witch would cost much more than an on-site bridge tender ever would.

We personally have been on the water stuck on this very old bridge for more than 4 hours on a holiday weekend due to the age and the lack of reliability of this very old bridge.

Simply have the company do what they promised and put in a new train bridge that has more clearance for boats and is using a modern mechanical that would not require such short durations for boats to pass.  If the water clearance was similar to old Roosevelt bridge this would deal with a large portion of the boat traffic allowing most boats to pass without an opening.  New higher faster and modern bridge is the only solution with the increased train traffic that is being considered.",,,,,,,

I regularly cross the FEC railroad bridge crossing the okeechobee waterway via boat
2. I cross the above crossing between 4 (four) and ten (10) times per week.
3. Railway traffic often leads to a 45minute to one hour delay
4. Navigable waterway traffic has and should have the right of way and use of the crossing should heavily favor marine traffic. The FEC bridge is far too low and if extra rail frequency is desired, the railway should be rebuilt higher to accommodate the majority of marine traffic to traverse with simultaneous rail traffic.
5. Due to the low nature of the bridge and lengthy delays in raising the bridge, large backups of marine traffic occur which is a dangerous safety issue with many vessels attempting to cross the narrow span. The bridge effectively severs the waterway when down due to the low height over water. Nearly 99% of local vessels are unable to transit the bridge when it is down. This obviously leads to lengthy personal delays as well as exposing boaters to potential severe weather and the above mentioned safety concerns of large volumes of boat traffic congregating and waiting for the bridge.
6. A 15 minute open window is grossly inadequate to accommodate marine traffic. As mentioned above, few vessels can traverse the crossing when the bridge is down. The proposed 15 minute opening schedule would effectively close the waterway for 75% of every day, year round. The crossing is a high volume crossing and would decimate marine activities as well as decimate waterfront home values due to being effectively cut off from the ocean. Local tax revenue will suffer leading to service shortages. However, the most profound effect would be the enormous safety hazard the crossing would become. The crossing can barely accommodate two way boat traffic as is due to narrowness, and high volumes of transiting traffic will lead to substantial risk of collision, personal injury, and property damage. The schedule will be directly responsible for artificially creating this hazard to navigation by creating a bottleneck. This hazard would not only exist when vessels can finally transit, but would also exist as large volumes of vessels are forced to wait for openings in close proximity to one another .
Furthermore, severe weather is a regular occurrence in the area and vessels will be unable to escape from approaching weather when forced to wait for openings. This further creates a sever hazard to mariners.
7. The SR707 (Dixie) bridge should not mirror the FEC bridge as the waterway cannot survive the negative impact of the one limited bridge opening, let alone two overly restrictive schedules.

High frequency of bridge closing and or limited time of opening can only be tolerated if the crossing is raised to accommodate the crossing of the majority of marine traffic with the bridge closed ( ie raised to a minimu of 15-20 feet clearance at high tide)

The proposed schedule will lead to collisions and personal injury of mariners. The proposed schedule is unsafe and the controlling agency will be directly responsible for creating a hazard to navigation and will be held liable for damages in court. ",,,,,,,

Docket USCG-2022-0222)

We currently transit through the FEC Railroad Bridge crossing the Okeechobee Waterway, mile 7.4, at Stuart, Florida.

We transit this waterway several times monthly.

The proposed railway traffic will impede our navigation of this area significantly.  Delays will be up to an hour with a significant amount of boat traffic attempting navigation through a very small opening.  

To regulate the balance of railway and maritime traffic in this area, the bridge height must be increased to a height comparable to the road traffic bridge to allow a significant number of boats through. 

The challenge created by forcing all boats, very large and small, through in a short amount of time will increase boating accidents and potential fatalities. Currently, this occurrence is limited due to minimal bridge closures.  The wakes thrown by large boats are dangerous when traffic is compacted.  
Home values will decrease due to difficulty associated with long delays and basic inaccessibility to the ocean.  Boaters attempting to avoid thunderstorms will also be delayed. 

For these reasons, a 15 minute hourly opening schedule is not sufficient for marine traffic.

The FEC Railroad Bridge opening schedule should mirror the current SR 707 (Dixie Hwy) Bridge. Not the opposite.  ",,,,,,,

In addition to being avid boaters on the St. Lucie River, my husband and I own Meridian Marina in Palm City, FL. As an impacted business owner and personal boater in this community, I have significant concerns about the proposed changes to the FEC Railroad Bridge in Stuart. On many occasions, I have witnessed firsthand the dangerous conditions that occur when the drawbridge is down for any length of time on a busy weekend or holiday, and a dozen or more boats are forced to pile up in a tight, congested area with a strong current. I have witnessed at least one collision and almost been hit personally by boaters doing their best to hold their position against a ripping current, winds, and heavy congestion.

I would like to commend the Coast Guard for taking the important step to develop a predictable schedule of openings and closings. This is undoubtedly an important first step toward making passage along this critical waterway as safe as possible for the tens of thousands of boaters who access it annually. I appreciate it is not an easy task the Coast Guard is faced with to create a fair, reasonable, and most importantly, safe schedule that balances the needs of competing modes of transportation. 

In doing so, I implore the Coast Guard to consider that the marine sector is and always has been the lifeblood of the Florida coast and its economy. Florida is the fastest growing state in the US. Every day, roughly 1,000 people relocate to Florida with “lifestyle” cited as the top reason. Recreational boating is a significant component of that lifestyle which draws people to this area and makes the local economy, businesses, and property values thrive. Beyond recreational boating, the St. Lucie River supports heavy marine commerce, including being the singular access point for thousands of commercial and recreational vessels traversing the Okeechobee Waterway, a vital artery connecting the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf Coast of the US since 1937.

Taking into consideration long-standing marine prevalence and precedence, economic, and life safety considerations, any schedule the Coast Guard develops should, at a minimum, provide for:

(1)	At least 45 minutes of marine access per every hour from 6:00 AM through 8:59 PM, 7 days per week. 
(2)	No more than 15 consecutive minutes of drawbridge closure between the hours of 6:00 AM and 8:59 PM, 7 days a week. 
(3)	No more than 30 consecutive minutes of drawbridge closure outside of those hours.
(4)	Extra priority for marine access should be given on Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays. 
(5)	The FEC Railroad bridge should be timed with the Dixie Highway bridge such that anytime the Dixie Highway bridge is up, the FEC Railroad Bridge must be up as well. However, given the significant difference in clearance heights allowing most boaters to pass under the Dixie Highway bridge, the FEC Railroad Bridge will require far more frequent and longer openings. 

In summary, the waterway was here first. It holds precedence and is far more important to the local economy than pass-through train traffic. Restricting marine access beyond the parameters outlined above will have serious economic, lifestyle, and life safety implications.

Right now, when the bridge is in the down position, the amount of boats that have to wait to go through the area take more than 15 minutes to clear through once the bridge goes up. Boater safety will be put at an increased risk, as boaters will not adhere to the no wake zone, so that they don’t get held up for 45 minutes.  Brightline should be forced to make the necessary upgrades to the train bridge, as they had proposed. The train bridge span is too old to withstand the increased demand of Brightline trains. ",,,,,,,

“Brightline, the high-speed rails service that runs between Miami and West Palm Beach, has been part of five fatal accidents since resuming operations in November after a 20-month suspension due to the pandemic.”
Brightline trains have been involved in five fatal accidents since restarting service
Jan 5, 2022 Updated Jan 6, 2022
Islander Media Group, Inc.

45 total since Brightline’s Inception. And that’s on only 70 miles of track from Miami to West Palm Beach. What’s going to happen when another 100 miles of track is used at high speeds in down town cities along the east coast of FL?
The FEC freight trains have caused fatalities also.
“In fact, there have been at least 76 deaths by Brightline passenger trains and Florida East Coast Railway freight trains on the Florida East Coast tracks, between Miami and Jacksonville, since 2015, according to an analysis of news stories, police reports and Federal Railroad Administration data by the USA TODAY Network-Florida.”

Now we’re going to add Marine Traffic to the mix! 
Brightline was going to use the existing tracks, they put down new ones. Brightline was going to build a new bridge in Stuart, now they’re going to use the old one lane bridge. What city are the parked trains going to sit while a train crosses the bottleneck bridge? How many crossings will be blocked? 
Just recently approximately 6/8/22 the RR bridge in Stuart was being worked on and it couldn’t go down. A train sat in downtown Stuart for hours blocking crossings for almost a mile.
Marine Traffic in Stuart is backed up on both sides of the RR Bridge when it is down. 
According to e-CFR33 CFR § 117.317(c) 
Florida East Coast Railroad Bridge, mile 7.4 at Stuart. The draw shall operate as follows:
(1) The bridge is not constantly tended.
(2) The draw is normally in the fully open position, displaying flashing green lights to indicate that vessels may pass.
(3) When a train approaches the bridge, the navigation lights go to flashing red and a horn sounds four blasts, pauses, and then repeats four blasts. After an eight minute delay, the draw lowers and locks, providing the scanning equipment reveal nothing under the draw. The draw remains down for a period of eight minutes or while the approach tracks circuit is occupied.
(4) After the train has cleared, the draw opens and the lights return to flashing green.

Currently, it takes about 15 minutes to cycle the bridge for just one train. While the bridge is down the Marine Traffic backs up on both sides. Once the bridge opens the traffic starts moving through. The smaller craft can pass each other in the bottleneck of the bridge pilings. Larger craft must pass one at a time. Eventually there will be Marine Accidents. 
All of this is going to happen WITHOUT any Benefit what so ever to the citizens / boaters / commercial enterprises of Martin County. Best part is: Brightline is not going to have a stop in Martin County for residents to use the train! 
Property values west of the bridge will be impacted, tax revenues associated with property values will be impacted, everything will be impacted and residents can’t use the train!
I pass under the Stuart Bridges a couple of times a day when I’m on the water. 
My solution is: (yes it’s costly and the naysayers will POO POO it) but it will work.
In West Palm Beach route the tracks to the west up to Lake O and around Lake O to Orlando.
Acquire a swath of land from Big Sugar, pay them a $/per person / ton for the use of the land. While you’re at it, run a spill way pipe / canal from Lake O south along the track to I 75, branch the pipe off to the west, making a “header” that has an outfall every mile west ward toward Naples. The water from Lake O can disperse into the Everglades at a trickle via each outfall. 
Remove the rails from existing locations in the cities north of West Palm Beach and turn the Rail Bed into Bike / Walking Trails.
https://www.railstotrails.org/

Benefits:
Train runs to Orlando.
Train does not run through cities. Fewer casualties
Bike / walking trails for residents to use safely. Gets the bicycles out of traffic.
Big Sugar gets compensated by the Brightline.
Water goes to the Everglades that need it.
Bad water no longer goes to Stuart, Jupiter and Ft Myers.
Water is cleaner.
Everyone benefits!
Thank you for your time!

This was apparently a lie, or misinformation at best. At a minimum, the bridge should be open as much as it is closed. Additionally it should be open and closed at the same time. Every hour. In other words it can’t be open from 8 to 830 then close from 8:30 to 9:30 only to be opened again at 9:30 to 10. 

One of the things I was told before moving to the neighborhood was that a new bridge with a 25 foot clearance was going to be installed, and the old bridge removed. Please don’t let Brightline force passenger and freight trains down our throats at the expense of boating.",,,,,,,

Love the water, love the sandbar, love fishing, inshore and offshore, and just our “slice of paradise”. The train bridge has always been there and for the most part it hasn’t been of any issue for the waterways.  However, with things changing and this “express train” coming through our town it does cause concern.  Why does the train bridge have to be down for 45min every hour?I’m sure the trains run on some type of schedule.  You can always plan ahead but for example let’s say we’d like to go fishing at 5am, but one of our buddies is running a few min late, now we have to sit, wait, and float for 45-60min just to go fishing. Now we would be an hour behind schedule simple due to the fact that the train bridge would only be open for a 15min window. (That friend ain’t going fishing next time) Also, why does the train have to come through Stuart? Why can’t it go out west and follow 710? There is a lot less pedestrian traffic and vehicles out west, and I’m sure it would be more useful out west rather than going up through the Indian River.  I know for a fact the passenger train in West Palm kills a pedestrian at least once a week, and it isn’t moving at 60mph either, not saying I know how fast the train will travel through Stuart, but it is something to consider.  I understand they don’t want to train bridge going up and down 1000 times a day because that would cause wear and tear on the gears and the functioning of the bridge, but to only open it every 45min and have the pathway available for 15min every hour just seems ridiculous.  Has anybody seen the amount of boats at the Stuart sandbar on a Saturday or Sunday?  If boaters are going to have to wait 45min for a 15min window, there will be more than 15min of boat traffic going east and west under that bridge. Smaller boats can go through multiple at a time but when larger boats need to go through, they need the room between the narrow passage the train bridge provides. With given only 15min, most people are idiots and won’t follow the “no wake zone” laws so there will most likely be more vessel collisions.  During the weekdays I can somewhat understand a 15min window due to the lack of vessel traffic, however, over the weekends a different train bridge “schedule” should be considered. ",,,,,,,

We would keep the current rules in place governing the Dixie Hwy bridge opening on the hour and half-hour and keeping the bridge open until all maritime traffic has passed.  The challenges we face in transiting this area are many.  The RR bridge with its’ 6’ clearance brings almost all maritime traffic to a halt when closed and when open forces traffic moving in opposite directions to complete for passage through a narrow opening.  Add to that the strong current in the area and the shallow water to one side of the bridge.  Tempers are tested and boaters jockey for position.  15 minutes hourly only compounds these existing problems as the crowd grows.  The RR bridge opening should mirror the schedule of the Dixie Hwy bridge, not the other way around, and allow for openings on the hour and half-hour and remain open until all waiting traffic has passed.",,,,,,,

Yes

(2) How often do you transit this waterway? -

Once or twice per week.

(3) If railway traffic impedes your navigation of this area, how long are you normally delayed?

15 - 20 minutes with outliers up to 45 minutes.

(4) How would you propose to regulate the balance of railway and maritime traffic in this area?

Study or poll the local waterway and see the distribution of boat heights. Cater to 3+ sigma of standard deviation.

(5) What challenges have you experienced when transiting this area due to these bridges and/or railway activity?

The railway bridge is too low to allow many of the smaller boats to pass. generally all have to wait if the bridge is down.

(6) Is a 15 minute hourly opening schedule sufficient for marine traffic? If not, please explain why.

No. There are many boats in this area and train traffic is more infrequent. Why not do the opposite of what you have proposed and keep the bridge down for 15 minutes and let boat traffic go through?

(7) Should the SR 707 (Dixie Hwy) Bridge opening schedule mirror the operating schedule of the FEC Railroad Bridge?""""

If raising the railway bridge is not an option, the railway bridge needs to be the same as the SR 707 schedule. Why would we not standardize this?",,,,,,,

That would permit many smaller vessels to transit without requiring a bridge opening .  The present six foot clearance is too low for anything other than a canoe or row

The very old existing train bridge is very slow to close and open meaning that the time to close and open is generally longer by far than the passage of trains. As it is it is an inconvenience but a compromise between public waterway use and Commercial commerce. Keeping the bridge closed for most of every hour is a danger to boaters who must transit goin out and returning. Boat traffic builds up on both sides of the bridge an ad the train bridge opening is very narrow at most two small boats can transit at a time. There are nasty currents and frequent severe wind events all summer causing navigation to be very difficult. This will no doubt lead to accidents on the water and make EMS or Coast Guard response impossible furring this extended closure. Much of the local economy is marine based and these closures will adversely affect homeowners and local businesses while seriously increasing marine safety issues! 

As the rail line had said they would replace the bridge many were less adverse but now it seems this was just a ploy to gain approval and no plans are in place to correct the problem. Until the bridge is raised to at least 20 feet above mean high tide it is not reasonable to shut off this waterway to thousands of people for the benefit of a commercial enterprise that offers no value to the mariners in the area, decreases safety and probably will reduce thousands of home values with no resultant reduction in taxation!",,,,,,,

1. Do you currently transit through the FEC railroad bridge and how often: Yes, approximately 6 to 8 times monthly all year

2. If railway traffic impedes your navigation of this area, how long are you normally delayed: 15-20 minutes currently. This occurs currently 20% of the time.

3. How would you propose to regulate the balance of railway and maritime traffic: As Brightline has previously acknowledged, this bridge needs to be replaced by a bridge with more clearance and also a wider channel for boater to navigate. Unfortunately, federal funding for a new bridge was not requested by our congressional district, but this decision was never put directly to voters. I certainly would have voted for a new bridge. A new bridge should be planned immediately. In the interim, the schedule cannot be safely increased to more rail use without an onsite tender able to monitor the boat traffic to prevent accidents. This bridge was not designed to be down as often as it is even now.

4. What challenges have I experienced: When the bridge is down, especially on the weekends, it creates a traffic jam. When it goes back up, the situation current is dangerous. The channel for boaters has a beam barely wide enough for 2 lane of boat with 10' beam or less. Boat with a greater than 10' beam need to go one at a time. The reason is the absolute width but also the angle of the channel under the bridge is is offset from the angle of the channel if the Okeechobee Waterway so one has to turn as they pass through the bridge. There is often a current and sometimes wind, and this makes passage of two boats dangerous even if they are small. When traffic backs up, there is no system to regulate traffic the channel is too small, there are many large boats trying to cross, and it becomes a dangerous situation.

5. Is a 15 minute hourly opening schedule sufficient: No. I am sure the USCG has done a traffic study of sorts and realize that most of the marine traffic on the Treasure coast in addition to every boat crossing Florida via the Okeechobee waterway needs to cross under this bridge. First, suddenly restricting the right of all these boater to access this waterway to 25% without any sort of referendum by the public is not democratic and an infringement of the rights of boaters without a clear beneficiary as the ridership of the train is in question. Second, there are times where leaving the bridge down for 45 minutes will lead to a backup that will not be cleared within 15 minutes and such congestion will lead to dangerous boating conditions.

6. Should the Dixie Highway bridge opening schedule mirror the rail bridge? It will have to if the rail bridge is down 45 minutes per hour, because it will take at least 15 minutes to clear the backup which at that point contain large vessel traffic requiring the road bridge to be open as well.

In summary, the Stuart rail bridge in its current design was built over 100 years ago. Talented engineers and thoughtful planners designed the bridge with an intent. That intention which led to its current design is far afield from even its current use. The bridge needs to be replaced regardless. However, an increase rail traffic without doing so impinges on the rights of boaters to use the waterway as they currently can count on, as many businesses in the area have countered on, and creates a dangerous situation by continuing to use a piece of equipment which was never intended for such a use. The rail use should not be increased whatsoever without a definitive plan and funding to replace the bridge and an onsite tender to monitor the dangerous situation that currently exists.",,,,,,,

Today, the bridge remains open for 20 plus minutes randomly at a time during the day and it currently is a big  inconvenience and problem

As such, I implore you to uphold the rights of boaters over the callous intentions of Brightline

To the above, schedule  the bridge openings once an hour, during the peak times of each day, for a fifteen minute window 

Moreover, legislate Brightline to build a new St Lucie bridge as a condition of operational readiness so small crafts ca pass under the bridge irrespective of their additional unteniable  train schedule

As for the train situation, a set schedule and 30+ minutes per hour opened, should be the bare minimum we should accept! And the weekends should be 45 mins opened per hour.

But seems our local officials caved and we’re stuck with a 100 year old rusty relic as our “traffic light” on the water. Absolute shame!
This bridge serves as a MAJOR thoroughfare for not only the 10’s of thousands of people that live on the west side of the bridge, but it’s the ONLY route to Lake Okeechobee and the west coast of Florida, for people on the East side of the bridge. Also, many of us seek shelter from hurricanes by taking our boats west through the locks, which adds an entirely new level of boat traffic during those events.

(1) Do you currently transit through the FEC Railroad Bridge crossing the Okeechobee Waterway, mile 7.4, at Stuart, Florida? Not currently, but did until 4 years ago when we sold our boat.
(2) How often do you transit this waterway? Several times a month for 15 years.
(3) If railway traffic impedes your navigation of this area, how long are you normally delayed? 20 min. to 1 hr. But, add Brightline and it will be a nightmare.
(4) How would you propose to regulate the balance of railway and maritime traffic in this area? Build a new, bigger, wider, higher bridge to allow more bigger boats to traverse in both directions. Not saying it has to be forty ft. high, but maybe 20 ft. that  would allow many smaller boats under without having to open and not jamming up to so much traffic.
(5) What challenges have you experienced when transiting this area due to these bridges and/or railway activity? Tidal currents can be very swift through the 2 bridges, add 15-20 knot wind and it can challenge even very experienced boaters, much weekend warriors with single engine boats. Under such conditions, I never wanted to get caught between the bridges, but would wait way back out of traffic and swift current.
(6) Is a 15 minute hourly opening schedule sufficient for marine traffic? If not, please explain why. No! Sometimes the bridge is down for quite awhile before the train shows up and afterword still down for awhile. Then with a build up of traffic, there can be a real battle  to get through.
(7) Should the SR 707 (Dixie Hwy) Bridge opening schedule mirror the operating schedule of the FEC Railroad Bridge? Depends on height of boats waiting to pass. Definity if both need to open for traffic. If in doubt, yes, raise them both.",,,,,,,

Comments have been requested on the following questions about the new regulations proposed for the Florida East Coast Railway Bascule Bridge over the St. Lucie River and Okeechobee Waterway.  The following are some of my comments.

(1) Do you currently transit through the FEC Railroad Bridge crossing the Okeechobee Waterway, mile 7.4, at Stuart, Florida?
Yes, we live about 1/2 -mile West of the Bridge on the St. Lucie River

(2) How often do you transit this waterway?
About 4-6 times per month

(3) If railway traffic impedes your navigation of this area, how long are you normally delayed?
Delays have been from 10 minutes to 1/2 hour, but normally in the range of 10 minutes

(4) How would you propose to regulate the balance of railway and maritime traffic in this area?
Matine traffic should have at least the same priority as the railway traffic.  Since the FEC RR has reneged on its commitment to improve and raise the bridge, the current 6 ft clearance does not permit any but skiffs or rowboats to transit in the down position.  This greatly impedes both private and commercial traffic using the federal waterway across Florida., Additionally, thousands of local boats depend on access through this bridge, along with long-distance voyagers. Boaters need a clear, fixed set of access times, with a wait of no longer than 15 minutes, and an opening of at least 15 minutes. These periods would cover the hours of 1 hour before dawn to 1 hour after sunset and the opening may be ""on demand"" during these opening periods.  During the night hours, the timing would be on the half-hour with a 30-minute closed period and a 30-minute open on demand period.  A 15-minute open per

(5) What challenges have you experienced when transiting this area due to these bridges and/or railway activity?
Our selection of our home site was partly based on its access to the waterways and the Atlantic Ocean.  We are now experiencing the possibility of a reduced value of our home if the access is significantly diminished.  We have experienced significant delays in returning home from voyages as well as on some occasions having to tie up at a marina to wait out an opening when severe weather was developing.

(6) Is a 15 minute hourly opening schedule sufficient for marine traffic? If not, please explain why.
No, this requires an unreasonable wait for vessels, and during heavy traffic periods may have a great impact on safety, as vessels collect in the relatively small channel areas while waiting for an opening.  This would likely become a real hazard to navigation and marine safety as vessels try to maneuver and hold position.


(7) Should the SR 707 (Dixie Hwy) Bridge opening schedule mirror the operating schedule of the FEC Railroad Bridge?
It could, since its 14-foot clearance is more than twice that of ht FEC Railroad Bridge, which would be the limiting factor for waterway access.  If there are times of greater access, the SR 707 Bridge should be available to open.

I live in a boating community on the west side of said railroad bridge. That being said if  the schedule proposal ever gies into effect it will.have severe safety, severe cost to the taxpayers in martin county. First safety, as the schedule now exists it lets boaters navigate safely though the small cooridor that is the stuart rail bridge. The bridge is lowered on a set schedule now that keeps boat traffic flowing safely. If the proposed new schedule of only opening the bridge for 15 per hour happens safety will become an issue. Imagine hundreds of boats trying to navigate the small bridge opening in a 15 minute window. Boat owners wiil be forced to do something very unsafe to navigate through the open bridge in a 15 minute period. People will die. No for the financial aspect. Now we must trailer our boats to ramps on the other side of the rail draw bridge.  The parks and ramps cant handle the traffic they get now in stuart.  So is the USCG, local government,  brightline going to fund new parking and ramps in stuart? What property are they going to use? Property on the water to build parking and ramps is non existant. No.uses.brightline as it is on the treasure coast and very few people will. This a horrible idea. Whom ever evven came up this entire scenario should be fired. Bott line you will.cut of a boat channel that has thousands of boats that run though it weekly. Palm city Port Saint Lucie  will lose ocean access due to a train that no one cares about. Please think before you act. 15 minutes per hour for boat traffic to transverse the bridge opening is a huge safety issue, and will place a great burden on parking and ramps east of the bridge.

The speed at which the bridge opens and closes, combined wih the duration of the closure ahead of an approaching train is a major safety issue. When considering Florida weather, all too often, I have been caught with the bridge down in severe weather. This has happened to me with children aboard. Taking that into consideration with the winds that typically accompany a storm, a narrlw area of passage and other factors, the risk to boaters will significantly increase. 

We must also consider that this area is a no wake zone. Should openings be limited, one can reasonable expect boaters to violate this mandate in order not to be forced to prolonged closures. 

A close look at the wooden area below the bridge will clearly show how often vessels make contact. Limited openings will force even more traffic through a bottle necked area. Once again imperiling boaters. Should an emergency response be needed by the Sheriff or other law enforcement or public safety, this proposed change could endanger lives. 

This proposal is being examined by an agency that should be focused on maritime safety and security. By far, a more reasonable approach is to allow the private company seeking change to pay for a modification to the bridge.

There have been times that I have watched the bridge come down and waited 30 minutes before the train arrived.  I believe it is unreasonable to allow the trains to have 45 minutes of every hour and allow the boaters a 15 minute window to pass through.  The increase in train traffic was not supposed to be a burden for the boaters to carry, in fact it was stated that the bridge would be rebuilt and raised to allow for the passage of boats.  I understand there has to be some common ground here, I would like to see at minimum an equal amount of time between the train and the boaters per hour.  That being said it shall include the time the bridge is lowered to when it is raised and passable by boaters.

3.  The train delays last approximately 30 minutes

5.  There is increased risk of boat collisions and inability to escape severe weather patterns due to the bridge being down 
6.  Bridge openings should occur through most of the hour as they are currently unless the bridge height can be raised to accommodate the average boat
7.  No the bridges should not mirror each other’s schedule 

Opening the bridge for a mere 15 minutes on the hour would be a disaster.  There would be an increase in boating accidents along with a negative impact on the marine wildlife.   Imagine 30 boats waiting to rush through a bottleneck in a small span of time.    I can’t believe marine wildlife won’t be injured.  It will also have a negative effect on local businesses in downtown Stuart  who rely heavily on boaters that use the dock.   Home values will plummet which will lead to a loss in tax revenue.

Our club consists of 162 active members.  A mission of our yacht cub is to educate and promote boating safety.  The proposal to open the RR only once an hour is counter to our mission of boating safety.  Despite our club's efforts and organizations like the Power Squadron, the majority of boaters don't understand the concept of ""burdened vessels"" passing through bridges.  More times than not it's a game of ""Chicken"".  The opening under the RR bridge is not wide enough for east and west boats to pass at the same time.  The build-up of commercial and recreational boats during the 45 minute wait period will result in chaos.  This proposal is dangerous for all types of boats and should be rejected.

To have the bridge closed 75% of the time is just unfair. We navigate these waters on a weekly basis. We enjoy going to restaurants and out to fish. There are so many times we just want to go grab dinner on the boat or take a cruise with our kids. My son(14) also has a boat. He has been to Chapmen school for boating and has his advance boaters license. We let him go fish got to downtown Stuart and get lunch with his brothers. I fear that if you allow this to happen not only will it hinder the times of crossing but also cause a serious congestion. Making it an unsafe area to navigate. The bridge is already very narrow and if you construct the time to only 15 minutes a hour it will only cause a back up of boats. I feel that it will be a dangerous area. Many boaters will race to catch an opening knowing if they miss it they’ll have to wait 45 min. It is not fair to the thousands of boaters that navigate these waters daily. I feel the business’s that are on the southeast side will also suffer. You have restaurants and boat dealers that use this area as well. We are lucky to have some of the best fishing and recreational areas in the country and for it to be hindered by a bridge schedule that does nothing for our area is unexceptible. There are so many reasons to not allow this to happen. The pros and cons are so far apart. I hope that we can come to a fair and safe decision. Safety is something I don’t hear much about when this is talked about. And it should be addressed. ",,,,,,,

A pass through window of only 15 minutes per hour should be viewed as a safety issue. Particularly on weekends as boat traffic increases. Already, when the road traffic bridge opens, it can cause a rush of vessels and a dangerous situation, as boats do not form orderly lines to cross through. The current is strong and some larger vessels cause for traffic to operate in one direction. 

As someone who lives west of the bridge, this would impact my enjoyment time on the water,. It also likely my home value. 

Flipping the window to 15 minutes for train traffic seems like the logical compromise, as a new bridge would be the ideal situation. ",,,,,,,

It does not make any difference how many times I go under, it matters when I want to and how does that affect my plans.  Yes, I may not get to Sand Island as quickly as I want to enjoy a fun day with my family, and it is a inconvenience, why should I have to endure this.  The real problem is not my inconvenience, it is my safety.  I understand you do not have a boat, and it my be harder for you to understand the problems having to keep a boat in one spot for a long time.  It is very difficult, you have to take in account the current, the wind, and your other boaters who you hope have had some boating experience, or boating education.  Here is the real problem, the weather starts to turn bad with clouds moving in, the wind picks up, and showers or thunderstorms are moving in.  I want to get home to my home port before the weather really get bad.  The bridge is closed and will not open for another 35 to 40.  Other boaters have the same idea as I have, and now you have a number of boats trying to hold their position while trying to avoid hitting someone.  Having been this position before when I live on Long Island NY it is not fun and very dangerous.  That's happen to me a few time. This will happen a lot here because late in the afternoon there is a build up of heat which causes afternoon storms, just about the time everyone is heading home.  If my boat got damaged because the Drawbridge was closed I would and my insurance did not cover the damage I would sue Brightline. Second thought way should my insurance company for my damage which they probably will however, in turn I will be paying more in the future because of my claim.  I am a member of the United States Power Squadron and have taught boating courses for over 40 years and the first thing we teach is to avoid situations which I described above.  When in a confined area try to maintain you proper space and keep a lookout to see what other boaters are doing. For 40 minutes this is very stressful for the Captain and especially the family on the boat who are watching this scary situation.  Thank you for all your help for maintain our waters.

Currently, when the bridge is closed for even 15 minutes, boat traffic backs up, boaters try to maintain their positions in strong currents and boaters, on both sides, race forward through the TOO NARROW passageway when the bridge finally opens.  It currently is a dangerous situation which will become exponentially worst if passage is limited to 15 minutes / hour.  This will put our families, friends and neighbors in unnecessary danger.  As we all know, FL weather can be extremely unpredictable.  What if families are stuck on the wrong side of the bridge waiting for their 15-minute window.  There will be absolute chaos when the bridge opens.  This also will be completely unnecessary if there isn't any train traffic during the time the bridge is down.   I don't understand why the train isn't move west or as promised, the bridge & surrounding tracks aren't updated to allow for adequate clearance.
Regarding some economic impacts:
We move to this area since we are avid boaters / fishermen.  Limiting boaters' access will make the area less desirable, particular for the thousands of homeowners west of the RR bridge.  This will negatively impact our home value (and also, the county's tax basis for some of these properties)
Limited access will negatively impact local business such as restaurants, retail shops, boat clubs and marinas as boaters may opt to put off traveling or using boat clubs and marinas west of the bridge. 
On an environmental note:  We enjoy the waterway numerous days a week and love watching the dolphins in the morning and late afternoons.  The backup of boat traffic on both sides of the bridge may negatively impact the marine life in these areas.

In my opinion, at a minimum, boaters must have at least as much opportunity to pass as trains.  Anything less is unacceptable.

As an experienced sailor/boater with 100,000 nm of experience at sea and upon the inland waters of multiple countries I can, without hesitation, tell you that the present situation at the St Lucie RR bridges is a most challenging boat handling experience.  When this bridge was designed and built in 1925 it could not have been more than minimally adequate.  Today with the large number of vessels, with the right of way, being forced to stand off at large distances for the safety of all, the bridge openings do not approach being adequate.  It is often difficult and sometimes impossible to determine, from those distances, who has the right of way through the narrow, one lane opening. Once the right of way is sorted it is no piece of cake negotiating the narrow passage with the tide running wind blowing.  Always there is the pressure to get through quickly.  The complexity of the adjacent, opening highway bridge and the narrow channel contribute to the danger.  Frequently damage happens.  
Consideration of reducing the opening time of the St Lucie RR bridge should be dismissed out of hand.  Rather, the amount of rail traffic on that bridge should be reduced to allow more opening time until a new bridge can be built. Said bridge should have spans large enough to allow two boats to pass.  This would be a good project for the President’s infrastructure initiative.  
To limit this bridge opening to 15 minutes once each hour is clearly a lubberly move.  I have not heard a single person near this estuary that will support that change.

I very much appreciate the terrific work the Coast Guard does and in fact have relatives who have proudly served in the Coast Guard.
I’m disgusted by the deleterious impact Brightline has on so many dug-in Floridians.

I live on the Loxahatchee river; we’ve been able to pass from our homes to the intercostal or the ocean for weeks. 

there are still a number of commercial fisherman who live in a Loxahatchee, parking their boats behind their homes but they return each evening. 
Once Brightline begin running over the Loxahatchee, that, combined with a (much) longer freight trains, Means that the commercial fisherman will have the float around in the very strong currents that surround the Brightline bridges, with all the other boat in traffic on the way out and returning from there day of commercial fishing. 

There will no doubt be a series of accidents.

- I believe the rail bridge and vehicle should be co ordinated to the greatest extent possible
- Given the volume of marine traffic, 15 minutes per hour in insufficient , particularly on busy days and  days with high winds. Large vessels west bound need to stay East of the high rise bridge until openings are well underway due to limited maneuvering room closer to rail bridge. This increases time needed to clear traffic. I suggest three (3) 10 minute opening coordinated with the vehicle bridge.
- Recent experience, on very windy day, strong tide flow and six large in bound vessels and 4 to 5 large out bound. Vessel operators we told by bridge operator , just as vessels started passage that rail bridge as alarming to close. Bridge tender could not advise if this was a 15 min, 5 min or immediate warning. Vessels operators hastened to make passage creating very dangerous conditions and nearly caused an accident in the narrow rail opening. 
- sufficient opening durations need to be structured to allow for above mentioned conditions and traffic volume. The waterway pre existed the Brightline enterprise. Brightline business plan 1) should have anticipated the néed to replace the bridge and 2) factored the rail schedule to accommodate the marine traffic needs in a safe and responsible manor.

I have used the access through the Stuart railroad bridge for over 30 years. The railroad bridge closing have caused delays of as much as 40 minutes for boat traffic. The railroad should schedules the train traffic at night or such that the maximum closure of the RR bridge is 15 minutes or less out of each hour. I attended several meetings on this topic where the Coast Guard essentially guaranteed that would be the case. The Dixie Highway drawbridge is opened on demand and shoul remain so.

I have encountered several delays of 25 minutes and up to an hour per train with this remotely-operated bridge closing far in advance of, and reopening long after, train crossings.  There is no routine coordination or communication between the adjacent Roosevelt/SR 707 bridge operator and the remote FEC bridge operator, to advise marine traffic when the FEC bridge may close or reopen.  While the 14Ft clearance height of the SR-707 bridge permits passage of many smaller vessels, the 6Ft clearance height of the FEC bridge does not and it effectively obstructs the waterway.  The limited maneuvering area, particularly to the east of the two bridges, and potentially strong currents can be challenging for less experienced boaters to safely hold position while waiting.
The addition of Brightline’s passenger and freight trains, together with more FEC freight trains, up to more than 8,000Ft in length, exacerbates the issue of maintaining a balance between the needs of maritime (commercial and recreational), railway and road traffic in this area.  Regulating a reasonable balance with the existing FEC bridge opening for 15 minutes each hour is not viable due to the quantity of marine traffic that will build up waiting for the FEC bridge to open, especially during weekends, holidays, busy periods of weekdays and at times of urgent boat movements due to approaching storms or other emergencies.  This will greatly exceed the capacity of the narrow channels under these bridges to clear the marine traffic in a 15 minute opening, or even a longer opening if larger vessels, which cannot safely pass in opposite directions, require transit.  At that point, the question of FEC bridge schedule predictability becomes moot, as vessels unable to transit within the scheduled opening time must now hold position for at least a further 45 minutes.  Also, to accommodate vessels requiring more than 14FT clearance height, the adjacent SR-707 bridge would need to mirror the FEC bridge opening, thereby creating substantial delays and lines of backed-up road traffic on SR 707 (Dixie Hwy).
Achieving a reasonable balance between these competing modes of transportation is unlikely to be accomplished with the existing FEC bridge, regardless of any predictable opening times, without consigning railway traffic to overnight hours, e.g. 00:00 – 05:00, when other traffic is at a minimum.  Whilst potentially viable for freight services, this would not be consistent with Brightline’s stipulated focus on passenger services.  To achieve such balance during daytime hours, the construction of a new railway bridge having a clearance height at least equal to and preferably greater than that of the SR 707 bridge, as previously proposed by Brightline, should be required.
Before publication, new regulations should demonstrate they are in the public interest.  This proposed change does not appropriately balance the public interest of Brightline’s passenger services – presently on the order of 100,000 passengers per month or 100 per train, against the public interest of 160,000 residents of Martin County, more than 16,000 residents and property owners of Stuart in particular, thousands of local boat owners/operators and innumerable businesses either directly or indirectly dependent upon sustainable marine and tourist industries.  Additionally, the Federal, State and Local Tax revenues generated from our navigable, maintained and accessible waterways, exceeding $71 Million annually [Ref.  F.I.N.D. Economic Analysis Update of the (Martin County) District Waterways, June 2019], would be placed at risk by this proposal.

Yes

(2) How often do you transit this waterway?

Weekly

(3) If railway traffic impedes your navigation of this area, how long are you normally delayed?

Currently the railroad bridge is nearly always open, however if this changes to open only 15 minutes per hour this would be very dangerous.    The current passage under this bridge is too narrow for 2 boats to cross at the same time.   Also, depending on wind and boat traffic, this area gets very choppy and trying to get all boats through in 15 minutes would be impossible and everyone would rush and this would make it dangerous for smaller boats (boats will speed through to rush under the bridge causing too much wake for smaller vessels).    Finally the tide and currents here are fast and all this boat traffic trying to rush through would be dangerous.    On weekends & holidays, it will end up taking 2 or 3 hours to cross under this bridge if its only open 15 minutes and that would destroy the boating community and many boaters will choose to relocate / move to another community or to the east side of the bridge (or simply dock their boat elsewhere).   Boating & yachting is incredibly important to Stuart's local economy and restricting access to boats trying to cross under this bridge would have a negative impact.   I know I would not keep my boat on the west side of the bridge if this new restriction was implemented and there are not enough marinas on the east side of the bridge so boaters would go elsewhere.

(4) How would you propose to regulate the balance of railway and maritime traffic in this area?

(5) What challenges have you experienced when transiting this area due to these bridges and/or railway activity?

Staff the bridge with an attendant to allow for it to open & close on demand consistent with the few minutes needed for the trains to pass.

(6) At what frequency and duration should the drawbridge openings occur in order to meet the needs of navigation?
At a minimum every 30 minutes until waiting boat traffic has cleared the bridge.

(7) Should the SR 707 (Dixie Hwy) Bridge opening schedule mirror the operating schedule of the FEC Railroad Bridge?

Yes of course, these two bridges should have identical schedules, it provides no value to open one while the other is closed.

The navigation through the triple bridges (Roosevelt, railroad, and drawbridge) with a following tide can sometimes be difficult. I can become hazardous when there is a backup of vessels on both sides of the bridge. I have found that most recreational boaters do not understand which vessel is considered (the burdened vessel) and actually believe that if they were at the bridge first on either side they have the right away. I am seriously concerned that the probability of collisions not only exists but will become a regular occurrence. The last time I was at the bridge it didn't open on schedule for some reason. I can not safely keep my boat in line inbound between the fixed bridge and the train bridge. I have to stay east of the Roosevelt bridge and with the tide at my stern. I have to point my boat east as well. Doing this means that regardless of tide flow, every center console with an antenna up and often jet ski's will take their place ahead of me in line. Not a big problem with regular openings but during season it could take much more than 15 minutes to get through the bridges. I have personally witnessed a boat loosing control and getting severely damaged and people hurt hitting the fenders next to the train bridge. This is not just an inconvenience to boaters but also to street traffic. How many accidents would happen with people trying to beat the 20 minute opening and how many more would happen at the circles downtown. Even now the traffic blocks Allied Marine every time there is an opening. It scares me to think that so many people do not have the forethought to know that this is a very bad idea. This is horrible for the residents and business owners. History has told of a guy who wanted to put a railroad through farmers fields to make it easier to move pineapples. They just didn't mention it would not be there pineapples on the train running through their fields. Have we learned nothing? Jeff Sweeten",,,,,,,

However, I am frequently under the train bridge so I can visit friends, fish, have a meal at Sailor's Return, or purchase fuel at its marina. I have waited patiently for a freight train to pass in my 21' fishing boat with MANY other boaters when the train bridge is down. Sometimes these trains have as many as 200 cars, meaning the total time the bridge is down from start to finish is around 10 minutes or more. The number of boats waiting for the trestle to be raised during that time varies from 5 to 10 during the midweek and 25 or more during a busy weekend. 

This situation is even more precarious when the tide is moving in or out as boaters try to maintain their spot waiting in line. Just this weekend, with the tide moving swiftly and the wind blowing only ten mph, I witnessed a 40' trawler having difficulty managing his vessel in these conditions. His boat was being pushed into other vessels (tempers flared) as he was moving precariously close to the bridge structure and other boats as he attempted to maintain control. Imagine this same scenario happening 4-6 times PER HOUR on busy weekends. What is being proposed is CHAOTIC AND UNFAIR rules for the local tax-paying community. The Corps of Engineers and Brightline is asking for all the benefits while putting undue stress on the citizens of Stuart.

Secondly, with a train bridge schedule such as might be proposed, new drawbridge rules might IMPEDE TRAFFIC ON DIXIE HIGHWAY. This could occur because 20-30 boats may take the entire time the train bridge is down to get through the bridge, forcing the drawbridge to be in the up position for 15-20 minutes to accommodate all the backed-up boat traffic. This condition would create another problem with traffic going into and out of Stuart AND force even more traffic onto Federal Highway (Route 1), which would again negatively impact the local citizens AND TOURISTS.

A third negative impact is Citizens who live west of the bridge could see their WATERFRONT PROPERTY VALUES PLUMMET because of these heinous restrictions. People purchased property on the water to enjoy the recreational benefits it provides, not to have a corporation and the Corps of Engineers tell it how and when they can recreate it.

We live in America. As citizens, we should have the freedom to move freely, whether on the land or the sea. One small company (Brighline) should not own the priority and freedom over thousands of local, tax-paying citizens. These citizens pay for the privilege to live and use the recreational benefits of the St. Lucie River.

What is being proposed is the tail (Brightline) wagging the dog, not the dog (local citizens) wagging the tail. I believe Brightline and Florida East Coast Railway should have access. However, their combined use should not supersede the rights and privileges of the citizens of Martin and St. Lucie Counties.",,,,,,,

The back up in boat traffic under the proposed regulation would create a tremendous hardship for me and all boaters and is unnecessary.  Rather than keeping the trestle down except for a brief period every hour, the burden should be transferred from the boater to Bright Line.  I would recommend keeping the trestle open at all times with the railroad responsible for closing it briefly due to train traffic.  Further the railroad should post scheduled closing times on a web site and be required to update this information in real time to assist boat traffic with passage and scheduling.  From a fairness point of view, Bright Line created this issue and they alone should shoulder most of the burden it will place on recreational boaters and commercial vessels transiting across the state in the St. Lucie Canal.

I think the newly proposed bridge schedule will be a significant safety concern because it will require even more boats to pass through the narrow train bridge channel in an even shorter amount of time.

In addition to the safety concerns, I think the newly proposed bridge schedule will have a negative impact on the community at large. Fishing/boating tourism is an integral part of the economic landscape in this community.  Further restricting access to the waterways is not only bad for leisurely boaters- it’s bad for business owners who rely on waterway access for their livelihoods.

It is basically a one lane stretch under the current rail bridge with hundreds upon hundreds of boats using it as a regular part of life in Martin County. Storms are also a normal part of life in Martin County. I could not image the danger of having the waterway unusable due to the rail being down and having numerous boats unable to return to safety and being stuck in this situation. The Coast job is here to protect our waterways and those of us who use them. This would create a huge safety issue for our community. 

Economic- While I am not an expert on this I see no positive economic value to Martin County as Brightline will not have a station here. We will merely be absorbing fast moving trains racing thru our community without the ability to stop. The economic downside is huge however. The loss of property values on both side of the rail with drastically restricted ability to boat safely throughout the area. Restaurants and businesses on both side of the rail bridge losing financially as boaters and residents will now lose access to easy travel to support our local businesses.  

I cant imagine our local leaders would allow this system to move thru our community without a new bridge being put in place first. I cant imagine the coast guard putting our waterways and those who use them at risk for a high speed train. 

Solution- Route Brightline thru the west track system. It will be safer for our boaters, our pedestrians and will alleviate the access problem for our boaters and they can run their trains whenever they want.   

I welcome any opportunity to share my opinions, my vote, and my resources to ensure this rail does not impact our community in the ways listed above ",,,,,,,

The law of the land has always been that maritime traffic has had free access to come and go along the waterways with trains and motor vehicles having more restricted movement.  It will be a true tragedy should boaters now need to wait for commuter trains, when this is not necessary. 

As a long-time boater, fisherman, and SCUBA diver, I have used the waterways of New Jersey for decades. I recently moved to Florida anticipating doing the same.  While in New Jersey, I passed through the NJ Transit bridge at the head of the Intercoastal Waterway for many years. The railway bridge was always in the open position until a train was due to pass over the bridge.  When one considers the North Jersey Coast Line services Newark, NJ and Manhattan, NY there is considerable commuter traffic.

Please do not make a terrible mistake by catering to the railroad traffic and ignoring the maritime traffic.  It is much easier to close an open a bridge than trying to hold a position in the water for long minutes to hours.  What will happen to the boaters should the weather turn foul and boaters not be able to return to the sanctuary of their docks.

I believe you cannot find one treasure coast resident who supports brightline transiting through our community. Yet, here they come without any concern for our community. When there are tracks to the west, why do they want to transit right through the heart of our community? Money. Plain and simple. The profit of a few superseding the safety and inconvenience of the many.  It seems to be a common theme these days and brightline is a prime example.
If you look at the proposed train schedule (18 brightline/day plus freight trains), the speed of the trains and “speed of the train bridge opening and closing” it it may seem that the 45min closure is required to accommodate all of that but there must be another solution. Also the opening and closing takes about 4 mins each restricting the “15 min opening” to about 7mins of fully open?   That window of open is not nearly enough to accommodate the marine traffic that transits the location. Even a full 15 mins of fully open will be insufficient.  A very dangerous situation is going to be created with impatient boaters all trying to transit before the bridge goes down. That is not the only detrimental effect however, property values west of the bridge will decline and businesses west of the bridge will be adversely affected.  
I’m skeptical about these comments. However, we hope they are not just a formality and we hope the people’s voice is heard by the coast guard. Please do the right thing for the residents of the treasure coast. Do the safe thing. Keep the train bridge open. Lower it for trains. If that isn’t acceptable to brightline they should live up to their word and rebuild the bridge.

The proposal to limit the time boats have to go under the railroad bridge at the Roosevelt Bridge is restrictive and will likely cause a reduction of boating, reduced property values and a danger of overcrowding access once the bridge is raised. The homes, businesses and boaters west of the bridge will have reduced access to the waterway and will find restrictive use of the river. This will effect homeowners and businesses west of the bridge including Port St Lucie, Stuart, and Palm City and will restrict traffic using the Okeechobee Waterway to cross Florida on the water.

I have lived in the area and have many times used this waterway and passed under the railroad bridge as well as the A1A bridge and the Roosevelt Bridge. The height restriction under the railroad bridge when the bridge is down would make nearly all boats unable to pass under the bridge with the exception of boats under 18'. Even smaller T-top and center console boats would be unable to pass.

Florida and boating go hand in hand. Boaters and boating should have priority over newly added high speed train traffic and should not have their access to water denied.

Many boaters that I have observed do not know the rules about who has right of way in these situations, along with a lot of other rules. Not to mention that going through the railroad bridge can cause piloting stress even with one boat at a time when the current is running fast. I can only imagine that a hot head who did not make in on the opening that he wanted to make, he will definitely make the next one no matter what. I see boats running into each other, the bridge coming down on a boat and guns being pulled. The people in the smaller boats will cut in front of the larger and slower boats and bad things will start to happen. That happens now. Park yourself on a Sunday afternoon and time how long it takes for one large boat going east and one going west and then ask the question, ""Is 15 minutes enough?"" This does not account for the cars that are waiting 15 minutes. The boater will have to wait another 45 minutes for another opening and I am sure that boater will do everything to be at the front of the line, whether he has right a way or not. 
When does the 15 minutes start? When the horn sounds, when the bridge is fully up or when the bridge starts moving?  ",,,,,,,

Not to mention the thousands of recreational boaters living west of the drawbridge. Why did not anyone get alerted to this problem earlier? Why is there not being built another line of tracks away from the center of our beautiful cities for regular trains and the existing tracks are being reserved for passenger rail service? This appears to be a lack of planning and not taking into consideration the people that live in our cities. 
There should be traffic studies for the amount of boats passing through the area on a daily basis, which then would define the time the bridge needs to be open and how much time is available for trains. Then there needs to be a traffic study for rail traffic, which then defines a split in between time for bridge open and bridge closed. An alleged split 15/45 per hour in favor of the rail doesn't appear to be a realistic split based on traffic requirements for boating, but rather a one-sided decision in favor of railcar industry. Not to mention the safety concerns for boating while the bridge is closed and numerous boats congesting on both sides of the bridge. The situation in between the Roosevelt bridge and the SR707 bridge will be dangerous with disaster awaiting to strike. 

Responses to the Information Requested:
(1) Do you currently transit through the FEC Railroad Bridge crossing the Okeechobee Waterway, mile 7.4, at Stuart, Florida?
Frequently, but I was a regular boater crossing the bridge several times a week back and forth a few years ago.
(2) How often do you transit this waterway?
Frequently
(3) If railway traffic impedes your navigation of this area, how long are you normally delayed?
15-20 minutes
(4) How would you propose to regulate the balance of railway and maritime traffic in this area?
Flexible schedule, equal weight to boating and railcars. More boating traffic during the weekends and holidays require the bridge being open longer than it is closed. Consider nighttime/daytime traffic flow of boating vs. railway use. Generally, restrict nighttime use of railway to a degree that people in the vicinity still can find rest. I used to live in Harborage Yacht Club before and it was absolutely brutal. The buildings were vibrating when heavy sand/gravel trains were rolling through, beside the honking noise, which is a general concern for 2 tracks going through our cities.
(5) What challenges have you experienced when transiting this area due to these bridges and/or railway activity?
Boat congestion within the area is a serious problem for years already when the railway drawbridge is closed. That's with current schedule and single tracks. I dont want to even imagine what is going to be happening on a daily basis with 2 tracks and an alleged 15/45 schedule. I didn't find that the SR-707 drawbridge is that much of a concern. 
(6) At what frequency and duration should the drawbridge openings occur in order to meet the needs of navigation?
Why is this even a question to the public? There should be traffic studies governing and defining the operation of the drawbridge. In my experience, a 15/45 schedule appears to be setup for disaster.
(7) Should the SR 707 (Dixie Hwy) Bridge opening schedule mirror the operating schedule of the FEC Railroad Bridge?
No, but this might become a question and requirement of safe operations and avoiding boats congesting within the bridges. If SR-707 bridge matches the railroad bridge then this will lead to even longer clearing times for all the boats waiting east and west of the drawbridges. Railroad interests should not govern the interest of thousands of people living west of the bridges in a growing community and railroad interests should not impact the value of living and the value of the properties of these thousands of people and all of the communities affected.

In my opinion, based on my education in civil engineering, the second line of tracks should not be allowed to open until there is a functional solution for the railroad drawbridge.",,,,,,,

(1)	Do you currently transit through the FEC Railroad Bridge crossing the Okeechobee Waterway, mile 7.4, at Stuart, Florida?
Yes
(2)	How often do you transit this waterway?
Several times a month. Plus in hurricane season I have a contact for hauling and storage above the first lock in the Okeechobee waterway.  When there is a named storm the traffic under the bridge can be enormous as boats make their way to safer harbors up river.
(3)	If railway traffic impedes your navigation of this area, how long are you normally delayed?
Today, I am rarely delayed as the bridge is usually up, but when I am delayed, it’s about 15 minutes.
(4)	How would you propose to regulate the balance of railway and maritime traffic in this area?
That rail bridge is not designed to easily support both more heavy/consistent rail use and maritime traffic. Unlike the old roadway (SR 707) drawbridge which has 10’ to 14’ of clearance that boats up to 35/40 feet can traverse while the bridge is in the down position, when the rail bridge is down, little traffic can get under. Furthermore, the old roadway bridge has a tender than will raise the bridge on-demand, is this feasible for the railway bridge?  
In addition, there is a strong current under the bridges.   Boats that queue up have little room to be able to maneuver to avoid potential accidents and even the best skippers can sometimes misjudge the current and other factors when there are large numbers of boats waiting to pass under the bridges.  More frequent and longer closures will exponentially compound the problems.
Status quo for quantity of time for rail openings, coupled with a published schedule to accommodate new rail schedule, or a new rail drawbridge seems in order.
Any extension of the time the rail bridge is open is tantamount to blocking access to the river and would create an untenable situation.  Within 3-5 days when a named storm is approaching it could be catastrophic.
(5)	What challenges have you experienced when transiting this area due to these bridges and/or railway activity?
Safety is a big concern.  Strong currents are common in that area.  Boats have little room to be able to avoid potential accidents. Even the best skippers can sometimes misjudge the current and other factors when there are large numbers of boats waiting to pass under the bridges.  Add to that human nature and impatience and it’s an accident waiting to happen.
During periods of named storms the traffic heading upriver can get intense.
(6)	At what frequency and duration should the drawbridge openings occur in order to meet the needs of navigation?
The current amount of time the bridge is open works for my use of the waterway.  However, it seems random on when it will be open.   There needs to be a published schedule to accommodate new, more consistent, rail traffic.  Perhaps similar to the locked in, time of day openings found on other bridges on the Intracoastal Waterway. If a boater is late, he has to wait.  If the train is late, it has to wait…
(7)	Should the SR 707 (Dixie Hwy) Bridge opening schedule mirror the operating schedule of the FEC Railroad Bridge?
This is a difficult comparison.
The SR 707 drawbridge has 10’ to 14’ of clearance that most boats up to 35/40 feet can traverse while the bridge is in the down position.   Boats can not traverse the channel when the rail bridge is down.
The SR 707 drawbridge has a tender, and the bridge is open on demand.  The rail bridge does not work this way. 
If you can raise the level of the rail bridge to have the same clearance as the SR 707 bridge, and place a bridge tender on it, then having the same schedule should work.

We have over the years had several derailments in the bends north of Stuart.  When the rail bridge is held down for longer period boats will be held in position and will be regulated for traffic which will be greater due to the short 15 minute period of open time. Note also that the tidal surges and coupled with high winds and surge of boaters is a recipe for safety.  So what will happen is someone will get hurt or killed in a marine accident in the sake to have a train that no one is going to ride. Subsequently the open time will have to coincide with the traffic on the road creating back up in both directions into downtown and the opposite going into downtown.  The north south corridor of US1 will be critical for travel and a episode of bridge failure like last years shut down could create life threatening issues to get people to the hospital that are north of the bridge.  So in there are life threatening safety issues and there is quality of life issues.  Brian Mast you need to push back on any policy that allows this farce of a train company to shut down our way of life.  The Miami Shipping should have never opened up for larger shipments it would have been better to move that all to Jacksonville where it is more centralized.  The problem with Brightline not having enough money to build a second bridge is just that Brightlines problem.  They need to fix that problem not have the tax payers of Martin pay with quality of life and safety.  Jupiter got a two lane bridge and all new rail system, why didn't we?  Perhaps we need to elect officials that will fight for its constituents- that is what we will make it about next, protect the people you serve. ",,,,,,,

I live on the St.lucie River directly west of the railway as you can see in the photo I attached. I am a Real Estate Broker and have been selling Real estate for 20 years in Martin and St. Lucie county. It is my professional opinion that the real estate of Palm City and Port St. Lucie will suffer if the 45 minute wait is implemented. More importantly, boating and offshore fishing has been a part of our lifestyle all these years. It is that lifestyle for the 16,000 registered boaters in Martin County, the 12,000 registered boaters in St.Lucie county, and the 3350 boaters that travel through the St. lucie locks each year.
I have witnessed boats, yachts, and commercial barges pile up waiting for the drawbridge to open. The heaviest traffic is when we have a tropical storm or hurricane approaching because the St. lucie River is the waterway available to get the boats to the west coast and out of harm’s way. I’ve also witnesses boaters waiting while severe thunderstorms are rapidly approaching. I can’t imagine a boater waiting for 45 minutes with the amount of lightning strikes we get. 
Lastly, Brightline received nearly $16 million from the federal government yet is a private company. It could have utilized some of those funds to create a different solution to their problem. Furthermore, Their business plan did not propose this 45 minute railway closure to the public or the decision makers for its original approval. In my opinion, they are a private company that has encountered a problem with their business plan. But, instead of fixing their problem by spending money and build a bridge to fit their needs, they’d rather infringe on the safety of boaters and make us fix their problem. Please decline their request of a 45 minute wait time.

Yes.  I live on a home located on the South Fork of the St Lucie River.   I travel through this crossing several times a week.   

(2) How often do you transit this waterway?

My boats are kept on the water and as most people on the water, we do not have the option to trailer the boats.  I travel this railway crossing several times a week.  

(3) If railway traffic impedes your navigation of this area, how long are you normally delayed?

Under the current operating schedule of only freight trains, when I do get caught by the bridge being down, I’ve been stuck for upwards of an hour.   You have to deal with dozens upon dozens of boats that stack up on both sides.   The crossing is too narrow to allow boat traffic to pass in both directions at the same time.  Even with the current bridge closing schedule it becomes very congested.  Limiting the bridge to only 15 minute openings an hour will have catastrophic results (boat collisions, injury, and deaths) 

(4) How would you propose to regulate the balance of railway and maritime traffic in this area?  

The waterway traffic should have the right of way for recreational boaters, commercial boaters and  emergency responders who need to traverse this rail crossing.  I propose you keep the train bridge in the up position for a minimum of 40 to 45 minutes and close it for 15 to 20 minutes to allow trains to pass.  The trains can stagger their schedules to pass during these 15 to 20 minute closings.  This will still cause a large back up of boats stacking up on both sides, but without raising the height of bridge to a height where most normal sized boats can fit under it in the closed position, it is the only reasonable proposed amount of time to work for everyone. ( Brightline is a for profit private organization and they should be responsible for the reconstruction of this rail bridge if they want to traverse it for their own profits)  

(5) What challenges have you experienced when transiting this area due to these bridges and/or railway activity?

When the bridge is down, I’ve personally witness boats strike each other, I’ve witnessed impatient boaters try and get under the closed bridge and they didn’t have the clearance and have struck the bridge, I have also witnessed once the bridge goes up, the stacked up boat traffic gets into a rush to travel through the narrow passage and I’ve witnessed boats strike the wood pilings 

(6) At what frequency and duration should the drawbridge openings occur in order to meet the needs of navigation?

The only real viable solution is to replace the bridge and make it higher,  but a bandaid fix would be to have the bridge stay up for 45 minutes and close for 15 minutes for trains to pass.  

(7) Should the SR 707 (Dixie Hwy) Bridge opening schedule mirror the operating schedule of the FEC Railroad Bridge?

As it stands now, larger vessels wait 30 minutes between the roadway SR 707 bridge opening.  If they mirror each other, the traffic of both small and large boats trying to get through at the same time will be extremely dangerous. ",,,,,,,

Already, on a normal weekend the wait for a train can be 20+ boats. Looking at the volume of boats, and the increased numbers of marinas under construction, and the studies you have already run, I’m not even sure 15 minutes of opening will suffice. Thrown in another new rack storage unit between the bridges, and therefore right in the center of traffic waiting in line and you have a waterway catastrophe waiting to happen. This bridge should instead be built up a few feet to allow most hard top boats with a radar to pass through. This would greatly reduce waiting traffic.  We also have many barges and larger vessels crossing through the locks system to the west coast. Adding these to long lines invites accidents. Larger boats, such as a sport fish or boat with towers are much lower in number.  If that group had to wait, or boats making the crossings had to wait, they could plan for this. Raise the bridge!

This area usually has a fair amount of current and its narrow(even for smaller boats) so this conditions is very stressful and dangerous.

Furthermore, about 100 yards to the west of the tracks is a drawbridge that opens once every 1/2 hour. That bridge would be forced to open only once per hour if the tacks stay down for 45 minutes.

Why do you propose this rule this way?

We are not talking about one individual's interest against a multitude's,  we are talking about a multitude's interest competing against another multitude's interest so why not share the resource 50/50 instead?

Why not close the bridge 15 minutes, then open it for 15 minutes and so on?

Or why not 30 minutes open/30 minutes closed or any other combination of times but ensuring fairness and equity?

You have so many options but yet you chose the most frustrating/damaging for boaters. Are you really defending the right to access waterways?",,,,,,,

My concern about the railway bridge matching the roadway bridge is more small traffic on the waterway. Many smaller vessels are able to pass under the Roosevelt bridge, but not the railway bridge. Having the railway bridge match openings of the roadway bridge would create more congestion and higher numbers of vessels passing through a narrow waterway under time constraints. I believe this will cause captains to jockey their position in hope to make it through the opening. I predict more accidents, and disputes between captains. Many of which, I am willing to bet, will turn violent. With the chaos, my position must be to error in the side of caution. In doing so, I believe I am going to miss an opening or two while the ""qualified captains"" battle it out under the bridge. ",,,,,,,

There are thousands of homes west of the bridge that use boats regularly to get to the ocean.  The bridge being down will negatively impact the ability of the citizens to access the waters east of the bridge.  The current bridge is too low for most boats to go under, while closed.  A solution could be to build a new higher bridge, if Brightline wants the bridge down for the majority of the day.  

This new proposal would also decrease the values of the homes since ocean access will be severely limited.   A decrease in value would yield lower taxes and then could change the rating of Martin county schools, with less revenue, impacting the general public, as a whole.  

I believe Brightline could have a positive impact on the area with a new station close by but the proposal of leaving the drawbridge down would far outweigh any of those positives.  Brightline will not generate enough revenue to offset the lower tax income to Martin county.",,,,,,,

My name is Kevin Donovan and I live on the North Fork of St. Lucie River. I transit through the FEC railroad bridge crossing the OWW mile 7.4 at Stuart at least weekly. Due to an erratic train schedule, the bridge opens at unpredictable times and durations. At times I've been stuck there for nearly an hour! As train traffic has increased so has the number of closings per day. In my opinion, the specific amount of time per hour or per day that the bridge closes isn't as much of an issue as it's unpredictability. If closings were scheduled and posted for boaters, we could work around them. Personally, I feel the bridge should be up(open) at least 40mins per hour during daylight hours.",,,,,,,

Even during the brief periods when the drawbridge is down for a train, it creates traffic for boaters and quite a lot of backup in a very narrow waterway. Having the drawbridge down for longer periods would create an even greater backup in this small area, and could lead to accidents in this area because boats do not have limited space to wait for the drawbridge to open. There are thousands of waterfront homes that rely on this waterway. If Brightline wants to leave the bridge down for a majority of the day, this completely blocks access for these homes and boaters. There is no alternative route for boaters who want to get to the ocean. 

Not only would this create an issue for existing homeowners and decrease home values in the area, but this would sway new homeowners from buying houses in the area knowing they have limited ocean access. I moved to this area because I wanted to have access to the ocean to be able to enjoy my boat more often. One of the major draws of this area is the water access and boating lifestyle. With that blocked, it would cause people to look elsewhere for homes. 

Having a Brightline station nearby could be a positive draw for homeowners as long as the bridge was not left down and impeding with boat traffic. Perhaps if a higher bridge was built that would allow for Brightline to cross without negatively affecting boaters, or if the drawbridge had a schedule that allowed for boaters and Brightline to share the waterway.

1- Main issue is one old bridge for both northbound and southbound rail traffic.
2- That bridge has a reported 17 minute cycle time, real slow
3- Brightline traffic will make an impact soon
4- But far greater rail traffic will come as ocean freighters from Asia increase utilization of ports in Miami, Ft Lauderdale and Riviera Beach
5- FEC recently stated that it will not invest in a faster transit time solution
6- FEC suggests Martin County pay for two new, very-fast-cycling bridges
Solution: 
1- Coast Guard rules that neither Brightline nor any increase in rail freight traffic may occur, until
2- A modern, fast cycle, two bridge installation is in full operation, and
3- That boat traffic will have right of way for 15 minutes each hour, and
4- That boat traffic will be able to transit through the new rail bridge installation and under the Roosevelt Bridge in both directions simultaneously
Impact:
1- FEC will pay for the new two efficient bridges, and
2- FEC will pay for a two channel boat transit configuration, or
3- FEC will not be able to profit from any increased future rail traffic.

Our boat requires minimum 10'clearance for bridges.
(1)  We must go through the bridges to get to the ocean and the Atlantic ICW
(2)  We pass through the FEC RR bridge at least once per week.  Normally the RR bridge is OPEN unless a train is coming, then the RR bridge closes and remains closed approx. 20 minutes.
(3) So, our wait time is 20 minutes (only if a train is coming- and usually a train is NOT coming- so we have NO wait time. ) The 707 drawbridge usually has enough clearance for us to pass under without an opening.  Occasionally because of very high tides, we request an opening- the opening times are predictable and reasonable.
(4)  We believe the RR bridge should be on the same schedule as the 707 bridge- with NO further restrictions.
(5)  The challenges to safe operation through these bridges are:  The river current through the narrow passage between the bridges makes for a dicey time hovering and avoiding other boats as we wait for a bridge opening on the present schedule!  Closing the RR bridge for 45 minutes duration is unreasonable and a HAZARD to navigation.  Too many boats will pile up in a small area with a ripping current! The horizontal clearance is very narrow and rarely do 2 boats pass at the same time.
(6) 15 minutes is NOT sufficient for marine traffic to pass through the RR bridge- MORE IMPORTANTLY- the WAIT time of 45 minutes each hour is dangerous!.  The number of boats is increasing dramatically in the area.  There is a huge new marina planned for the area between the bridges and Dixie Hwy- hundreds of boats in transit will be using the bridges to take advantage of the restaurants and other attractions in the area- not to mention continuing up the Okeechobee Waterway en route to the west coast.  Traditionally and by law, water traffic has right-of-way over land traffic or rail traffic.  For SAFETY, a 15 minute bridge opening (AND a 45 minute wait time) is dangerous.  The role of the Federal Government is to provide safety to its citizens; NOT to accommodate a train schedule.",,,,,,,

While the proposed 15 minute opening is a major inconvenience and not fair to boaters and home owners who live here primarily for the access to the waterway, the most significant issue is the MAJOR impact to BOATER SAFETY – which presumably is the Coast Guard’s higher priority – hopefully over the profits of Brightline.  Boater’s safety is jeopardized when a large number of boats back up, fight the current and jockey for position to pass through an opening that only supports 1 boat at a time.  Busy weekends and storms further exacerbate the situation as boaters try to get home before dark or to the safety of their docks when unexpected storms pop up (as they regularly do here in Florida).  I have witnessed boaters race through the bridge NOW when the RR is coming down to avoid a 30 minute delay – creating an unsafe environment.

The solution is for Brightline to replace the hundred-year old bridge with a new higher bridge as they initially promised to do.  Failing that, the bridge should be open to boaters 45 minutes an hour as the waterway has the right of way over the RR and there is high probability there are many more mariners than Brightline riders – which is definitely the case for the residents of the communities in Palm City, Stuart and Port St Lucie that the RR bridge impacts.",,,,,,,

We chose to live here because of the waterways and it is extremely unfair to limit our access because of a commercial business that has no value to the residents of this community.  We have had to wait 20-30 minutes when the bridge is down and have witnessed several unsafe situations as boaters scramble to pass through the narrow opening when the bridge opens.  As advocates for safe boating, I hope the Coast Guard will prioritize boaters rights and SAFETY over the Brightline business model and require Brightline to either replace the bridge with a higher one or be restricted to closing the bridge for trains only 15 minutes per hour.",,,,,,,

I would also hope that Safety is the number one priority for the Coast Guard in making this decision.

Hello the Brightline’s suggested times of operation over the Stuart waterway sounds ridiculous!  Have you seen it on a holiday weekend when the train bridge is down ?  It’s dangerous to ask boaters to wait in a very very narrow bay, both very large yachts utilize this waterway as well as you every day commercial fisherman and families enjoying recreational time on the water, it is the only waterway in & out of the inlet for area residents.  You cannot restrict entry exit to 15 minutes an hour you will have lots of accidents under and near that bridge if so, too many boaters more of us that’s train riders come on! Please be fair to both sides however the time is split it must be fair to both! Thank you ",,,,,,,

It is even more unfortunate that our city leaders didn’t fight this with everything they had. If they did and I am wrong, please correct me.
Originally, Brightline promised the city of Stuart a train-depot, as well as an elevated-trestle so that the train traffic did not affect waterway traffic. Brightline has now reneged on both promises and is continuing their expansion at great cost to our community.
Residents of Stuart have now been advised, that because of Brightline's route expansion, that our train-trestle will be closed 45 minutes of every hour, leaving only 15 minutes for boat-passage through the only passage in our area. I expect it will be worse than that. There will be freight trains also, delays, trains waiting to switch tracks, more than one train at once etc. I’ve already sat through over 30 minutes of waiting for two back to back freight trains.
Our Okeechobee Waterway is a major navigable waterway that links the West and East Coast of Florida through Lake Okeechobee and is navigated by powerboats, sailboats, cruisers, commercial fisherman and barges. The trestle and waterway opening is already tedious, as it is a narrow passage only wide enough for one boat to pass at a time safely. 
With historical freight-train traffic only, the trestle is often in the down position for as long as 15 minutes as it descends well prior to the train's approach and takes some time to be raised as it is 100 years old and quite slow. If two trains are coming through, it will stay down for as long as 30 minutes in my personal experience.
As a waterfront homeowner with a boat at my residence, I transit this passage weekly and often have to wait 15-30 minutes for freight train traffic. I have witnessed weekend afternoons when 50+ boats are stacked up in massive flotilla waiting for the trestle to open. 
The currents are often very strong via tidal action and it is a serious challenge, bumping into and out of gear to jockey for position and try not to hit other boats. There are inevitably aggressive boaters who jockey for frontline positions to get through the trestle opening first and I have witnessed boats making impact, dangerous situations and hostility. 
I have also raced home with my family outrunning dangerous lightning storms that quickly developed, and think it would be incredibly dangerous to be stuck on a boat in a lightning and/or windstorm, with a potential lighting-rod, aluminum T-top, with no way to get to safety, simply because a private rail venture took precedence over the navigability of my town’s waterways.
I am QUITE CERTAIN that 45 minutes of closure with 15 minutes of opening, will cause backups of boats in the hundreds, especially on weekends. I am also QUITE CERTAIN (based upon personal experiences) that many boats will not be able to make the transit during a 15 minute window, and will have to wait another 45 minutes for another attempt, again, bumping into and out of gear, trying not to hit other boats or run aground in the shallows. If a barge were coming through, the barge itself is going to take at least 5 minutes alone for example.
There are numerous seaside/waterfront restaurants on both sides of this trestle as well as commercial fishing ventures and they will all be negatively impacted as well. Home values (like mine) on the West side of the trestle will be negatively impacted as well as our ocean-access will be hampered. 
Stuart is one of the last South Florida towns that is affordable enough that an average family like mine can afford to live on the water and enjoy the boating and seaside lifestyle, and I am so disheartened that the lifestyle I dreamed of is in danger due to a private railway venture. 
The US Coast Guard is taking comments from Stuart residents as they are the authority regulating the navigable waterway and the potential trestle schedule, and the hundreds upon hundreds of comments here, make it clear that our community is collectively against this proposal.
If we simply must pursue passenger rail service, even though I don’t believe there is a demand for it, it SHOULD NOT disadvantage communities it goes through, especially if it doesn’t service those communities. It is incredibly unfair to think about the impact that Brightline and this proposal will have on my town, my fellow citizen's lives, livelihoods, recreational opportunities, property values, businesses and safety. 
In all fairness to Brightline and boaters, the schedule should, at a bare minimum, allot a 50/50 equal share of the allotted open/closed time, with all train schedules, and it must be posted and adhered to.

First,my vessel is a 44 foot sailboat which is moored on the west side of the Roosevelt bridge. In the past I have had to wait for the railway bridge opening to proceed to the inlet. Since this type of vessel is not very maneuverable I have to stand off quite a distance to avoid other boat traffic. Given the short period of time proposed to get through and the slow speed of my vessel plus the increased, unsafe amount of traffic,15 minutes may not be enough time for all boats to make safe passage. This would mean waiting for another 45 minutes increasing the amount of traffic and the risk of accident.
     My second concern is that, given the amount of increased rail traffic proposed will impact auto traffic at the multiple street crossings in Stuart as well. To me this is a serious issue for any emergency vehicles attempting to answer life threatening calls. A more fair solution to these concerns would be for Brightline to detour their rail traffic to their western spur starting in Palm Beach in order to avoid impacting both boaters and residents. I would also like to know if our County and City commisioners have voiced their concerns regarding this proposal. I thank the Coast Guard for taking our comments and concerns.",,,,,,,

A 45 minute down per hour schedule for the railroad bridge will create multiple safety hazards and unduly inconvenience the public. If you look at a map of the area, you will notice that the North Fork and the South Fork of the St. Lucie River intersect at that bridge in what can only be described as a choking/funneling channel. The current through the bridge is extremely fast and dangerous to navigation, even when the bridges are up and the boats under power. As boats wait out the 45 minutes for the bridge to open, they will congregate--sailboats not under power and with big keels that make the boat hard to control in tight spaces in current, sport fishing boats and small boats. It will be just a matter of time before there are accidents. A large number of boats, in strong current trying to maneuver and hold in place in a confined area is not safe. 
At the same time, when all the boats are stacked up, if a thunderstorm comes through, all those boats will be exposed to the elements, including the wind, rain and lightning.
When the bridge does open, the Old Roosevelt Bridge drawbridge will also have to open to accommodate the boats. So the entire 1 minutes the railroad bridge is open, all traffic on the Old Roosevelt Bridge will be halted. 
All the boats will be in a rush to squeeze through the small channel afforded by the railroad bridge, which is just barely wide enough for two small boats to pass each other. The current rips through that passage, and controlling your boat is very difficult. There will be accidents. There will also be big boats rushing to get through before the bridge goes down, and those aggressive maneuvers will definitely cause problems. 
Now let look at that short time window when the bridge is up. If the traffic is bad and a lot of boats are waiting, some are likely not to be able to make it through the bridge in time and will have to wait through another 45 minutes cycle--that is, is the cycles are not stacked back to back making it a 90 minute wait. 
A more equitable solution is a consistent schedule of 15 minute openings on the hour and 30 minutes past. That will allow boats to not stack up or be stuck exposed to inclement weather, and enough time for all the boat traffic to get through.I urge you in the name of safety to  adopt a schedule that will allow the bridge to be down no more than 15 minutes at any given time.
Thank You for your Time and Efforts",,,,,,,

During this time over 80 boats were left idling on either side of the bridge waiting for it to open. With the tide running at about 6-7 knots this made for a dangerous situation. Once open all the boats queued up to pass through the narrow opening making a dangerous situation even worse. With boats transiting the narrow opening in both directions in the current there were numerous near collisions. All of the boats were under 36 ft. If there were larger vessels this could have resulted in serious problems. It took almost 25 minutes for all boats to transit the bridges. All this with a thunderstorm fast approaching.

YES

(2) How often do you transit this waterway?

3 TIMES A WEEK MINIMUM

(3) If railway traffic impedes your navigation of this area, how long are you normally delayed?

A MINIMUM OF 20-30 MINUTES EACH OPENING

(4) How would you propose to regulate the balance of railway and maritime traffic in this area?

LEAVE THE TRESTLE OPEN EXCEPT FOR A RR TRAIN TRAVERSING THE TRESTLE

DECREASE THE FREQUENCY OF TRAIN TRAFFIC

(5) What challenges have you experienced when transiting this area due to these bridges and/or railway activity?

WHEN THE TRESTLE IS DOWN AND FINALLY REOPENS, THE CURRENT, WIND AND BOAT TRAFFIC IS TREMENDOUS AND DANGEROUS.  TOO MANY BOATS WITH A SMALL PASSTHROUGH SOELLS DISASTER. 

(6) At what frequency and duration should the drawbridge openings occur in order to meet the needs of navigation?

THE TRAIN TRESTLE SHOULD REMAIN OPEN (NOT DOWN) FOR THE ENTIRE TIME UNTIL A TRAIN IS APPROACHING.  JUST THE WAY IT IS NOW!  ITS NOT THE TAXPAYERS PROBLEM IF THE TRESTLE IS ANCIENT AND PLAGUED WITH MAINTENANCE ISSUES. 

(7) Should the SR 707 (Dixie Hwy) Bridge opening schedule mirror the operating schedule of the FEC Railroad Bridge?

THE SCHEDULE THAT WE HAVE NOW IS BEARABLE.  IT ISNT AS IMPORTANT IF THE DIXIE HIGHWAY BRIDGE MIMICS THE TRAIN TRESTLE. THE TRESTLE IS SO LOW… THAT IS THE ISSUE!",,,,,,,

Thousands of resident mariners, both marine businesspeople and pleasure boaters, will be faced with an unjust burden and a real infringement on their right to travel. Thousands of tax paying citizens should not be inconvenienced by a train that historically has run mostly empty. 

Since it’s inception, Brightline has brought with it a number of inconveniences for residents and visitors throughout SE Florida. Brightline also has killed countless pedestrians and drivers in the short time it has been in operation. 

Brightline needs to work around the residents of the state in which it operates, not the other way around. 

A reliable train schedule must be in place, which also has the north and south bound trains crossing the bridge at the same time, to not further inconvenience resident boaters.

The bridge should be required to remain up at the top and bottom of each hour so that marine traffic has a sure time to cross. There also should be multiple other times within each hour that the bridge remains up. Boaters have the right to know when they have a sure time to cross. 

In addition to the severe and unjust inconvenience an hourly bridge opening of just 15 minutes will have on marine businesses and pleasure boaters, a down bridge negatively impacts emergency and governmental services including USCG, FWC and MCSO, as well as recovery and towing services. This puts boaters and residents at risk. ",,,,,,,

I have my sailboat in the mooring field just west of the bridge, so we transit the bridge almost every time we go for a day sail or for a longer trip. The request for comments asked how the opening of the railroad bridge affects me. Under the current schedule, it’s not that much, but with the proposed new schedule of only 15 minutes per hour, the wait times would increase dramatically.
 
One difficulty of a long wait for the bridge to open is keeping the boat stationary just outside the bridge fenders, especially if there is a current pushing the boat toward the bridge. It is also a waste of fuel to fight the current for the proposed longer times. 

Another concern about the railroad bridge is its age and obviously poor condition. I have heard that the bridge occasionally takes a long time to open or close. If the proposed schedule of 15 minutes per hour is adopted, I can imagine that 15 minutes reduced by a slow opening or closing, down to just a few minutes of actual time for dozens of boats to get through.

The property value of homes on the water (on both sides of the bridge) will be reduced if the railroad bridge becomes the bottleneck that the proposed schedule would render it. The waterways in my beloved home town are one of the big reasons we came here. Please don’t effectively shut them down.

When the high-speed rail service was first discussed a few years ago, there was considerable opposition to the idea, because this very outcome -- loss of access to our waterways – was predicted. I realize that the high-speed rail service is desirable, but trying to shoehorn all the new train traffic over that decrepit relic of a bridge is a bad idea. To effectively build a 21st century high-speed rail service, we should have built a 21st century bridge somewhere outside the charming little town of Stuart FL. 

The request for comments asks whether the Dixie Highway bridge and the railroad bridge should have synchronized schedules, and the answer is of course they must. Right now, the road bridge won’t open when the rail bridge is closed, because getting a boat trapped in that narrow, cramped space between the bridges would be extremely dangerous.

We have sat at the bridge up to 45 minutes with 50 or more boats waiting to get under the rail bridge. It has been dangerous at times to have so many boats sitting and waiting for the bridge to raise and controlled by someone in another state. I believe Brightline had promised to rebuild the tracks so as to not impede on the water access. If that is not the case, Brightline access to Stuart should be denied. We’ve invested in “our community” and it’s beyond insulting that we won’t have the privileges that investment provided before Brightline.

Both are necessary but it is unfair to allow one to dominate the other.  With tides and weather factors, to have the bridge blocking boat traffic makes the traversing the channel a safety issue.  In the case of summer storms, boats must find safe harbor quickly but to be forced to remain in open water caused by a closed bridge could lead to serious exposure to the elements.  

Many bridges in south Florida have specific schedule ""on the quarter hour"" openings.  For the federal government to allow the trains to dictate boat traffic makes the local boat owners like myself feel undervalued.  Fair and consistent schedules are necessary and needed.

Do you currently transit through the FEC Railroad Bridge crossing the Okeechobee Waterway, mile 7.4, at Stuart, Florida?  Yes
2.	How often do you transit this waterway?  3-5 times a week
3.	If railway traffic impedes your navigation of this area, how long are you normally delayed?  
A.	It varies, normally between 20-45 minutes, and often find rail bridge down on return trip, but on May 26 at 8am I waited for 1 ½ hours and was late for a scheduled appointment. 
B.	On May 26, the Railroad Bridge was down for approximately 1 hour and 30 minutes for 3 trains which delayed the 8am, 8:30am and 9am Dixie Hwy bridge openings.  The time between the second and third train was 35 minutes without an opening which seems unacceptable, since a 15 minute opening would have allowed the many smaller waiting boats passage and would provide sufficient time to close for the third train.  There was a large number of boats waiting to pass when the railroad bridge finally opened and my estimate of time to clear the boats was more than 20 minutes and this was early on a weekday.  On a busy weekend, 15-30 minutes wouldn’t be sufficient to allow passage of most of the transiting boats after a long close.  Boat traffic jams will lead to reckless behavior by some boaters and a dangerous hazard to boaters.
4.	How would you propose to regulate the balance of railway and maritime traffic in this area?  
A.	I would rebuild the bridge with a 18-24 ft height clearance and a wider 150+ ft passage. The original plan for a raised double track railroad bridge should be required regardless of cost.  
B.	Scheduled openings of the railroad bridge should be long enough and frequent enough to allow smaller boats to clear before and after the Dixie Hwy Bridge openings for larger vessels.
C.	Rail bridge closing times should be scheduled and times published, give or take 5-10 minutes, to allow boaters to plan approach times for passage.  This would be particularly helpful in planning passage if the rail bridge must be closed for longer durations at various times.

5.	What challenges have you experienced when transiting this area due to these bridges and/or railway activity?  
A.	Severe inconvenience to the Martin County resident boaters and guests trying to get to destinations in reasonable time.  
B.	Without scheduled closings/openings, unable to plan for efficient and timely passage.
C.	Unreasonable delays arriving to destinations late - adding an hour or two to the trip if you catch the rail down both ways, restricts boat usage and participation by non-boaters.
D.	Hazardous boat operation by racing or going to slow through narrow passage.  Boats racing have made hazardous wakes and boats going to slow when tidal current is running fast lose control of boats, particularly when transiting the very narrow passage.  
E.	Large wakes have splashed guests on board.  Also seen boats touch going slow or needing to reverse in traffic interrupting the parade of boats transiting the narrow of the bridge.
F.	Environmental pollution damage and increased operating costs.  Wasted fuel and related pollution caused by idling boaters from blocked passage for extended times is not environmentally healthy to the St Lucie River.  I also have seen boats anchored while waiting which damages the bottom and seagrass for manatees 

6.	At what frequency and duration should the drawbridge openings occur in order to meet the needs of navigation?  
A.	Rail bridge closings should not be longer than 30 minutes and openings should be a minimum of 20 minutes to allow waiting boats to safely pass. 
B.	Scheduled openings of the railroad bridge should be long enough and frequent enough to allow smaller boats to clear before and after the Dixie Hwy Bridge openings for larger vessels.  
C.	Avoid short duration bridge openings or long closings since it will cause hazardous conditions to boaters as many will rush to ensure passage through the narrow bridge opening.
D.	Rail bridge closing times should be scheduled and times published, give or take 5-10 minutes

7.	Should the SR 707 (Dixie Hwy) Bridge opening schedule mirror the operating schedule of the FEC Railroad Bridge? 
A.	No! Absolutely No!
B.	The Rail Bridge needs to be open longer and more frequently than the highway bridge. The majority (75-85%) of boats transiting the area can pass under the Dixie Hwy bridge and reduce congestion when the Dixie Hwy bridge is opened for the larger boats.  If the majority of boats are held back by the rail bridge, and can only transit when the Highway bridge is open, there will be substantial congestion and increased hazards trying to pass all the boats through the narrow rail bridge during the brief Hwy bridge openings.
C.	Boaters of Martin County should have the right of way over the water and get greater consideration than Brightline.  There are thousands of boats west of the bridge that need passage and extended closing times and arbitrary brief railroad openings should not be allowed.

Opening it for 45 minutes and keeping it closed for 15 minutes would be equitable as the boaters have the right of way and a private enterprises does not have the right to unreasonably restrict access. 
They should (and can) build a taller bridge or reroute the tracks.  
We are not an underdeveloped 3rd  world country. Yet this is what is being proposed.

On the current state road 707 drawbridge schedule I am delayed 1-3 times a week. When waiting for the bridge to open I experience other vessels waiting also. On the east side of the bridges, vessels lose room to maneuver against the current as more vessels approach. A large vessel can be the first to arrive, and then soon after, that vessel will be surrounded by many smaller vessels and the larger vessel then has less room to avoid collision. At times there will be 1 to 12 vessels on the east side and 1 to 6 vessels waiting on the west side. All vessels range from 18' to over 40' commonly. Note: There are many larger vessels that transit this waterway every day. Once the drawbridge opens, most of the waiting vessels start moving towards the bridge immediately. At this time the channel between both drawbridges become very congested and many times too dangerous to proceed. Wide vessels such as and not limited to catamarans are commonly using this waterway and meeting them in this area becomes too dangerous to navigate. When the channel is too dangerous to navigate, many vessels are forced to wait which prolongs the time needed for the drawbridges to be open. This causes many vessels to continue making way after the bridge tender sounds the alarm notifying vessels that the draw bridge is closing. This scenario becomes problematic for the bridge tenders. They are facing a possible collision with the bridge and vessels still making way under the bridge or approaching at a close distance. At the same time the tenders know there are approaching trains. I strongly feel bringing the schedule for openings less than the current schedule well cause more unsafe congestion. Shortening the openings schedule will cause accidents. Accidents in a small area with very strong current and many obstacles impeding any efforts for rescue by untrained bystanders. ",,,,,,,

Yes.

(2) How often do you transit this waterway?

Two to eight times per week.

(3) If railway traffic impedes your navigation of this area, how long are you normally delayed?


15 to 30 minutes.

(4) How would you propose to regulate the balance of railway and maritime traffic in this area?

Construct a new bridge to elevate above the waterway, or, at a minimum, allow equal access for boat and train traffic (10min down, 10min up, repeat).  There is no reason boat traffic should be impeded 75% of the time.

(5) What challenges have you experienced when transiting this area due to these bridges and/or railway activity?

The area surrounding the bridge is narrow and shallow, and there is a strong current through the area.  It is difficult to wait safely when other boats are present and also waiting.   

If 45 min of boat traffic is required to wait the situation will become dangerous.   Waiting in a boat is not like waiting in a car or train - the boat doesn't stop moving due to currents, wind, etc.  

(6) At what frequency and duration should the drawbridge openings occur in order to meet the needs of navigation?

The bridge should open every 10 minutes at a minimum, for at least 10 minutes, to allow boat traffic to safely clear.   An alternating 10min down, 10min up schedule would be reasonable to allow train and boat traffic equal access. 

(7) Should the SR 707 (Dixie Hwy) Bridge opening schedule mirror the operating schedule of the FEC Railroad Bridge?

It would have to, otherwise you risk having an unsafe number of boaters trapped between the two bridges trying to maintain safe distance from one another while waiting.   A 10min down, 10min up schedule could also be adopted for that bridge to allow car traffic equal access, with timing coinciding with the railway bridge. ",,,,,,,

sirs, it is my opinion that the best way to operate the RR bridge would be to open it whenever the old Roosevelt bridge opens for boat traffic.That should be every 20 minutes if boat traffic is waiting. If this Brightline gimic is truly about passengers that would leave plenty of time for them to get their small number of cars through. It would be a different story if they were using it for 2 mile long double decker frieght cars. but this is for the public good right?",,,,,,,

I have a 36' sport fish with a mini tower and 29' outriggers.  I cannot get under either bridge without having them open.
(2) I live in the county of port st lucie on a full time basis and have since 2013.  I transit the the waterway 4-5 times a week for various reasons weather dependant.
(3)  when rr traffic impedes navigation you could be waiting anywhere from 20 minutes to over an hour on one occassion.
(4) the boat traffic should take priority.  I'm sure the trains can operate on a schedule to lessen the burden on the boaters.  for freight trains they could use it at night as opposed to haphazardly during the day.  as far as passenger trains, they will never have enough riders to justify the number of trains they are talking about.   The current set up with the bridge and rr bridge was  to accommodate the boaters.  It was never meant to accommodate the volume of passengers and freight trains.  at a minimum the bridges should be up for 45 minutes every hour

(4) any kind of maintenance on either bridge should be done at nite when marine traffic is minimal not during the day and especially during a time that the highway bridge is scheduled to be open.

(5) when the rr bridge is down basically no boats can get through.  After it goes up the highway bridge usually goes up because they either missed an opening  or are due for the next opening.  The bigger boats have to wait for all the samller boats to get through before they can go thru because only 1 boat at a time can fit through the rr bridge.  At a minimum, they should make the opening span of the rr bridge larger so more than 1 boat can get through at a time.  They should replace the whole span across the water of the rr bridge and make it higher so more smaller boats could get through and avoid the accidents that are going to happen when the small boats are competing with the bigger boats 

(6) 15 minutes is noit long enough for marine traffic; reasons are mentioned above.  This all gets compounded when there are storms and bad weather.  Also if the rr does not want to work at nite why do they want to work on the weekends.  I would think pay would not be to different for them.

(7) they should both be open at the same time for 30-45 minutes each hour. When they are not you have boats that go between the rr bridge and sr707 bridge,.  they end up being caught there when rr bridge goes down and have to jockey with the current,.  for example the highway bridge is scheduled to open at 5 and the rr bridge goes down at 4:55.  boaters think that if they are in that area the sr707 bridge will open for them if they are going west bound

The biggest issue is that the sr707 bridge has no idea what the rr bridge is doing or when. And the boaters have no idea what the rr bridge is doing until it starts going down.  The rr bridge knows when the sr707 bridge is going to open, why would they come out at 5 minutes before the sr707 is scheduled to open with a truck on the tracks and close the rr bridge.  walk back and get in the truck and drive across the bridge get out walk back and put the bridge up. 20 minutes later the sr 707 bridge then opens for previous 1/2 hour opening or the current 20 minutes opening.  The rr should take a backseat and work around what's best for the boaters not vice versa ",,,,,,,

That being said my family and I understand growth and the infrastructure required to support said growth. We also understand that safety is paramount and that you cannot place a dollar amount over safety. 

However, since 2013, and before Brightline was really on the horizon, when passing beneath, we comment frequently on the poor condition of the railroad bridge in question. Even our 9 yr old can see that it is in poor repair. There are bare wires hanging and corrosion everywhere just to name a couple obvious eye sores. We have also been stuck on several occasions as the RR bridge has stuck in the open, closed, or somewhere in between while we were waiting or attempting to pass. This is an obvious safety issue and one the risk factor for an incident / accident is only going to increase as frequency of trains and speeds increase.


Aside from the obvious safety concerns of more and faster trains, even during the week, during times of relatively minimal boat traffic compared to weekends, holidays, or in season there can be 10 boats waiting on each side of
the bridge. When the bridge rises, it resembles a scene from the movie Braveheart with no one operating according to the rules of the road and most simply making way at the cost of safety. This is on lightly trafficked days. I cannot imagine the quagmire of boats that 30 min every 2 hrs would cause on a weekend or holiday. I cannot imagine that all boats waiting after 1.5 hrs would be cleared in 15 min. This will lead to many jockeying for position to be in a good place to make the opening. This is merely human nature but is again casting safety aside.

In closing, it seems that safety is taking a backseat to progress. Its a shame that it’s only after an accident that most can look back and say they should have done it differently. This is the USCG’s chance to be proactive and preserve safety over dollars. ",,,,,,,

(I currently  live on the East side of the FEC Bridge) Unfortunately I cannot always transit this area because I do not clear the RR bridge when lowered. I have a 20' dual console boat. There has been times when I have waited 45 minutes or more for the RR Bridge to open due to multiple freight trains or the operator failed to open it (I believe this issue has been resolved) I used to live on the west side of the bridge and this would jeopardize me operating during daytime hours often and I would arrive back to the dock later then planned. With a scheduled opening of only 15 minutes per hour, I cannot imagine the amount of marine traffic jams with boats waiting to transit this area. Boats will be heading both  East and West concurrently and the bridge is narrow, add in there larger sport fishers, trawlers, sailboats or 60'-100' yachts that all utilize this waterway and it is a recipe for disaster. Not only will this be a bottle neck but the river both east and west of the bridge will be a traffic jam. Picture 35 boats on the weekends all cruising together on the river heading to the sandbar. lets be realistic not all of the weekend warrior boaters know the rules of the road. this is one of the reasons I left Palm city to move on the East side of the RR Bridge. The bride should be raised to at least the height of the Dixie Hwy Draw Bridge. This will give the opportunity for pleasure boaters to transit safely without the unnecessary traffic jams. I did not even mention the commercial traffic transiting through this narrow passageway. I have witnessed barges under tow take as long as 10-15 minutes to navigate this short stretch of water. So now if the schedule ids 15 minutes per hour well now we just lost almost 2 hours due to one commercial vessel. What about safety? Martin County Marine Patrol, Towboat or Sea Tow, The Coast Guard. What happens in an emergency? Does the Emergency take priority over the bridge opening schedule. The amount of Marine traffic has been steadily increasing year over year and the only solution to prevent tragedy is to raise the height of the RR bridge. ",,,,,,,

To Whom it may concern: 

I am more than happy to send a letter of support for Brightline’s intercity passenger rail service which will connect South Florida to Central Florida. This is what many of us have been waiting for – a way to travel to Orlando that does NOT include getting in our cars. On Brightline, we can turn the 3-4 hour, stress-filled trip into an enjoyable and productive train journey. 

While this is a natural for supporting two powerhouse tourism meccas in Florida, it is also a much-needed option for the business community. As a tourist, using a clean, efficient rail system takes the worry out of traveling unfamiliar highways. Many of our out-of-state visitors are actually out-of-country, where rail travel is a regular mode of transportation. This service will help upgrade our profile as a welcoming state to both visitors and residents alike.

We strongly recommend that the United States Coast Guard put this critical transportation service at the top of their list so we can move forward with confidence and speed. We wholeheartedly support Brightline’s expansion plan towards growing the necessary infrastructure with which to support an ever-expanding population.

It is crazy to reduce the operating hours of the railroad bridge to the public.  If Brightline wants to run more trains then they can build their own bridge higher so it doesn't need to open or close.  From what I understand Brightline originally planned on building a bridge and now wants to save money and use the old bridge and hurt the public access.  This is a totally wrong approach and must be stopped.  The public has the right to water access and a private interprise should not/can not be allowed to reduce it.",,,,,,,

(1) Do you currently transit through the FEC Railroad Bridge crossing the Okeechobee Waterway, mile 7.4, at Stuart, Florida?   YES.

(2) How often do you transit this waterway?  At least once per week. I live and dock my boats in the Seagate Harbor neighborhood.

(3) If railway traffic impedes your navigation of this area, how long are you normally delayed?   Currently, the FEC bridge only closes when a train is crossing the river. Typically, I am delayed 10-15 minutes depending on the length train.

(4) How would you propose to regulate the balance of railway and maritime traffic in this area?   I propose a 50/50 split between the railroad and the boat traffic. 

(5) What challenges have you experienced when transiting this area due to these bridges and/or railway activity?   The Dixie Highway bridge will not open when the FEC railroad bridge is down or if it is preparing to go down. Depending on the time of day, this could delay larger boat traffic more than 30 minutes.

(6) Is a 15 minute hourly opening schedule sufficient for marine traffic? If not, please explain why.   NO – Absolutely Not. During high traffic times, especially Weekends & Holidays, there are usually several larger boats already waiting on the Dixie Highway bridge to open. If you add all the smaller boats that fit under the closed Dixie Highway bridge to the holding pattern waiting for the bridges to open, there will be MAYHEM. There will be constant collisions under the bridges as boaters race from opposite directions to get through the narrow opening. Only opening the bridges for 15 minutes per hour will require USCG and/or Martin County Sherriff deputies to be stationed on both sides of the bridges to mitigate the CHAOS and administer to all of the injured boaters.  
I can promise, there will be dozens of boat operators with varying degrees of skill and sobriety all attempting to transit he bridges at greater than idle speed from both directions every 60 minutes!  

(7) Should the SR 707 (Dixie Hwy) Bridge opening schedule mirror the operating schedule of the FEC Railroad Bridge?   YES.

I live one mile from the Shepard boat ramp in Stuart. I boat multiple times per week. I'm worried they're going to accidents due to the change regarding the train bridge. It's going to to be quite difficult to transit the both brides for only 15 minutes on a busy weekend. There's going to ""be a rush"" to beat the traffic which will lead to accidents. Also there won't be enough space for all the boat's waiting to transit especially between the Dixie and train bridge. Also the Dixie bridge will need to be up because of the boats that heading across the state. That will lead to traffic in the downtown area. Downtown area not the CG's problem but a problem none the leas. I will on weekends probably launch at a different ramp and know have to tow through downtown Stuart to do so. Brightline could have paid to fix this problem. They made a choice not to why should Stuart have to deal with the consequences?  The train bridge will at least need a law enforcement officer to help with traffic control!! 45 minutes of waiting will test anyone's patience. What should we have to deal with..

The timing is completely random and no information has been available as to the schedule or length of delay.  We have been floating with 20 + other boaters causing congestion which is very dangerous due to the 2 other bridges nearly, current, and schoals surrounding the bridge.  I would you propose to regulate the balance of railway and maritime traffic in this area by keeping the bridge up unless a scheduled train is coming though and posting the schedules of the bridge closures and train traffic on a website and signage at the bridge.  We use the canal to access the west coast and use the waterways to access restaurants and shops in Stuart via our boat.  Hourly closures could be tolerated if they are scheduled and 15 - 20 minutes in duration.  Scheduling makes better sense with the nearby bridge to accommodate larger boats and sailing vessels.",,,,,,,

(1) Do you currently transit through the FEC Railroad Bridge crossing the Okeechobee Waterway, mile 7.4, at Stuart, Florida? 
Yes, on two personal boats one 20 ft and the other 36, as well a community water shuttle that docks at Stuart Town dock

(2) How often do you transit this waterway?

We live west of the inlet and thus each day on the water includes both an east and a west passage. On average 3 times a week, thus 6 times a week, from October to June...

(3) If railway traffic impedes your navigation of this area, how long are you normally delayed?
The rail bridge on more than one occasion has caused back ups of 15 minutes to over one hour! Critically at this navigation point, the larger bridge allows small and medium boats through without an opening. When the rail bridge is down, virtually all traffic comes to a stand still. 

(4) How would you propose to regulate the balance of railway and maritime traffic in this area? 
My view on this is unchanged from the last time you surveyed us. First, bridge openings should be coordinated and predictable. Second, the acute issue is the rail bridge, given the above comment in previous question. I would propose that both bridges open every half hour at the top and bottom of the hour for 10 minutes or on demand . 

(5) What challenges have you experienced when transiting this area due to these bridges and/or railway activity? 

The rail bridge not operating on a schedule and with large variance in how long it remains down is a huge issue...The unprdicatble and prolonged delays have spoiled countless outings and adventures for boaters in the area and my family in particular.
The entire access for those coming across the state, or the north and south forks of the St Lucie River , representing thousands home owners and millions of dollars depend on predictable and reliable access to that waterway and the inlet and inter -coastal. The rail project brings a massive negative benefit to the immediate area as there is not even a stop, and increased noise and inconvenience to those on land and on water in Stuart! So it quite literally is a project benefiting a large hedge fund and those outside our area built on our backs!

(6) At what frequency and duration should the drawbridge openings occur in order to meet the needs of navigation?

First, bridge openings should be coordinated and predictable. Second, the acute issue is the rail bridge, given the above comment in previous question. I would propose that both bridges open every half hour at the top and bottom of the hour for 10 minutes.

There is apparently a suggestion of 15 minutes every hour, where it might be 15 minutes at the top oof hour one, yet 15 minutes at the bottom of hour two?? Totally unacceptable and would represent a huge and grossly unfair access to an incredible vital passage way for all mariners in the area. 

(7) Should the SR 707 (Dixie Hwy) Bridge opening schedule mirror the operating schedule of the FEC Railroad Bridge?

Yes, although I would suggest that the rail bridge should always be open if non scheduled trains. But for sure should be open at the ""opening"" times at the top and the bottom of the hour as I have proposed. As I have explained, the rail bridge is the big issue, if open more it would allow smaller boats able to fit under the big bridge, more frequent passage,  that would help the amount of traffic that would be waiting at the top and bottom of the hour.",,,,,,,

When held at the RR bridge when down it varies from 15 to 25 minutes per train, your hope when waiting is that it's only one train. The amount of boat traffic especially on a weekend in this area is extremely busy, currently depending on the size of the boats you cannot pass each other traveling east and west because of how narrow the train bridge opening is and when the current is ripping slipping by each other can be a real challenge. Anything over 34' forget passing by each other. As it is now with being a minimum wake area depending on traffic it can take 5-7 minutes to get through the entire area and out past the Roosevelt Bridge with following each other through even without waiting because of the train bridge being down. 
It seems to me that at a minimum, the bottom of the RR bridge should be raised up to 14' to match the draw bridge just to the west, then at least most boats can continue through without creating a major traffic jamb on both sides traveling east and west. I've always thought (30 years) at least that the RR bridge should have been torn down and rebuilt higher well before the presence of Brightline, always been too low and too narrow! Draw bridge should not mimic this schedule because this schedule should not be considered, there is just too much boat traffic for this too be implemented. Frankly addressing these types of obstacles now is irresponsible and embarrassing on Brightline's, Martin County and the Coast Guard's part. The feasibility studies should have been done long ago so that we could all work towards a smart solution, this proposed solution is not smart and more importantly it's not safe for boating traffic. We need real solutions to keep traffic moving safely and timely, now is not the time to get lazy on ideas and take the cheap or easy path. If it's that important for South Florida to get to Central Florida then lets at least have the gut's to hold companies and folks to ""Do The Right Thing"" and do this thing the right way!",,,,,,,

Week day travel is not too bad since the bridge is open unless a train passes through. On the weekend it is an entirely different situation since boat traffic is greatly increased and many times there is a moving tide which creates problems for inexperienced boaters and for larger vessels which cannot just stop in place. The proposed time change is ridiculous and I believe an illegal change since boats always have the "" right of way "" as the waterways came first. The proposed train does not have the right to supercede this. If a train approaches, it can stop and wait whereas boats cannot. Whomever is pushing this change needs to be informed of the boats right of way and that boat traffic supercedes the train. We as local boater have seen the rail company lie time and time again, and their recent decision to not replace the aged and deficit bridge is yet another reason they are not to be trusted, and we will fight this through our local representatives vigaralously.

The current in that area is very strong whether it is incoming tide or outgoing tide causing dangerous situations  for boat damage, bridge damage and most important could lead to injuries or deaths..  The property values that homeowners west of the crossing will decrease due to not accessible waterway.
I propose either building the bridge up so that there is a clearance of a minimum 40 ft at center or use the track out west by passing stuart.
This proposal is not good for stuart / palm city.   If this railway is allowed to happen the way its proposed there will be injuries and or deaths that will happen.

The railroad bridge was given authority to cross the river and water traffic was not to be delayed and water traffic has always had priority. The railway bridge now delays water traffic but is tolerated and managed with help from the Rosevelt Bridge operator making sure they open immediately after trains are run. I use the bridge four times a week and have noticed both bridges raking advantage of the current changes. The Rosevelt Bridge used to open on demand. This changed due to the main bridge having structure problems. Now that the main new bridge has been repaired, the old Rosevelt Bridge never went back to open on demand and delays to water traffic has increased. I never was delayed with the open on demand and now I always get delays
due to the Rosevelt opening twice per hour and then the train bridge closing as needed. I have noticed several vessel backed up and congestion of late. The Rosevelt should have went back to open on demand to offset the railway schedule. One 30 foot or larger vessel can only fit through the railway bridge. It takes my bigger boat 5 mins to clear both bridges. Each time I come to the bridges lately I have noticed a parade of vessels and near misses trying to get through. The railroad should close on needs for rail traffic and the Rosevelt should go back to open on demand. You can not expect the vessel to clear with this short window.",,,,,,,

Yes at least once a week

(2) How often do you transit this waterway? At least once a week if not twice a week

(3) If railway traffic impedes your navigation of this area, how long are you normally delayed? Sometimes it’s only 20 minutes but other times it’s been an hour and a half Which is completely unacceptable especially if severe weather is near

(4) How would you propose to regulate the balance of railway and maritime traffic in this area?
The real ways should remain up and open for boat traffic at all times unless the train is coming
(5) What challenges have you experienced when transiting this area due to these bridges and/or railway activity? Inability to get to safety during severe weather

(6) At what frequency and duration should the drawbridge openings occur in order to meet the needs of navigation? Again the bridges should remain open and free for boat traffic at all times until the train is coming. 

(7) Should the SR 707 (Dixie Hwy) Bridge opening schedule mirror the operating schedule of the FEC Railroad Bridge? I don’t know that schedule so I can’t answer. ",,,,,,,

It has compounded by the growth rate in Martin & Saint Lucie counties and the number of boats utilizing this area of waterway to access the ICW and the Saint Lucie Inlet areas especially on the weekends. This area has seen a huge influx of boats of every kind along with many inexperienced boat operators that lack basic boating Skills or Courtesy operating vessels with excessive power. There is no right of way knowledge amongst most and it’s more of a every man for himself. The new operating schedule for the old Roosevelt traffic bridge already has vessels piling up during peak weekend times and it has become increasingly more dangerous to navigate a less maneuverable vessel amongst these bridges. In addition the new mega yacht Marina being constructed on the old Evinrude test site will further add to congestion in this area. A less maneuverable vessel such as a sailboat getting trapped in between those bridges with current, wind and a mob of impatient boat operators along with a shortened opening schedule such as proposed has the potential to be very dangerous and should be evaluated very carefully. 
I also think it’s an embarrassment that this is just now being addressed and find it hard to believe no one considered the impact of a high speed train with such a frequent operating schedule and the impact to an outdated railroad bridge which already has a history of high maintenance.  Briteline is currently running test operations and many if not most of the new track has been laid and the various roadway crossings modified and at what seems like the last hour the coast guard is proposing a new vessel restrictive drawbridge schedule. It seems obvious to me that this is just damage control for an already decided schedule for a train service that has no stops or adds any value to the area it’s impacting but these are my concerns none the less.

If the railroad bridge is down, it dramatically increases the time it will take emergency responders to get to an incident west of the railroad bridge.  

I own a boat.  I am out on the water often.  There have been numerous times where the short amount of time that the railroad bridge is down now creates quite a backup of boaters trying to get through, waiting for the bridge to go back up.  The automobile bridge has a limit right now that it can not be open longer than 4 minutes.  I have seen several times where that bridge must go down without all the boats that had been held up by the railroad bridge closure being able to pass.  With all the boats waiting, patience runs thin among boaters.  If the closure goes longer, making more boats wait longer, it is my opinion that there will be alot more boating accidents in that area whenever the railroad bridge does go up if it is kept down for even 30 minutes at a time on a regular basis.

So firstly I believe they need to be held accountable for that scam and need to fork up for a train station in Martin County if they pass through at all.
But secondly this is a cross Florida  navigable waterway,  Used for commercial and recreational watercraft.   It is unthinkable that rail activity  mostly could stop shipping and boating in the area  and that any group or cooperation could expect this to happen.  Thousands and thousands of people will be negatively impacted if there isn't a second bridge and if residents and property owners don't have the majority of time available for unhindered transit under the Roosevelt Bridge.  As it is, The bridge is incredibly outdated updated and problematic.  It will lower and the train will not show up for 20 minutes.
A rail line and bridge high enough to not need to open is THE ONLY OPTION and Brightline should not operate a single train in Martin County until it s built.",,,,,,,

I have been traversing under this bridge many times over the past dozen years, and if I were to add the number of traverses done by the 300 boating families in this club during this period it would total many thousands.  My observations and suggestions are below:

1)  Many boats traverse this waterway, but the traffic patterns are not uniform throughout the  24 hour day .  Many more boats traverse during daylight hours, fewer at night.   Certain days of the week and weeks of the year have much heavier boating traffic than others.   If the US Coast Guard can set a schedule that takes these traffic patterns into account, it will be a great service to the total community.

2)  The boating safety issues raised by many commenters are real.  I have witnessed unsafe boating operations in the bridge crossing area numerous times, but this is most serious when there are large numbers of boats stacking up on both sides of the bridge waiting for an opening. 

3.  The nearby roadway drawbridge must have records regarding its openings and closings that would be helpful in determining boat traffic flows.  Small boats with clearances below 10 feet can normally pass underneath without waiting for a bridge opening, but the data should be helpful.

•A schedule such as this reduces the appeal of living upriver of this bridge. This will devalue all properties upriver of the bridge, lowering tax base hurting more than just homeowners.

•Massive boat traffic jams will occur, causing a hazard to navigation, accidents and potential injury.

* This waterway is the only route from east of the bridge to Lake Okeechobee, and is the safest and most direct route from east of the bridge to the Florida west coast.
* It is the only route from the South and North forks of the St. Lucie River to the ICW and St. Lucie Inlet.  There are hundreds of registered vessels at marinas or moorings in these waterways.  Reducing transit through the bridge effectively cuts off these major waterways from access to the Atlantic. 
*  Many boaters navigating this narrow passage face tide, current and wind conditions which are a hazard even when given plenty of time.  Reducing the time for transit will increase hazards and lead to accidents and injury or death.
* The weekend traffic already generates many vessels in queue.  Adding time to this queue will increase congestion. When boaters are lined up to transit, this crowding can lead to (and has led to) collisions, groundings and boat damage, especially for sailboats. 
* Boats in queue for long periods generate excessive gasoline consumption, pollution and noise, which also negatively impacts the St. Lucie Estuary and nearby homeowners.
* Sailboats are the vessels who most often require the drawbridge to open due to their masts. Navigating tides, current and wind is always more treacherous for sailboats in this narrow passage, because our motors are not as powerful as power boats, and our keels make running aground more likely.  Queuing to pass is therefore doubly difficult for the boats who most require the drawbridge to be opened.  Adding time to the queue will exacerbate this problem. 
* Limiting the time available for boats to pass under the bridge negatively impacts property values for those with boat docks (whether east or west of the bridge), because the value of boat docks decreases in proportion with the difficulty of making the transit under the bridge. Many are unable or unwilling to endure long, dangerous boat queues.  It is not acceptable to negatively impact these property owners for the convenience of the Brightline.
* Many boaters east of the bridge seek shelter from hurricanes in marinas west of the locks, and this route provides the only access to the locks. In addition, those sheltering from hurricanes generate huge boat traffic and hazardous queues. The always-treacherous wind and current conditions for boats queuing to transit are exacerbated during weather emergencies, adding to an already dangerous situation.

Here are my answers to these questions:
(1) Do you currently transit through the FEC Railroad Bridge crossing the Okeechobee Waterway, mile 7.4, at Stuart, Florida? Yes

(2) How often do you transit this waterway? Weekly

(3) If railway traffic impedes your navigation of this area, how long are you normally delayed? 30 minutes

(4) How would you propose to regulate the balance of railway and maritime traffic in this area? Do not reduce the transit time for boats who are already crowding to pass through.

(5) What challenges have you experienced when transiting this area due to these bridges and/or railway activity? Tides, current and wind are always treacherous for sailboats in this narrow passage, because our motors are not as powerful as power boats, and our keels make running aground more likely.  Queuing to pass is therefore difficult.  While waiting to pass, the boats lining up for passage do not always respect the rules of the road, and we have almost collided with unskilled boat captains.  The time for passage is already at a premium, and reducing the time will lead to more dangerous conditions, especially for sailboats like our 34' sloop.

(6) At what frequency and duration should the drawbridge openings occur in order to meet the needs of navigation? No change to the current schedule.

(7) Should the SR 707 (Dixie Hwy) Bridge opening schedule mirror the operating schedule of the FEC Railroad Bridge? Should follow by appropriate interval to allow for transit of FEC bridge.",,,,,,,

I too have shared a similar path. I am a 30 year retired veteran of Marine Law Enforcement with the Roosevelt Bridge and the train bridge being within my area of responsibility. With that being said,I am very familiar with the treacherous conditions transitioning the narrow railroad bridge. This area is subject to strong currents due to its underwater topography. Many vessel operators have struggled to maintain position during close bridge operations, as well as navigate the restrictive narrow train bridge opening with other vessel traffic.
I feel this would exasperate the problem with only having the railroad bridge open 15 minutes per hour. From a public safety standpoint, I think that will create an absolute hazard. The St. Lucie River/Okeechobee Waterway also serves as a hurricane evaluation route for boaters looking to flee the East coast with inclement weather.
Currently I transit this area 4 to 6 times per week.If the train bridge is down,I would say a fair average would be 20 minutes of wait time.  From a public safety aspect, I feel it would only be reasonable to maintain the railroad bridge in the up position at a minimum of 30 minutes per hour.
Thank You Again for what you do

During that time we have frequently taken our boat out towards the St. Lucie inlet for various reasons.  Additionally, a member of our household is a practicing physician, and when the Roosevelt bridge was under repair and he was on Stemi call, the option of boating to Martin North was comforting, as it took much longer by car to get to a critical patient at that time.  That is only one example of free boating enhancing the public safety and well being of our citizens. There are many other instances that would warrant us to use a boat for recreational and also more urgent purposes.  If the train bridge is only open for 15 minute increments each hour we STRONGLY feel that this will harm our community and even affect safety of our citizens.  We are opposed to this decision therefore and urge you to consider more reasonable options.  Our entire community WILL be affected financially, socially, and physically.  Thank you.

Recently the Roosevelt Bridge closed due to issues with the concrete. That directed all traffic to the Dixie Hwy draw bridge which is parallel to the  railroad bridge. What happens is the draw bridge will only open when the railroad bridge is up too. This can cause a boat traffic jam. Then when they open the draw bridge they leave open for much longer to allow all the backed boat traffic to clear. This causes a major roadway traffic jamb. So my point is if the railroad bridge is going to be lowered more for more frequent train traffic then it when cause boat and roadway traffic issues. Just something to keep in mind.",,,,,,,

As many other local captains have stated through the comments I've read the proposed schedule is not only inconvenient, it is dangerous and costly.  As large and small boats gather daily, and especially on busy weekends and holidays, the traffic can get very tight with boats piling up and causing some bad situations.  It is a bottleneck between the East and West sides of the waterway, with thousands of boaters on both sides.  The only solution I can think of, is a major bridge project, which I think should be explored as part of this conversation,  Tempoararily, a quick an intermittent schedule that runs on a time schedule with the Brightline.  The trains pass through quickly, but the time it takes to life the bridge and close it is not as such.  In my estimation and experience the bridge takes about 5-7 minutes to lift and another 5-7 mins to close.  That is about a 15 minute wait every time the train moves past, not including the freight trains.  This is unacceptable and has a huge impact on our quality of life here in Stuart and St Lucie County who are boaters that live West of the bridge.  The value on our waterfront homes will be significant and I'm concerned about who in our political class will address this also.  I would prefer a major bridge project than a quick fix so Brightline can get their way.  We need to create a fixed arch bridge so boaters and residents of Stuart can move freely through the waterway and don't have to foot the bill in lifestyle degradation, liability and property values to accommodate north and south expansion.

Chapter 700, Ports and Waterways Safety Authorities, promotes safety and the environmental quality of ports, harbors, waterfront areas, and navigable waters of the United States. The Coast Guard has been given broad authority to take action to prevent damage to, or the destruction or loss of, any vessel, bridge, or other structure on or in U.S. navigable waters, or any land structure or shore area immediately adjacent to those waters; and to protect the navigable waters and resources therein from environmental harm resulting from vessel or structural damage, destruction, or loss.

On September 3, 2014, Florida East Coast Railway (FECR) discussed its interest in moving Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) with the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA).  FECR petitioned the FRA to ship LNG on its network between the Hialeah Rail Yard in Miami and the Bowden Rail Yard in Jacksonville, Florida.  The route for that virtual rolling natural gas pipeline on wheels would encompass the Saint Lucie River Railroad Bridge.

In a letter dated March 3, 2016, from the FRA to FECR, the FRA noted, ""But the unique challenges posed by the rail transportation of LNG require us to ensure that we are doing everything we can to keep railroad employees and communities along the proposed routes safe.  FEC's proposed LNG transportation routes traverse congested, highly populated areas, with frequent highway-rail grade crossings.  Any LNG transported along the proposed routes would eventually share the routes with high-performance passenger trains operating at speeds of up to 110 mph.""1  Top speed for LNG rail transport is 40 mph.

If LNG is going to be transported across the Saint Lucie River Railroad Bridge, the USCG should prepare an Area Contingency Plan (ACP) in the event of a collision between a train hauling LNG and Brightline, or in the event of a derailment or other accident involving the release of flammable vapor-gas followed by a flash fire and/or explosion on the Saint Lucie River Railroad Bridge.

The USCG's proposed closing of this bridge for up to 45 minutes per hour will have a significant negative impact both on mine and many other Martin County residents' quality of life and finances, as follows;

1.  Boating safety issues.  On any given day literally hundreds of boats pass through the bridges's existing narrow navigable gap.  Forcing all of this boat traffic to transit the gap in both directions in 15 minute intervals will likely result in boaters speeding up in order to get through the gap prior to its closing.  Many large boats will be competing with smaller boats to ""run the gap"" in both directions so as not to be delayed another 45 minutes.  This will undoubtedly result in collisions, injuries and fatalities.  At a minimum, a study should be conducted to determine average boating traffic through the railroad bridge gap during peak times and if a fixed schedule is to be used it should be variable and determined upon boating traffic.   Dixie Highway bridge openings should not be considered in the study as many of the boats that pass under this bridge without opening will not fit under the railroad bridge when it is in its closed position.

2.  Financial impact to residents.  A large percentage of Martin County's population lives west of the railroad tracks and the bridge.  Those with waterfront or direct access properties will experience a significant decrease in property value due to what will in effect be  a change from properties with no fixed bridge access to the ocean to fixed bridge access with only 6 foot of clearance.  Non waterfront residents with boats on trailers will now be forced to use launching facilities east of the railroad bridge, resulting in additional costs, not to mention inconvenience.  All boaters having to pass through the railroad bridge gap will also be financially impacted by have to use significantly more fuel to remain in position for up to 45 minutes awaiting the opening of the bridge.

3.  Negative financial impact on Martin County.  As the waterfront properties diminish in value so will Martin County's tax base diminish, resulting in less property tax revenue collected.

4.  Equity and fairness.  Boaters and waterfront property owners living west of the railroad bridge made their real estate decisions based upon the current normally ""up"" position of the railroad bridge with intermittent closings for freight train traffic.  Changing to an essentially normally ""down"" position bridge to accommodate a for profit venture is highly unfair to the thousands of residents who it will negatively impact.  Adding to the unfairness, Brightline reneged on a promise to rebuild the bridge and its approaches which would have resulted in a higher than 6 foot elevation allowing many more boats to pass while in the down position.  

Conclusions and suggestions.  Right now Brightline operates one train per hour seven times a day between Miami and West Palm  Although they have not announced their proposed schedule for travel to Orlando, considering it is a 2 hour trip each way on what is primarily a single track they may only require one opening every two hours seven time per day, clearly not justifying 45 minutes of bridge closure every hour.  It would seem to be a more equitable division of consideration of train and maritime traffic for the bridge to be normally open and closed as needed for train traffic, as it has been for almost 100 years.  I and the boating community understand that there will be more closings to accommodate the additional train traffic but also hope that the closings will be for shorter periods of time as the passenger trains will be much shorter in length and likely traveling at a greater speed than freight traffic.  I strongly suggest that the Coast Guards proposed rule not be adopted at this time and that the current bridge opening protocols be maintained for at least the first year of operation of Brightline's usage of the bridge, with a possible fixed closing schedule revisited based upon the experiences over that year.

Yes, I regularly transit the FEC railroad bridge at mile 7.4 of the Ockeechobee Waterway
2. As a Martin County resident on a canal off the North Fork of the St Lucie river, I have 2 boat....a smaller 24 foot outboard that transits roughly twice a week and a 45 sailboat that transits 10 times a year.
3. When the railway bridge comes down, it is usually a 30-45 minute delay.
4. Ensure the railroad schedule is published and ahered to...maybe provide and smartphone app that tells the next  few times that bridge will close. Given the amount of traffic the waterway must be open at least half the daylight hours. Otherwise boat traffic will back up and given the bottleneck at the train bridge. Bightline could also invest in some interim technology to reduce the amount of time required to block the channel......today the train crossing is a very small percentage of the time the channel is blocked. Of course the solution is a modern bridge but that is going to take a while.

5. Challenges. During busy periods large numbers of boats try to get thru the single lane passage at the same time. This is very hazardous when piloting a larger less maneuverable boat. Even worse when being towed through the opening. The proposed 15 minutes/hour is not nearly enough time for the boat traffic to pass

6. No, as stated above too many boats to pass in that length of time...especially when larger boats that require the car bridge to be open as well.

7. Of course the two bridges must coordinate the openings....there is no room between the bridges to wait in a larger boat much less with a bunch of boats

Yes I regularly transit through the FEC Railroad Bridge crossing the Okeechobee Waterway mile 7.4 at Stuart FL.
2. I transit this waterway 2-3 times per week.
3. If railway traffic impedes my navigation of this area it usually takes at least 30 minutes delay before the bridge reopens.
4. There should be no less than equal balance for boaters but that is still going to be impactful. The schedule needs to be well published so that people can plan. Send the railway traffic thought at night when there is little maritime traffic. Better still the railway should be run west of I95 and not though downtown Stuart. Aside from the impact of the bridge this is going to ruin the community of Stuart and lower our property values.
5. When the railway bridge is down, the number of vessels waiting to transit builds up quickly. We have a 45' sailboat which is difficult to start/stop quickly and in heavy traffic can be quite dangerous. If the bridge is only open for 15 minutes at a time, there will be significant backup of vessels, likely more than can transit in 15 minutes. Since you can only transit one direction at a time, operators will become impatient and attempt unsafe passing to try and get through within the time limit. 
6. 15 minutes will not be enough for the safe transit of all waiting vessels. If a boat can't get through in the 15 minutes you have to wait another 45 minutes?! This is ridiculous and there is no other option. 
7. Yes the Dixie Highway Bridge opening should be exactly the same as the operating schedule of the FEC railroad bridge. There is no point having one open without the other.",,,,,,,

I believe that the USCG proposed changes would be unsafe and unfair to the boating public.

I've lived on the water on the west side of the drawbridge for 22 years. I transit through the bridges a few times per month in summer and monthly in winter. With the current 20 minute opening schedule for the draw bridge and the open-by-default policy of the railroad bridge, the number of boats which queue up in both directions is already so numerous that it takes up to 20 minutes to clear the queues, not to mention the added risks of collisions, especially at peak tide changes.

If a 15 minute per hour opening schedule were established, I don't believe that the number of boats queued could transit in 15 minutes, effectively causing an hour or more wait. The slow speed of the railroad bridge opening and closing also amplifies the delays caused by a closed-by-default policy.

I suggest that replacing the railroad bridge be a prerequisite to schedule changes. Only then, do I believe that considering a reduction of the opening policies of the bridges to be fair and safe for the boating public.

     Yes, I do transit through the bridge and railroad opening.

(2) How often do you transit this waterway?  One or twice during the weekday and at least once during the weekend.

(3) If railway traffic impedes your navigation of this area, how long are you normally delayed?
     Yes it happens and delays can be up to 15 minutes.


(4) How would you propose to regulate the balance of railway and maritime traffic in this area?
     I would recommend at the minimum and equitable 50/50% on the hour.  Rail crossing have absolutely no greater importance than boat crossings. 

(5) What challenges have you experienced when transiting this area due to these bridges and/or railway activity?
     Currently at the best of times the bridge and railroad crossing are adequate to say the least.  The height of both the Rosevelt Bridge and the Rail line impact the flow of boat crossing this at times causing dangerous situations where boaters are lined up and some do not know the rule of crossing and accidents are possible and happen.
(6) At what frequency and duration should the drawbridge openings occur in order to meet the needs of navigation?
     Negating the fact the the drawbridge should be raised and reconstructed as mentioned above the minimum duration should be equitable (50/50).

(7) Should the SR 707 (Dixie Hwy) Bridge opening schedule mirror the operating schedule of the FEC Railroad Bridge?
     If possible the SR707 Bridge opening schedule should be on a boater request with safety concerns considered along with the Railroad bridge i.e. the railroad bridge would mirror the SR707 Bridge openings.

We have lived here for 12 years and navigate under the train bridge several times a month to go by boat to restaurants in downtown Stuart or go out the inlet for fishing or to the sandbar.   Having increased train traffic and drawbridge closings will greatly impact not only the value of our home but also will reduce our enjoyment and frequency of using our boat.  It had been speculated that the drawbridge will only be OPEN 15 min. every hour.  This will cause a logjam of boats on bith the east and west sides of the bridge.  We have already experienced dangerous situations where 30 or more boats are on the east side in between bridges waiting for the drawbridge to open.  We have actually seen two boats collide due to the strong current and small space to navigate in when waiting for the bridge.   I cannot imagine this situation if there is less time for the bridge to be open.
This is just one of the many problems for boaters.  In addition, the risk of accidents for motorists and pedestrians with increased train activity should be top concern.   There has already been a train derailment in Jensen Beach....brush fires near homes where sparks from train wheels have ignited the brush and increased noise disturbance all night long.
Also, living in a community that is west of the tracks and the nearest hospital is EAST of the tracks is a huge concern with added closures preventing emergency vehicles from getting to the hospital.
The best solution would be to divert the train passage west of I95 starting in West Palm or Jupiter and running it out west through Martin County.
The current infrastructure in Martin County cannot sustain or support the multiple daily high speed train traffic. ",,,,,,,

To allow boat traffic to pass. Depending on the day the bridge maybe up for 10-15 minutes, further congesting traffic in down town stuart. Martin county's growth management is lacking management and planning.

I have waited as long  as 45mins  for a train to pass while idling in the channel with handfuls of other boaters who just want to rush through the narrow passage while disregarding boater etiquette and other common boater rules. It will only get worse when they build the new Marina in that little pocket to side of the bridge.

No single corporation should have the right to change bridge opening and closure schedules.  It’s just wrong.  I’m the type of individual who can point out issues but I typically have solutions or at least recommendation to think about. 

The Seikan railway tunnel in Japan passes beneath the Tsugaru Straight connecting Honshu and Hokkaido Islands.  Construction started in 1971 and was completed in 1988.  Basically, this is the longest undersea railway tunnel.  50 trains a day travel through the tunnel providing freight and passenger services. This railway is capable of running Bullet trains. The Channel Tunnel (Euro Tunnel) runs beneath the English Channel connecting England to France. These railways are again used for freight and passenger traffic.  Trains are capable of traveling at speeds of 100mph.  

When the Rossevelt bridge replacement was being proposed, there were those among us that supported a tunnel as opposed to a high rise bridge that would obscure the beautiful view of the west end of the St. Lucie River. Therefore, I’m thinking that Briteline could replace the aging bridge with a railway tunnel. This way Brightline could travel under the river (where they will end up anyway) instead of over the river on a bridge. I’m not an engineer so I can’t contribute detailed plans for a railway tunnel. The end result is that Florida East Coast Rail and Brightline can traverse the waterway under water in a tunnel.  Problem solved!  The old bridge becomes like the Bridge Over The River Kwai and there is wide open space for boating to safely travel through the narrow passage.  ",,,,,,,

Yes
(2) How often do you transit this waterway?
Four times per month on average.
(3) If railway traffic impedes your navigation of this area, how long are you normally delayed?
10-15 minutes
(4) How would you propose to regulate the balance of railway and maritime traffic in this area?
Maritime traffic would be most efficient with the FEC railroad bridge and the Dixie Hwy bridge openings coordinated, openings on a known schedule, openings lasting more than 15 minutes unless all maritime traffic has cleared, at least two openings per hour.  There are certain times when maritime traffic is heavy requiring extended openings.  The width of the opening at the FEC crossing is not sufficient for two larger boats, approximately 30' or more to safely transverse the FEC opening at the same time, requiring captains of vessels to coordinate with each other via VHF radio to avoid an unsafe situation when going through the FEC opening.  This adds to the time to get all vessels in the que through the passing.  The backup of vessels awaiting a bridge opening creates a dangerous situation which needs to be minimized, thus an opening of at least twice an hour.   There are also unique situations where commercial vessels such as barges and dredges need to clear the bridge channel for just themselves which can take 20+ minutes for just their individual passage while other vessels await their turn.  This is not frequent, but there needs to be a way to accommodate the passage of slow, large vessels.
(5) What challenges have you experienced when transiting this area due to these bridges and/or railway activity?
If the Dixie Hwy bridge is open and the FEC rail bridge is closed, there is no passing.  Coordination of the FEC rail bridge and the Dixie Hwy bridge are essential.
(6) At what frequency and duration should the drawbridge openings occur in order to meet the needs of navigation?
As discussed above, at least twice an hour and sufficient time to clear all maritime traffic which should be more than 15 minutes unless light traffic requires less time.  There are certain situations and busy periods of time such as weekends that require extended opening times as discussed above.  I use the Dixie Hwy bridge by car as well, so a known schedule would help motorists as well.
(7) Should the SR 707 (Dixie Hwy) Bridge opening schedule mirror the operating schedule of the FEC Railroad Bridge?
Yes",,,,,,,

We have been active in U.S. Power and Sail Squadron and Great Lakes Sailing Club.  While living aboard our 50' Carver motor yacht in the Stuart area, we rented a transient slip at Sunset Bay Marina and Anchorage just west of the railroad bridge in question. We currently live in Jensen Beach, Florida and are members of Care Free Boat Club.  We ""borrow"" a boat multiple times a month from the Stuart location just east of the railroad bridge.  So, we are very familiar with the waterways in the area and have first hand knowledge of the amount of river traffic and the difficulty timing our arrival for bridge openings.  The problem is compounded as there is a highway bridge just yards from the railroad bridge.  The staging areas on both the east and west sides of this bridge are small, confined spaces. Currents are running through this narrow opening and, as boats pile up waiting for a bridge opening, maneuverability (to keep a boat in position) becomes difficult and the potential for boating accidents increases.  We have waited as long as 45 minutes, jockeying to stay in position, at this closed bridge, since the bridge closes at least 15 minutes before the train arrives and stays closed nearly 15 minutes after the train passes.  If the winds are up, if it is storming the situation is exacerbated. It is as critical to keep river traffic flowing as it is to allow train traffic to pass.  Therefore, we suggest that the railroad bridge be open to boat traffic the same amount of time as it is closed for train traffic, or at minimum to have bridge openings every hour and half-hour.  This is not merely a matter of convenience for the boating public, it is a matter of safety.",,,,,,,

Compound this with the increase of inexperienced boaters, further restrictions of the already difficult-to-navigate stretch of waterway will be disastrous. While I understand the need/wants of Brightline, if scheduling changes to this already dilapidated bridge were going to be necessary, they should have been brought to the surface a long time ago. The correct answer is a new bridge/tunnel to address the aging infrastructure, but now there not likely enough time. Thus, since this was an afterthought, the public should not need to suffer the poor planning of Brightline. I highly recommend the USCG considers the voice of the public and denies the changes to the bridge schedule.

Not to mention the real potential for safety issues during times of impending inclement weather where boaters will be forced to wait extended long periods of time on one side of the bridge or the other.  It’s essential that there is a more fair and equitable plan to better balance the needs and interests of boaters and Brightline/railroad traffic alike.

It's clear that theee will be ever frequennt periods of drawbridge closed time, denying passage by marine traffic for ever increasing frequency and intervals.

Simply put, a ""High Bridge"" over the Saint Lucie River is needed to eliminate the Drawbridge and should have been in the planning for passenger service 
years ago. As we're experiencing significant growth in the Treasure Coast, a high bridge is, in fact, the only solution that adequately accomodates both modes of transport and recreation. Any regulation must include a negotiated settlement on the time of completion for the High Bridge that includes reversion to the present pre-passenger rail traffic drawbridge operation. Otherwise it is equitable to the mariners to be penalized by the cost avoidence that the Coast Guard  would enable the passenger rail to foist on the mariners. It will eventually depress the St Lucie area economic output, resulting in losses of local jobs and tax revenue.

I have seen at times several boats on each side trying to maneuver due to the current and this is just with the freight trains.Closing the bridge 45 minutes each hour is going to create a boating hazard as the number of boats is sure to increase.  Many of us know that a freight train is going to be on the bridge around 7 am every morning so everyone tries to get there before then. When a schedule is posted that the bridge will be open for 15 minutes imagine the number of boats that will show up.

The bridge should open immediately after railroad use and the railroad owners should assure that it is maintained properly to open quickly and safely. 

I currently utilize this waterway several times a week and typically travel through the railroad bridge headed to the Stuart inlet.   I have been delayed by the railroad bridge many times.  The delay has been as long as 30 minutes.  There is no communication (app) available to know when the bridge is down and when it will go up.  During peak periods of boat usage with the bridge down, I have witnessed 20 boats backed up trying the navigate the current, avoid the other boats,  and 2 other bridges adjacent to the railroad bridge.  During holidays, like the 4th of July there were at least 100 boats trying to get through the railroad bridge which was down.  I have witnessed boats towed through the bridge, I have seen a boat break down in the bridge opening,  and I have seen people tow kids on tubes through the bridge. There is no clear right of way through the bridge.  The bridge opening is narrow and if a large boat goes through all the other boaters must move out of the way.  Any attempt to schedule the bridge opening will make this sequence happen almost every day. By scheduling the opening of the bridge, you will be making travel through the bridge less safe. 

No one currently knows the actual utilization of the train.  I believe it will be far less than what was projected by the train owners.  I am confident that the business case used by the train owners was optimistic.  Public transportation is Florida is extremely lightly used.  I am hopeful that once the real utilization is known, that the train owners adjust their schedule.  I urge you to wait until this process settles out after a year of so of train use before implementing any changes, as well as monitoring bridge incidents (if any) before implementing a railroad bridge opening schedule.  You are jumping the gun.

2) We transit by boat through the waterway an average of four times per week.  In addition, we observe the maritime traffic from our home, on a daily basis.
3) When we are delayed by the railroad bridge, we generally wait 20 minutes. We have observed that most of that wait is from the time the bridge comes down until the train arrives.  Once the train passes, the bridge opens very quickly (unless a second train is coming. UGGH.) Therefore, it appears that the bridge is placed in the down position very early, perhaps as a safety measure to ensure that a train can stop in time if the 100+ year old bridge doesn’t lock in place properly?  This is understandable for a freight train with tremendous momentum.  However, the last time we were stopped, just last week, after the long wait it was a very short brightline train that came by.  Surely that train can stop quickly if necessary.  
4) How would we proposed to regulate the balance of railway and maritime traffic? Firstly, only opening the bridge to maritime traffic for 15 min per hour, as proposed by Brightline, is unacceptable and not equitable.  We think it would be reasonable to allow no more than two trains per hour on a posted schedule that will allow boaters to plan for these delays.  Based on my observations, this would provide 20 minutes per hour for boaters which is much less than the current operation but can be managed.  When the bridge is down, a number of boats begin to idle on both sides of the bridge waiting for it to reopen.  On the weekends they can easily number 10-15 boats on each side.  With additional train traffic this will only worsen.  Once the bridge opens, these boats try to quickly get through the narrow opening that is known for significant currents.  It can be a dangerous situation.   We would suggest that a red light / green light system be installed so that once the bridge is up, boats will traverse in one direction at a time.  
5) What challenges have we experienced? As mentioned before, there is a safety issue when many boats try to get through the bridge opening at the same time and going in both directions.  With additional closures, we are also concerned about the additional air emissions from these motors idling in the area for such a long time.  Finally, as mentioned before, it appears that the bridge is closing approx 15 minutes before the train arrives.  If there is anyway to reduce this time so that the bridge is down only for a few minutes before and after each train, it would significantly reduce the impact to maritime traffic.
6) What frequency and duration would we suggest?  We believe it is reasonable to expect the train bridge to be down for no more than two trains per hour and for no more than 15 minutes at a time.  This would include ALL train traffic, passenger and freight!
7) Should the 707 schedule mirror the railroad bridge? I am one of the many boaters that is NOT impacted by the 707 bridge schedule as our boat is low enough to traverse when that bridge is down.  Therefore, it isn’t appropriate for me to comment on this question.
Additional comments:
My educated guess is that at least 80% of the boats that traverse this area are able to go under the SR707 bridge without it opening.  If there is data on this, I would love to see it, as I think it may actually be a bigger number!  Therefore, we were supportive of the agreement that Brightline made with Martin County that included building a new rail bridge that would be higher than the current one and similar in height (above the waterline) as the SR 707 bridge.  We would ask that the USCG insist that Brightline proceed with replacing the current  bridge so that this scheduling issue is only a temporary problem.  The bridge is more than 100 years old and is disrepair.  There are wires hanging down under each of the fixed spans and evidence of large boats and barges that have struck the piling and structures.  The lights are old and not very visible at night or in inclement weather.  Even without the addition of 16 trains per day, this bridge was overdue for replacement.  ",,,,,,,

As a long time boater and resident of Martin county, I oppose Brightline's proposal to limit hours of opening on the Roosevelt Bridge. Openings are currently on will call for boaters,based on a number of factors. IE, auto traffic,train schedule and number of boats awaiting an opening. There are millions of dollars of boats in the St. Lucie river that go thru the Roosevelt daily to get to the Indian River and off-shore. Depending on current  and size of boats many times only 1 boat at a time can go thru the RR bridge. This all takes time. In my opinion, boaters should have the same amount of time to go under the bridge as the train has to go over the river.

If you keep it closed 45min every hour it will create a dangerous traffic jam at that choke point. which will cause a rush to get under both bridges, increased accidents and injury.  The bridge down 45 minutes of every hour will delay emergency response times to boaters and swimmers- all caused by keeping this bridge down too long.    Martin and St Lucie County Emergency will need to have different boats and staffing for each side of the RR bridge. 

 A new bridge, taller, wider, faster, safer, is mandatory before any high speed trains go flying over our river.  Its terrible that Brightline reneged on their promise to build a new bridge.  What are they waiting for... a major catastrophe.  

We at least need coordination between the two bridges and reasonable amount of time for all parties to use this access point west for the Okeechobee waterway and access to and from the Ocean.   It makes no sense that there will be no local staffing bridge tenders for the RR bridge.  The Coast Guard should demand full time staffing for a bridge tender so to avoid and prevent problems that cost lives.

The Okeechobee Waterway is a popular and heavily used waterway for recreation, but it is also used for commercial navigation, including tug/barge combinations and commercial fishing vessels. Based on the 2002 Inland Navigation Economic Evaluation, the waterway serves over 6.6 million visitors and generates over $55 million annually. Should access to this waterway be crimped or lost it would result in a $22.7 million annual loss to the surrounding economy according to a recent Corp of Engineers' study.

This bridge crosses the Okeechobee Waterway, a major navigable waterway and isn't the federal government required to maintain the waterway?.  Besides normal traffic, when the hurricanes are approaching boaters from the east will move their boats to safer spots to the west or find a 'hurricane hole' around the river. Visa versa when the boaters from the Gulf need to move their boats out of hurricane territory.  We often see many boats coming east assumably from Naples/Marco area when they are moving their boats north for the summer and then again when moving them south for the winter. The Okeechobee Waterway is a major east/west navigable waterway which will get all jammed up if the RR bridge remains unattended and is only open 15 minutes an hour.  This is a MAJOR safety issue.

Work along the Okeechobee Waterway and in the rivers is always going on.  We see tug boats and several barges every week traveling the river. Limiting access due to the RR bridge will increase those costs significantly and what a nightmare it will be for the tugs and barges to time their day around the RR bridge.

This is an unconscionable situation and so clearly will cause loss of life and damage to the rivers.   Please do not let the RR's federal powers supersede the Corps of Engineers' and the Coast Guards' federal responsibilities to the people and the environment.",,,,,,,

“That train can stop and wait, since they don’t come close to generating the tax dollars that tens of thousands of homes generate”

I don’t care so much about the boat access, as I just have a little party barge, but I won’t lie and say that we’re not concerned about property values and increasing taxes.
The other concern for larger vessels is…..you can’t get into port, during a storm.

To whomever this may concern:

  I and many other boaters of Martin County are very strongly opposed to the proposal of the schedule for the drawbridge as this presents many issues to the community of boaters. For starters, many of the boaters in our area own a boat that does not allow access under the very low clearance train track bridge without the drawbridge in the up position. Proposing a 15 minute interval every hour will prevent all of these boat owners to enjoy their relaxing day on the beautiful waters of Martin County. Practically every boat owner that relies on the access of the drawbridge is a normal, working class citizen that works hard all week and looks forward to a weekend of boating, myself included. This is a major turn off to the boaters in our area and will prevent many people from having a joyful experience on the water. The proposed schedule also conflicts vessels that are passing through to the west coast, through lake Okeechobee. The Okeechobee waterway is a vital and absolutely essential passage way to the west coast and Gulf of Mexico, much like the Panama Canal to the freight ships on the ocean. With this waterway only allowing limited access, it will cause many boaters time, effort and money and practically be forced to seek longer routes to access the waters of the Gulf. The proposed schedule also conflicts emergency response time to vessels in distress, which is absolutely vital to public safety. If access is restricted, emergency response would be non existent if an issue arises where the drawbridge conflicts the emergency. Public safety is the most important thing a local government can provide and hindering that can and will result in lives to be lost. I sincerely hope these reasons listed above will constitute a change in the schedule that works for everyone’s best interest.  ",,,,,,,

I've been stuck there when they held it for two trains sat there with at least thirty boats for over an hour. how do we know what time the bridge is going down? is it on a set schedule? are all of us boaters at the whim of a private company?

Back to my comment of the backup as soon as that bridge opens it's a race to see who can get through first. This is a major accident waiting to happen. I've already been told by several boaters that if they even see the bridge going down that their going to bypass and disregard the no wake zone causing more chance of injury or death. Not to mention the damage to boats at the marina and injury to the Manatee. 15 minuets per hour is not fair to boaters of Martin County our property values will defiantly go down decreasing the tax base.

I absolutely DO NOT support a USCG schedule.

15 minutes an hour is excessively low and restrictive to free navigation of this busy waterway.

And there will many minutes per hour that the train bridge will not be in use.

It is the year 2022. All train bridges should have been moved inland or rebuilt to allow free passage at least half a century ago. Having these 100+ year old structures looming collapse at the next hurricane and blocking free passage is absurdity.

NO FURTHER RESTRICTIONS to navigable waters is acceptable.

Furthermore, the USCG, much like the US Army Corp of Engineers should NOT have such authority, since they obviously exercise minimum or no oversight; and do not represent the citizens their omnipotent decisions affect.

§ 117.317 Okeechobee Waterway.
(c) Florida East Coast Railroad bridge, mile 7.4 at Stuart. The draw shall operate as follows:
(3) When a train approaches the bridge, the navigation lights go to flashing red and a horn sounds four blasts, pauses, and then repeats four blasts. After an eight minute delay, the draw lowers and locks, providing the scanning equipment reveals nothing under the draw. The draw remains down for a period of eight minutes or while the approach track circuit is occupied.

8 minutes (first delay) + 4 minutes (bridge lowering) + 8 minutes = 20 minutes (before the train even enters the approach track—that trek takes approximately 10 minutes). Consequently, a single train passage consumes nearly 30 minutes before the train physically crosses the bridge. On average, a train passage takes 10-15 minutes. Then raising the bridge, which takes 4+ minutes. In summary, that’s 8+4+8+10+15+4 = 49 minutes for ONE TRAIN PASSAGE.",,,,,,,

My name is John Malanchuk and I reside at 2708 NW Howard Creek Lane, Stuart, FL 34994 which is west of the FEC RR bridge on the North fork of the St Lucie River.  I fish frequently so I am on the river almost every single day weather permitting and transit this area frequently. 
2.  I transit under the bridge several times each week. 
3. Delays seem excessive as the rr bridge goes down at least several minutes before and several minutes after a train passes by.  I would estimate a typical delay is 20-30  minutes.  I suppose this stems from a concern for safety.
4.  If safety is an overriding concern then there should be great concern about the number of boats that congregate on either side of the bridge while boaters are waiting for the bridge to be raised.  There can be 6 or more boats on either side waiting to pass.  These are large boats, the area is small the tides can be quite severe here and it is an ""accident waiting to happen.""  
 5.  The challenges are the number and size of the boats, the tides and the limited available space to navigate as well as the limited amount of time available for transiting the area. 
6.  Two intervals of 15 minutes when the rr bridge is raised would be workable.  One interval of fifteen minutes every hour is completely insufficient.  Two intervals of 10 minutes might be satisfactory.
7.The schedules of the rr bridge and the Dixie Highway drawbridge should be coordinated.  Stranding large boats between the rr bridge and the Dixie Highway is a formula for disaster.
Thank you for the opportunity to comment.  If Brightline to Orlando and back is a proven economic success a new rr bridge to completely solve the problem should be built.  If it is not, then curtail the train schedule until it is economical and allow more freedom to boaters west of the rr bridge to pass into the middle estuary east of the bridge.  Any cost-benefit analysis of the success of Brightline should include the impact of property values west of the bridge.

And it stays down for a significant amount of time already.  If you are on your way to one place or another the closed bridge can delay you from anywhere from 5 minutes to 20 minutes.  Right now, the closing is sporadic.  The possible decision of having the bridge be closed 45 minutes every hour is prepsterous to all boaters.  What gives one company the right to totally interfere with every boater on the Treasure Coast?  That would be the Coast Guard.  You.  This decision is no small deal.  It is a big deal.  And I firmly believe the public should have top priority.  I disagree with Brian Mast who is suggesting a 50-50 division of time.  That is giving one company's one vote to the vote of thousands of individual votes.  So, please record my comments as a solid, vehiment opinion that the bridge should be open the majority of the time.",,,,,,,

The Roosevelt bridge used to operate on demand and now it is restricted during the morning and evening rush hours and restricted  to every half hour during the balance of the day.  Restricting it to only 15 minutes per hour would lead to congestion and accidents as boats try to get through.  This bridge is part of the okeechobee waterway and I am not aware of any bridge in that system or the ICW that is restricted to only 15 minutes per hour.   The railroad bridge looks like it is ready to fall apart.  With that much train traffic it will need to be closed for major repairs again affecting boating. Pls redirect bright line trains inland and not across this bridge.  Bright line trains are ruining all the small coastal towns.  Plus how many people are going to die given 80 mile an hour trains.

What are the long term plans for replacing this bridge? Lets not forget these are high speed trains.  The current safety record of Brightline is another concern.

(1) Do you currently transit through the FEC Railroad Bridge crossing the Okeechobee Waterway, mile 7.4, at Stuart, Florida?
Yes, I regularly travel through this crossing.

(2) How often do you transit this waterway?
Weekly. several times.

(3) If railway traffic impedes your navigation of this area, how long are you normally delayed?
Not a big deal currently.  5-10 minutes is normal.

(4) How would you propose to regulate the balance of railway and maritime traffic in this area?
Boaters should not suffer from this new idea. Keep to the current schedule. How about building a new bridge first and then start the service. The rail-line was not intended for the service intervals and train capacity of this nature. You can't move the water but you can move the train tracks.  I can't understand how this is just OK for the amount of service they are intending. Brightline is supported by Federal grants at the expense of the taxpayers. I'm not in favor of using my tax dollars to negatively impact my lifestyle. 

(5) What challenges have you experienced when transiting this area due to these bridges and/or railway activity?
Short delays are nothing unusual but its also not the norm either. The narrowness of space in this area is a huge concern. If a large vessel is coming through, you have to maneuvere out and away from the area. It's One-way traffic for large vessels. The current is also an issue. trying to keep space between you and other boaters while waiting is a daunting task. Weekend traffic is very heavy and changing the opening schedule will only increase the amount of traffic and congestion. There will be more accidents. Boats don't have brakes and can't just sit still in one spot while waiting for the bridge to open.

(6) At what frequency and duration should the drawbridge openings occur in order to meet the needs of navigation?

This is a terrible question. The boaters have been using this crossing for-ever. This is Brightline's problem, not a boating problem.
My boat has a T-Top and will not fit under the bridge. My wife and I moved here to enjoy the water. The amount of traffic is always changing at different times
of the year. Weekends schedules must allow for the max boater use. This is a boating community and has been forever. The change is on Brightline not the citizens. 45 minutes out of every hour for boat traffic would be sufficient leaving 15 minutes for train traffic.

(7) Should the SR 707 (Dixie Hwy) Bridge opening schedule mirror the operating schedule of the FEC Railroad Bridge?

Nothing should change with the Dixie Hwy Bridge.

I grew up in Martin County where the waterways are an important part of the life style we live. 
My husband and I chose to live in North River Shores because of the access to the water and the property values within our neighborhood.  
The railroad bridge crosses the only waterway passage to access the Intercostal  and St. Lucie Inlet from our neighborhood. The residents in Palm City and St. Lucie county use the passage as well. 
Just within the past month, our family has experienced several long wait times (45minutes and longer)during the weekends at the railroad bridge.  Not only was the wait time a problem, but 30-40 boats, all of different lengths and widths, became an issue. The wind and the current were not in our favor on this day either. One boater became upset because he felt we were trying to “cut” in front of him and began yelling, “Stay in line!!!!!” We were simply trying to turn our vessel away from the of the pile up of boats that was staring to occur. Even Seatow, who was in tow, had issues navigating. 
I hate to imagine the outcome with the proposed schedule of the railroad bridge. This is going to become a VERY dangerous area for All boaters. 
There are many factors to consider why the new proposed railroad schedule will make this area challenging! 
A new marina is being built in this small congested area, which will add to volume of boaters. Not to mention the channel and shallow oyster beds within this small area that all boaters must navigate through. This area is a no wake zone, and we have witnessed “plowing” ( term used for creating a large wake)by boaters to make it through the railroad bridge before it closes. DANGEROUS!!!!! 
The narrow passage allows for only one large vessel at a time. Which means smaller boats must give right away to.
One of the three basic roles of the Coast Guard is safety. 
This area in Martin County regarding the railroad bridge and Brightline, is becoming a safety issue for the boating community. 
This proposal will damage our way of the life, the safety of all boaters, and the property values on the westside of the railroad bridge.
Brightline has already made a negative impact on our community, and the train hasn’t even begun to run through our towns.  Don’t allow them to destroy and take away our freedom of boating too.  Happy and SAFE boating!!

1- Safety of the community weather it be residents or visitors if there are emergencies on the waterway and the coast guard can not get access due to the bridge being shut in the down position- This could honestly be the difference between life and death.

2- To disrupt a waterway community in several ways such as violating water way rights - Deflating property values - and congesting our water way at this choke point will have an adverse effect on the community and tourism in general. 

3- For this train to not bring any benefits to our community and only have a negative effect this should not be considered. The bridge should be rebuilt as they are doing in Jupiter - This will cost substantial money but the cost to our community will be greater. At a minimum the times should be reversed and the bridge closed for 15 min and open for 45.

Real estate values are tied to water access and ease of use. The bridge being closed is a major impediment and can often times be a 30 minute delay going out through the 7.4 Railway Stuart bridge.

The homeowners and boaters who live in the area should be prioritized and if there needs to be a 15 minute closure every hour for trains to run that would be the best option to allow 45 minutes of boating access. There should never be more than a 15 minute delay for boaters to transit under the rail Bridge. The amount of pollution and wasted fuel for boats idling for 30 or 45 minutes waiting for the bridge would be a disaster for the environment and potentially some boats may run out of fuel waiting for the rail bridge to go up. If this were to change then boating families will no longer consider living in Port St. Lucie or Palm city as a viable option. This also becomes a safety concern as some boaters are not comfortable navigating after dark and sitting for 30 to 45 minutes may mean the difference between boating with or without daylight. It also may be a concern for families with children and especially in boats that do not have restroom facilities to be stuck for 30 to 45 minutes waiting on the bridge with a child or elderly passenger that cannot wait to use the restroom. The best option is to limit the closure of the bridge to never more than 15 minutes and also to potentially elevate the bridge so that this is not a concern. Personally, I never would have bought a home in Palm city on the water if I knew that this would be a potential problem. Thanks for your consideration.",,,,,,,

I agree with all the comments regarding closing the bridge 45 minutes out of every hour for all the obvious reasons. I do not need to rehash them. The Coast Guard is fully aware what happens when a bridge is down and vessels are forced to wait with strong currents. I personally have experienced delays going out and coming back in with a half hour wait on either side. 

Currently the closures have been 20-30 minutes and it creates havoc on the water with backups.  See Photo. The Bridge should be OPEN 45 mins. an hour and on a schedule so boaters know the times. The backups that occur from the closure takes just as long to clear it. Less closures on weekends would also help with the flow of boaters passing through.

The drawbridge is not timed with the train bridge causing boats to get stuck in between the two with no way out and strong currents. The two bridges should always be open at the same time. See Photo.

We chose to live here and enjoy the water and access to it way before Briteline decided to take over control of the train bridge. If I were to move in to a neighborhood where an airport resides, would I be able to ask them to stop flying their planes over my house? 

We were here first. Briteline should not be able to disrupt the quality of life for tax paying Americans just trying to enjoy a few hours of relaxation. They should find another alternative not us!

My family and I are avid boaters and utilize this waterway every weekend at a minimum. It offers us access to downtown Stuart to support local businesses, the intracoastal and other recreational areas the area has to offer. The proposed plan of cutting off this artery is not an acceptable solution. We were all provided plans for a new bridge to be erected that would allow 18 feet of clearance in the ""down"" position to allow most boat traffic to flow regardless of train activity above. https://www.tcpalm.com/story/sports/fishing-boating/2019/10/30/brightline-virgin-trains-to-replace-stuart-railroad-bridge/2498418001/
It seems this is a classic example of bait and switch as now the boaters are forced to deal with the plan changes. Area residents, boaters visitors and anyone else who passes through this area are not responsible for making time and safety concessions for the sake of a rail road that is not popular in the area to begin with. As the others have said this 15 minute boat traffic window will transfer this traditionally easy passage to an all-out free for all. There will be collisions between vessels, bridges, property damage from large wakes and most likely and unfortunate loss of life. This passage is already narrow and usually allows the passage of one vessel at a time. For the period of time the drawbridge is opened that means NW Dixie Highway will have to be in the up position as well creating traffic backups that are likely to stretch into downtown Stuart. Has this been analyzed and studied for public safety? The other issue with this plan is the flow of barges and tugs passing through the Okeechobee waterway. What is the plan for them? They get priority during the open time and then there is no time for recreational boaters? What studies have been gathered related to the boating traffic that will be impacted? Safety studies? Environmental impacts (Manatees etc.) I'm also perplexed at why waterway travel can be closed for 45 minutes an hour. Will the surrounding roads with rail crossings be closed for 45 minutes every hour as well for Brightline? If not why? Why is vehicle traffic allowed to flow and the other is not. Especially when one mode of transportation has only one narrow path allowing navigation. Both have rights to traverse their respective area without encumbrances. Per Florida Statue 361.025 railroad companies do not have eminent domain for ""securing facilities on ANY WATERS of this state, including land for such facilities (bridge would fall into this category) shall be subordinate to the right of the governmental entity..."" I trust the government in this case will do the right thing and protect the rights and freedom of the majority and not the minority of train passengers passing through to aid a private business grow. This is a case of eminent domain as blocking access of a navigable waterway would give the railway control of public property.

As a resident of the Treasure Coast who purchased a waterfront river property, on the condition that there were no fixed bridges to the ocean, I'm concerned that these changes will decrease our property values.  This area builds back-up traffic very quickly when the bridge is down and creates a hazardous environment for boaters to navigate; this proposal will dramatically increase the chances of accidents here.  It will also impede potential rescue traffic.  In addition, the longer boats are idling here, the more pollution gathers in the water in concentrated amounts.  Brightline isn't even offering a stop in our city, but expects our residents to sacrifice for their profit with no benefit to us.  I strongly oppose this plan.  In addition, this is a pivot from what Brightline originally promised.  There would have been much more opposition originally if they had not promised to raise that bridge, thus allowing for a lessened impact to the people that actually live here.  It would be beyond disappointing to see yet another decision made that supports corporate interests over the interests of our residents.

I also own a marine-related business and regularly move boats through this area.

(2) How often do you transit this waterway? - Generally 4-6 times per week.

(3) If railway traffic impedes your navigation of this area, how long are you normally delayed? - I have been delayed for as long as 1.5 hours waiting on freight trains to clear the bridge.  It is particularly problematic early in the morning when the FEC will lower the bridge and keep it down for multiple trains to cross the river, regardless of the time between trains.  I have the phone number for the FEC dispatch office and will often call them to complain about the extended closing.  There have been mornings when there have been 8-10 boats waiting to get under the bridge, however, there FEC can care less how long we have to idle and wait for their trains.

(4) How would you propose to regulate the balance of railway and maritime traffic in this area?  The bridge tender on the Dixie Highway bridge should have the ability to raise and lower both bridges as needed.  Alternatively, move both bridges to openings on the hour and half hour and leave the train bridge up when there is no train scheduled  to pass.

(5) What challenges have you experienced when transiting this area due to these bridges and/or railway activity?  Extensive delays, wasted fuel, large number of boats idling in an area where the currents can be very swift and boaters have difficulty managing the current.  The opening of the railway bridge is also very narrow so when large boats are passing through you need to only allow 1 boat at a time.

(6) Is a 15 minute hourly opening schedule sufficient for marine traffic? If not, please explain why. - No, not at all, mainly due to the congestion it will cause with boats queuing up for 45 minutes.  A minimum of 30 minutes should be required, preferably on a schedule of the hour and half hour, thus allowing boaters to plan their trips accordingly.  If the FEC would raise the bridge to the height of the Dixie Hwy bridge this would become much less of an issue.

(7) Should the SR 707 (Dixie Hwy) Bridge opening schedule mirror the operating schedule of the FEC Railroad Bridge? - Yes, although for smaller boats that can pass under the bridge this is less of an issue.",,,,,,,

It will not be a stretch of one’s imagination to see the increased dangers caused as everyone rushes to the open channel from both sides. 2 large vessels will have a difficult task especially with smaller boats swarming around them. There is a reason that the Coast Guard has established the opening time for the highway bridge (large # of vessels on the western side trying to leave the river). Anything less for the railroad bridge will prove to be dangerous and will result in many accidents. One has to understand the almost every vessel will be waiting for the opening. Imagine the pollution caused by motorized vessels waiting hours to get through.

The fact that the USCG is asking these questions is troubling at many levels. I though they were to keep our waterways navigable and safe. The negative impact of long periods of the RR Bridge being closed is unsafe to all boaters, unsafe in an emergency, a direct attack on all businesses on both sides of the bridge and hugely unfair to all boating residents. 
The following comments are in response to your request for feedback to the following questions:

(1) Do you currently transit through the FEC Railroad Bridge crossing the Okeechobee Waterway, mile 7.4, at Stuart, Florida? Yes, I frequently transit the RR Bridge in a boat that requires 20 ft height clearance, which at this RR Bridge requires an opening.

(2) How often do you transit this waterway? 8-10 times per month at least

(3) If railway traffic impedes your navigation of this area, how long are you normally delayed? This bridge is rarely in the down position for train traffic. If their is a delay it is about 20 minutes. A 20 minute delay causes a ripple effect of delays for bridge closings elsewhere, marina closings, lock closings, reservations and appointments.

(4) How would you propose to regulate the balance of railway and maritime traffic in this area? I strongly believe that boat traffic should have priority over rain traffic. The best way to address this issue would be to build a new bridge with sufficient height clearance to accommodate most boat traffic. Because hat is unlikely my suggestion would be 25% of each hour closed for train traffic and 75% open for boat traffic. 

(5) What challenges have you experienced when transiting this area due to these bridges and/or railway activity? Any time yoiu are delayed by a bridge closing, there are cascading challenges (see comment #3 above)

(6) Is a 15 minute hourly opening schedule sufficient for marine traffic? If not, please explain why. Absolutely not!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! That is almost impossible to plan for while boating. That would be horribly insufficient and can't even believe the USCG is asking such a question.

(7) Should the SR 707 (Dixie Hwy) Bridge opening schedule mirror the operating schedule of the FEC Railroad Bridge? The railroad bridge is so low that it makes no difference. If the RR bridge is closed, it doesn't matter is the next bridge is open.",,,,,,,

Yes it’s going to cost you extra money in the beginning with running the extra track but it won’t have the overhead of running the water way. Don’t forget that this is the main waterway that runs across the coast which the navy did around one of the world wars which means big boats come through here.  More importantly for your bridge, barges come through here all the time and there have been so many destroyed bulkheads it’s ridiculous and to think that your going to run a fast train with a lot of g-force through it is crazy because it won’t last. Lastly,to finalize it, run it west and add a train stop just like the turn pike did. This area from palm city north to ft.

With the rail bridge in the down position for the proposed time 75% of the time you will create a log jam of floating vessels on both sides of the bridge. This in itself is dangerous to have many boats and captains with varying degrees of expertise on top of each other waiting for another train to pass. Then when it does raise you have boats entering the channel in both ways creating significant wakes and a recipe for collisions resulting in injuries and/or deaths. So you are now placing smaller boats in harms way of 45'+ yachts as they access east and west bound through the narrow railway bridge and the Old Roosevelt bridge.  There is no equity in keeping the bridge down solely based on the introduction of additional passenger trains.  Boaters access must be include and their safety.  The current railway bridge was never built and managed to provide the proposed access either rebuild it or leave things as they are. 

1) Do you currently transit through the FEC Railroad Bridge crossing the Okeechobee Waterway, mile 7.4, at Stuart, Florida? Yes

(2) How often do you transit this waterway? 2-3 times a week

(3) If railway traffic impedes your navigation of this area, how long are you normally delayed? 15-20 minutes

(4) How would you propose to regulate the balance of railway and maritime traffic in this area? Build new railway bridge to accommodate new requirements

(5) What challenges have you experienced when transiting this area due to these bridges and/or railway activity? Trying to avoid inexperienced boaters traveling through the channel.  Can not imagine what it would be like with increased delays and additional boat/boaters trying to naviagate all at the same time and it both directions.

(6) Is a 15 minute hourly opening schedule sufficient for marine traffic? If not, please explain why. Volume of boats and safety concerns e.g. inexperienced boaters and a narrow channel.

(7) Should the SR 707 (Dixie Hwy) Bridge opening schedule mirror the operating schedule of the FEC Railroad Bridge? No other way around.

Having lived in Ft. Lauderdale, West Palm Beach,, New Smyrna Beach, and now retired to Stuart.   Over the last 3 years here we have not had much issue with the RR bridge so it was not really a big concern.  With the introduction of Brightline we knew the bridge would be down more but never imagined that it would be so disproportionately applied as the current proposal recommends.  It appears that the lifestyle of the boating public which draws so many of us to this area is of no concern.  Well there are other important things to consider

Safety - My  experience with the delays and backup of boating traffic over the last 30 days gives us a unique perspective over someone who is not intimately involved in trying to  navigate these waters and gives us a clear understanding as to the potential dangerous situation that extended bridge closures produce.  On all seven  (7) occasions we have gone out in the our vessel over the last 30 days we have been detained by the Railroad bridge six (6) times varying from 15 minutes to 50 minutes.   For the longer delays the number of vessels awaiting transit has been over 60 boats and with the wind/ current/ small path it is a difficult task at times to get two way traffic through.  This combined with the lack of boating courtesy we have seen makes for a volatile situation.  New arrivals to the que passing those who have been waiting patiently and going to the front of the line not only agitates those who have been waiting but increases the navigation hazard of all who are jockeying with the wind/ current/ other vessels.

Need for Law Enforcement: If anything less than 30 min. open is approved then the USCG would need to post law enforcement at the East side of the bridge during high traffic times in order to mitigate this issue.  It’s just a matter of time before someone gets injured or killed all due to policy making by USCG.

Weather:  The above scenario is magnified on high traffic days when the weather turns and a mass exodus along the waterways is experienced.  By having extended down times this places the boating public at unnecessary risk and magnifies the potential for irrational behavior due to fear of the weather.

West bound Large vessel hazards: Due to the lack of bridge opening coordination you will see West bound vessels trying to get past the RR bridge and que in between it and the N Dixie Hwy. (NDHB)  bridge so as to make sure they can continue on once the NDHB opens.  This is not only a hazard to them but also all other boating traffic since the space is very confined.

Traffic volume:  15 min/hr is woefully inadequate to handle the traffic demands especially on weekends & Holidays.  As stated above the boating traffic is significant and can’t get everyone through safely in a 15 minute period.

Coordination with N. Dixie Hwy Bridge: No matter what is decided the bridges should be coordinated so that the  N. Dixie Hwy. bridge can open on demand if the RR bridge is open.  This will minimize the number of larger vessels backing up and alleviate some of the pressure on navigating the RR bridges hazardous conditions.


Right now captains have no control over their ability to schedule trips so by posting closure times for the RR bridge it will help with planning and inturn diminish the anxiety for all those trying to enjoy this beautiful boating community.

It would be advantageous and safer for the train bridge to operate on a known closing schedule--being opened at all other times-- and even more effective if the train bridge had a live tender that was communicating in real time with train operators. The limited time proposed would be impede any and all safe boating operations happening and would essentially put many out of business or cause relocation as a necessity, as well as put recreational boaters at major risk. This bridge is one way, the currents are strong, there are many boaters, and there are two bridges to deal with; therefore, it is an absolute necessity for the Coast Guard to come up with a well thought out solution to this already incredibly risky situation. It is obvious that the train bridge needs to be replaced as well; given its obvious poor condition creating a safety hazard.

To begin, the  45 to 15 minute ratio will negatively impact recreational, commercial, law enforcement, tow boats and any other vessel that operates in this area.  The long closure time will create a traffic jam during the small window of time that the drawbridge is open for - we will see boaters rushing through the tiny opening in a high current area which will cause accidents, arguments.  In addition, what is law enforcement or tow boats going to when they need to urgently pass through? 

In addition to this, there are numerous businesses on the west side of the bridge such as sunset bay, sailors return, meredian marina, river watch marina, marinemax that will see a negative impact to their business due to this drawbridge schedule.  

Lastly, every home on the west side of the bridge will see a decrease in it's value. 

The bridge needs to remain open for AT LEAST thirty minutes of each hour in order to be fair to boaters, homeowners and businesses that operate in Stuart, Palm City and Port St Lucie.

Not only does this waterway serve recreational boaters, it is also the only route through the state and an emergency evacuation route. At a minimum, the railroad bridge should be open half the time and perhaps more than half during the morning and late afternoon hours.  This is going to be a very dangerous situation especially at a time change .  I certainly hope this decision changes and they decide to keep our waterway safe.

1.
If someone requires emergency services west  of the bridge and the bridge is down.

2.  The area under the railroad bridge for navigation is very narrow, boats attempting to travel in both directions in a short amount of 
time will create an extremely dangerous situation  in that narrow channel. 
It will be every man for himself and there will be accidents.
Please consider the safety of our community as the priority and lift the railroad bridge high enough so most recreational vessels can pass, please make the channel much wider in the new design. 

3.  If all the recreational boaters west of the bridge trailer their boats around  this impasse, the boat ramps, which are already overcrowded, will be impossible.

This hair-brained scheme with impact thousands of boaters limiting access to recreational areas, restaurants accessed by boats, and likely cause business to the east of the bridge to close due to the negative economic impact!  And for what?  So a subsidized rail system can get a handful of folks south of us to Disney quicker?  I answered your prescribed questions below, but those answers do not come close to articulating how disruptive this idiotic plan will be 

(1) Do you currently transit through the FEC Railroad Bridge crossing the Okeechobee Waterway, mile 7.4, at Stuart, Florida?
      Yes, my family and transit through the referenced bridge at least twice per week

(2) How often do you transit this waterway?
     At least twice per week.  Our home is west of the bridge and we must travel this route to get to recreational areas and restaurants 

(3) If railway traffic impedes your navigation of this area, how long are you normally delayed?
     We are typically delayed from 30 to 45 minutes and then the transit is very hazardous (especially on weekends) due to the buildup of traffic on both sides of the bridge coupled with the narrow passage beneath the bridge.

(4) How would you propose to regulate the balance of railway and maritime traffic in this area?
     When we were originally informed of the pending passenger rail service, we were promised a new rail bridge that would not impeded boat traffic and now it appears that turned out to a false promise.  My view is there is no benefit to the local community from passenger rail service.  Not only will boat traffic be severely impacted, the downtown Stuart corridor will be a disaster.  Passenger rail service, if it is to come to fruition, should do no harm to our existing way of life. Perhaps the investor should build a rail line west of town as an alternative

(5) What challenges have you experienced when transiting this area due to these bridges and/or railway activity?
     When the bridge is closed or only open for short durations it creates a VERY dangerous situation with dozens of boats of all sizes trying to navigate the narrow passage beneath the bridge in a very short time frame.  The proposal to only allow passage 15-minutes each hour is a disaster waiting to happen!  Whomever allows this travesty will surely have injuries, or worse on their hands.  How can this even be considered with a clear conscience?

(6) At what frequency and duration should the drawbridge openings occur in order to meet the needs of navigation?
     The bridge should not be closed more than 30 minutes in any 60-minute period and frankly, that is generous!

(7) Should the SR 707 (Dixie Hwy) Bridge opening schedule mirror the operating schedule of the FEC Railroad Bridge?
     This question is not material to the rail bridge question because there are alternate routes vehicles impacted by the SR 707 bridge openings can take

Brightline is attempting to make this a fixed bridge 75% of the time in order for them to save money on construction costs.

This bridge has a history of getting stuck and also falling on boats, not to mention it is too low for hurricanes, flooding and sea rise in the future. Because of the basic safety issues already caused by this bridge, owners of the tracks should be mandated to replace it if they are going to extend its use.

Maritime traffic would grow exponentially. The river serves as a primary means of traversing the state nautically without navigating south around the entire state of Florida. Corrolary, it serves as the only point of egress to open waters from the North and South Fork Rivers. This will compound traffic landside as boaters who would typically utilize launching ramps will gravitate more only to those that lie on the seaward side of the bridge, thereby overflowing existing infrastructure.
More boating and vehicle accidents are likely to occur as are risks to the general public who live near these waters. It is unreasonable to accommodate a business venture because it wants less restrictions at such a great cost to an entire county and the communities it serves.",,,,,,,

The larger boats have to wait for the drawbridge which opens every 30 minutes during the week and every 20 minutes on weekends.  On good boating days, there are several boats that wait and circle in a small area with a strong current just for the drawbridge.  While the larger boats are waiting many, many smaller boats go through the railroad opening and under the drawbridge.  The smaller boats will not fit under the railroad bridge, so if they have to wait along with the bigger boats in a confined area with currents, there will be chaos.  And that's with an opening every 20 or 30 minutes.  The railroad bridge should be open every time the drawbridge is open as well as a regular schedule that leaves it open at least 30 minutes every hour.  Any other option would put boaters at risk.  The USCG should always support safe boating and not put boaters at risk in favor of a corporate interests.

It blocks all traffic and stacks the boats up waiting in fast moving current trying to hold position while more boats keep adding up trying to do the same. These are not cars on pavement. There is also an major issue when squals and lightning blow up out of the blue and small vessels can't get to safety.
The bridge very old and needs to be upgraded  as it stands and 45 minute waits is out of the question for to many reasons.
Briteline should have included this in the begining. They have the technology to make the bridge open only when necessary.  They need to fix the issue using thir money.",,,,,,,

Many years ago I reported to Group Miami of the FEC's keeping the Stuart railroad bridge (in this Proposed Rule) down for multiple trains before raising it. The agreed-upon schedule between the two groups was not being upheld by FEC and boaters were made to wait 90 minutes or more between openings with no prior notice or schedule for proper navigation planning transiting this area. The Old Roosevelt Bridge-tender had (has?) no method of notification from FEC other than when the horn sounds and the railroad bridge descends. Group Miami had not been aware of this deviation and acted immediately to address. I refer to this prior practice as an example of the detail which must be included in any Proposed Rule to prevent similar schedule deviations because ""it's a train"" with its limited ability to maneuver! 

A second observation of more recent operational issues are the times when the bridge is scheduled to go up versus when it actually does. I have delivered vessels up and down the ICW from Miami to Bar Harbor, ME and most bridge tenders are watching for vessel traffic and coordinating the opening to the vessel's arrival so there is no need to slow more than appropriate for the transit through. This particular bridge however has a widely varying schedule depending on who is the particular bridge tender that day. Some operators open as expected and on time and others don't even try to put down the highway gates until 3-7 minutes past the scheduled opening time... do they need to set their watches or is there a master clock present? This is important as the larger vessels count on respectable schedule keeping for efficient navigation.

The home port for my 40' cruiser is just west of these bridges and consequently I must transit through them anytime we want to reach any useful waters for boating (going west towards Lake O is a rare destination). We pass these bridges about 3-5 times per month (never on holidays due to the number of inexperienced boaters clogging the waterways). When waiting for the bridge to open I experience other vessels waiting also. On the east side of the bridges, vessels lose room to maneuver against the current as more vessels approach. A large vessel can be the first to arrive, and then soon after be surrounded by many smaller vessels thus restricting the larger vessel's ability to maneuver the sometimes significant current and wind to avoid collision. At times there will be many vessels on the east side returning to their home ports and slightly fewer vessels waiting on the west side leaving for distant destinations eastward (as this is the ICW). Vessels waiting are either larger yachts or sportfish vessels too tall to transit without an opening. Most vessels who can simply lower their antennas generally do so, but virtually no vessels can go beneath the railroad bridge when it's down. 

Once the drawbridge opens, most of the waiting vessels start moving towards the bridge immediately. Personally I go on Channel 9 and recognize any current present and suggesting downriver vessels transit first. Usually all the larger vessels agree and transit is easy. However, many smaller boats don't monitor their radio at all and just go when the bridge opens, regardless of direction. At this time the channel between both drawbridges become very congested and many times too dangerous to proceed. Wide vessels such as and not limited to catamarans are commonly using this waterway and meeting them in this area becomes difficult to navigate. 

> I strongly feel bringing the schedule for openings less than the current schedule will cause more unsafe congestion, possibly leading to collisions between boats or structures.
> I also believe that there needs to be a digital sign on each side of the railroad bridge: ""Next closing in XXX minutes"". A key to alleviating boater issues is communication in real time of events happening currently to cause the bridge to not open on schedule. Perhaps a general marine broadcast on VHF Channel 13 (commercial traffic usually) every 15 minutes with notices of ""Emergency Vehicle Traffic"" (ambulances, police, etc), FEC deviations, etc., would help increase the patience level of vessel operators.
> Each time the railroad bridge has been down longer than 15 minutes the Old Roosevelt Bridge should open within a few minutes of when the railroad bridge reopens if the next opening is longer than 20 minutes additional wait.

It sank and the insurance company had to total the boat.  This is only lost property.

Other than the fact that marine traffic has the right of way, Brightline has reneged on all of it's mitigating promises. when they lower the railroad bridge it is done automatically by computer way before the train gets to the area and then waits for 10-15 minutes after the train passes by. They promised a live bridge operator who would mitigate these prolonged computerized times. I pass under the bridge at least weekly to go fishing and enjoy my day boating. It takes 30-45 minutes for this computerized process for 1 train. with current cargo trains and future brightline trains, it is mathematically impossible for all the trains to get through in 24 hours and still allow boaters to get through. Currently, when the bridge is lowered, marine traffic backs up waiting to get through. at current speed limits of minimal wake (5 mph) and spacing to prevent accidents it would sometimes be impossible to get all boats through (in both directions) within the proposed 15 minute window requiring another 45 minute wait for marine traffic. Again, if Brightline were to have a manned bridge station, this could be mitigated. Currently, only one track is planned for this bridge with 2 way traffic, necessitating a holding pattern for 1 of 2 possible trains.This would actually result in a longer transit time for 2 trains that just 45 minutes. A study showing how long it actually takes a train to transit the bridge both at current speeds and at brightline speeds should be able to produce the actual needed time for the bridge to be raised. Brightline has also reneged on its promise to elevate the bridge to allow smaller boats to pass under as they do on the adjacent automobile traffic bridge.  It seems that brightline wants the government to do everything for it while it doesn't have to spend any extra money. This is a huge burden to those of us who pay taxes in this area and who elect public officials in this area and in Tallahassee. I urge the government to consider the rights of it's citizens in this project. If Brightline elevates the bridge and places a live operator on the bridge they could mitigate the damages done to local residents.  ",,,,,,,

I pulled in to the PO, dropped my mail into the box, then immediately returned the same way, over the Draw Bridge.  Would you believe the Bridge was opened AGAIN to let Boaters thru? That was a total of TWO OPENINGS   within the time I went South & then returned over the bridge again going North.  That was TWO OPENINGS for boaters within a matter of less than 10 minutes!!  WHY do boaters get preference over vehicles?  Their leisure vehicles get preference over people who live here, people who work here, people who may have an Emergency.  Why is that Fair?  I personally think we should either have a specific schedule of Bridge Openings -OR - at the very least, a sign stating that the bridge is open, so that cars in a hurry can make a decision further N. to use the Roosevelt Bridge instead of the Draw Bridge.  Shouldn’t the people who live here be given some consideration over the people in the water in leisure vehicles??

The planned restrictive time window for allowing sea vessels to pass also poses a grave concern to safety as this will induce a crowding of vessels and also even more important, those that try to escape the ravages of dangerous and devastating storms, especially during the summer, where boaters can and DO become trapped in these storms and must speed to seek shelter for safety. You know this is true! You are our precious Coast Guard and you are the ones who answer the calls to help those in need. You are aware of the critical importance of maintaining patency of our waterways at all times. Brightline should have been more thorough in their planning but did not care. They needed to build a high bridge for their trains to pass over without blocking boat traffic. You must throw this back into the lap of Brightline who does not even have a passenger base that will be using this means of transportation. I would think the CG would help protect activity of our waterways and let corporate worry about how to work around these obstacles. Please do not allow closure of the bridge over the Saint Lucie River. It should only be closed when a train is actually coming. Brightline will have to adjust its schedule accordingly. PLEASE DO NOT CLOSE OUR BRIDGE AND DESTROY OUR PRECIOUS QUALITY OF LIFE IN FLORIDA!!!  Also with the cost of fuel idling will increase the cost of boating. 

I stand as a very very strong supporter of our military and it’s veterans as well as those that have lost their lives to maintain our freedom. By those hands we support please do not take away freedoms of our citizens who so many have died for to secure.

2 - Several times per year
3 - 15-20 minutes
4 - elevate and widen the FEC railroad span to allow smaller boats 24 hour access
5 - FEC railroad bridge is too narrow for two-way traffic. Very difficult for sailboats to idle in place and wait depending on wind and tide.
6 - Ideally to have both SR-707 and FEC railroad bridge open on the hour and half hour upon demand
7 - I assume the decision has already been made to open the SR-707 bridge when the FEC railroad bridge is up once per hour

Getting positive feedback on restrictive marine access from a boating community that receives no benefits from a high speed train that doesn't stop in Stuart is very unlikely. I assume one of the impact studies tracked the boat heights of vessels using the FEC railroad bridge over a weekend. Seems like the best solution is spending more money to widen and raise the FEC bridge to a height that the majority of boats have 24 hour access.

I traverse the Roosevelt / Railroad / 707 drawbridge narrows at least 3 times per week.  The current on demand operation of the railroad bridge for freight trains entails 3 phases, a 5 minute dropping time of the span, a 10 minute wait for the train, and after passage a 5 minute opening of the span.  So for a 10 minute long train, about 30 minutes of bridge blockage is involved for boaters.  During this time many boats of various size and captain skills are in close proximity and  manuevering in tidal currents and wind with little lee for collision avoidance.  For this proposal as written to to allow 15 minutes of passage per hour would require 25 minutes of span opening time, which would also create enormous auto traffic on the 707 roadway to mirror the railroad span opening.  Boaters would learn the schedule, yes, and pile up on both sides in large numbers.  This plan in impossible to successfully implemment.  
The current demand system could continue to work if the faster and shorter Brightline trains just schedule passage as part of the freight openings or, without a freight train get demand passage as needed.  At the very least this would give all stakeholders a chance to get used to the new trains.  Nowhere have I seen an estimate of the number of Brightline crossings per day, but surely the railroad entities can manage the usage of their bridge without the chaos of the scheduled opening scheme in the USCG proposal.
On a final note, this waterway is part of the Intracoastal waterway system, not a convenience for recreational boaters, an should not be blocked by the railroad wanting to overuse an ancient and ineffective bridge.  The effect of this proposal is to give the railroad a free ride across the waterway at the real expense and safety of the users of the waterway.

I don't agree that boaters should have preference in this ruling because they are in a leisure setting while trains running over a drawbridge are on a schedule.  Besides, the Brightline will be traveling so fast over that drawbridge that the boats would take much longer to pass under the drawbridge causing more traffic issues.  Drawbridges that open ""on demand"" are also a major issue for vehicle traffic flow!  I know this because of the 2 drawbridges in Jupiter and 1 in Hobe Sound where I live.  Two are ""on demand"" and the other is on the half hour if needed.  Again, I believe boaters being out for leisure activity should not be given preference.  Leisure activity gives it's own answer...there is not an on demand need for passing thru a drawbridge because they are not on a schedule.  Thanks for listening...Joyce D  Hobe Sound",,,,,,,

The water - and those who use it - have the right-of-way, not trains !!!!

The Coast Guard says that its goal is to provide a “more predictable schedule” for boaters, but we’re worried that “more predictable” is code for “less access.”  For example, forcing boats to use tiny windows of 15 minutes each hour to go under the bridge, while Brightline trains roll through dozens of times per day, is predictable but it’s certainly not equitable.

In my opinion, at a minimum, boaters must have at least as much opportunity to pass as trains.  Anything less is unacceptable. 

We the taxpayers, boaters and Martin County residents must be prioritized over the business & profit goals of Brightline !!!

Please consider this and support our local population - Thank you.",,,,,,,

I use the waterway and pass under the rail road bridge on an irregular basis as I am a recreational boater. At times it could be 6 times a day or 2 times a month. I have been delayed up to 1 hour when the automatic/remote devises that regulate the bridge, kept it close for reasons unknown to myself. I can only assume the train had triggered the closing of the bridge but had stopped.  More often then not, it's more of an inconvenience then a issue for me, since my boat (23' center console) can navigate under the bridge when the tide is on the low side. I only need to assure my VHF antenna is down. 

From an economic premise, recreational boating along with real estate values in the area, are dependent on unchanging conditions for boating. Martin County (where I live) is mostly recreational boating. The ideal situation is to raise the structure to a more 'accommodating height' for boaters. That burden should be on the railroad operators and users, as I see it.  Since the rail road does not pay fuel related taxes, I would like to see some money generated by the rail road to pay for a new and 'more accommodating' bridge over the water way.  ",,,,,,,

Typically the wait time is 15-20 minutes. During that time, especially on weekends there are often many boats backup trying to passage that VERY NARROW channel. When there is any significant wind or current i would not think 15 minutes would be sufficient time to get all the traffic thru. That would mean some vessels would be there for up to two hours!

Actually I can not believe the NTSB will even allow that much train traffic on that bridge at all. It it severely deteriorated and should likely have been reconstructed a LONG time ago. If it were a passenger bridge for Automobiles it would have never passed inspection. 

If the bridge were to be reconstructed even a few feet higher at least 60%-70% of the traffic would be able to get thru with the bridge closed and elevate much of the problem. Additionally as I am sure the train schedules are known well in advance it seems that adjustments could be made for the bridge to be open far more than closed. Only being open the proposed 15 minutes per hour will dramatically effect the value of the homes and businesses located west of the bridge. 

What would be the contingent plan when the bridge has mechanical issues from the new increased traffic? It is old and will have problems. I have worked on bascule bridges of this type and from my experience many of the repairs required would mean the bridge would need to be closed for LONG durations with out being opened at all. As this is a a navigable waterway I can not see how this is acceptable to the Coast Guard at all. ",,,,,,,

URGENT: PROPOSED CHANGES TO ST. LUCIE BRIDGE OPERATIONS IMPACTING BOATERS

Image

Bill and Madeline -

This is URGENT.  Right now, the United States Coast Guard is considering MAJOR changes to how the St. Lucie River railroad bridge operates to accommodate Brightline.  Changes to these regulations will impact the maritime industry, boaters and everyone who enjoys our water.  If these changes move forward, they could drastically restrict how much time boaters are able to pass underneath the bridge. 

As part of the process, the Coast Guard is hosting a public comment period. You can comment here:

SUBMIT A COMMENT
I personally will be submitting a comment outlining my concerns.  I am worried that the Coast Guard will prioritize Brightline over boaters, and that’s not right.  The water - and those who use it - have the right-of-way, not trains.

The Coast Guard says that its goal is to provide a “more predictable schedule” for boaters, but I’m worried that “more predictable” is code for “less access.”  For example, forcing boats to use tiny windows of 15 minutes each hour to go under the bridge, while Brightline trains roll through dozens of times per day, is predictable but it’s certainly not equitable.

In my opinion, at a minimum, boaters must have at least as much opportunity to pass as trains.  Anything less is unacceptable. ",,,,,,,

•Closing this bridge for 45 minutes every hour will reduce the appeal of the Okeechobee Waterway at Stuart, Fl by causing unreasonable delays. It is a heavily transited area that will greatly impact many boaters.
•A schedule such as this reduces the appeal of living upriver of this bridge, forcing potential homeowners interested in boating to look elsewhere. This will essentially devalue all properties upriver of the bridge and almost all of Palm City Florida.
•Massive boat traffic jams will occur, causing a hazard to navigation, accidents and potential injury.
•This schedule will also hurt local businesses such as marinas & restaurants upriver of the bridge, as it will reduce the number of boats interested in transiting the bridge to patronize their facilities. Ultimately, this will cause a loss of jobs in the area.
•What is the potential environmental impact to marine life by creating massive traffic jams on the water waiting for a bridge to open only 15 minutes of every hour?",,,,,,,

I feel that the bridge impedes 90% of boaters who attempt to pass through it when the bridge is down. Very few boats can pass beneath it.  It is already a safety hazard for boaters.  While the bridge is down.  Many boats begin to stack up and wait for it to open again.  The current in this area is extremely swift. boats will move around and some captains become in patient.  When the bridge opens, many boats of all sizes and many captains of varied skill levels will attempt to pass through a very narrow passage.  Others may attempt to pass beneath the bridge while closed potentially colliding with the bridge and becoming trapped in a extremely strong current forcing boat to take on water and capsize or sink. We are not dealing with licensed drivers and traffic lights. It is a dangerous crossing even now.  The only possible good fix or schedule to make this situation safer would be total re constuction of the bridge in which you nor I have any control over at this time.  The Treasure Coast marine industry is thriving to say the least.  The increasing number of boaters in this area support hundreds of jobs and businesses in this area. Maybe to much?  The impact of this RR bridge schedule does nothing to help this area and will only benefit the few who decide to ride the train.  Worst of all it creates a extremely dangerous situation for local boaters.  the longer boaters are forced to wait, the stupider they will get.  You and your crews will be responding to boating catastrophes and you will witness injuries and death as a result of this project and your proposed management of bridge scheduled closures.  Thank you for taking the time to consider my thoughts.  David Dawson

I have personally experienced, the safety issues that occur when the bridge remains down for more than several minutes, especially during high boat traffic days and times.  Boats pile up in line in both directions waiting for the bridge to open.  The tide movement causes these boats to constantly maneuver their position so that they don’t run into each other.  Then, when the bridge goes open, it’s a mad rush to get through in BOTH directions!  The passage opening is narrow and if any one of the many captains is not highly experienced, it’s a disaster just waiting to happen.  I have seen multiple accidents with damage to both boats and the opening structure!

There is also the weather concern, especially during summer afternoons.  Boaters have no safety options when caught on the water during a thunderstorm.  Any attempt to reach home before the storm hits is thwarted by a bridge stuck down for even a 15 minute span!

Tax payers, like me, have more than funded this project we didn’t want in the first place!  There is absolutely NO REASON any of these bridges cannot be replaced with a mechanism that allows for on demand opening like it has been run for years.  The bridge in Jupiter was replaced, however, two weeks ago we arrived at the bridge which was in the down position and waited a full 20 minutes before a freight train finally came through.  We then waited another 15 minutes after the train passed before the bridge went up.  This is just ridiculous!  

As the Coast Guard your primary concern should be the safety of all boaters, not the convenience of Brightline trains. I beg you to please require both the Stuart and Jupiter bridge remain open unless a train is coming through.

Thank you",,,,,,,

Although I do not necessarily transit the bridge area daily, I have been hindered on multiple occasions when there are trains crossing both north and south bound. On each occurrence, I have been forced to wait idly approximately 45 minutes in tidal waters with multiple other boats. As we all know, some boaters are better than others with boat handling (and this is in calm seas).  Additionally, sailboats are slower maneuvering thereby allowing for less boat traffic to pass. And finally, this waiting around burns excessive fuel needlessly. 

I believe if boats have to wait, trains must also slow or wait for passage. It only seems fair that the inconvenience is not one-sided.

Boating is a huge business in Stuart, attracting boaters from all over the world, one reason being the easy access to the Atlantic Ocean.  It creates many jobs and is a huge source of revenue. If boaters are forced to spend time waiting to either get to the ocean or return home, word will soon spread and they will find another place to spend their leisure time and dollars.

The revenue from the boating industry in Stuart far exceeds the revenue, if any, from the Brigtline train. Not only will this service cause immense distress to the residents in terms of personal safety, noise, pollution and traffic jams at railway crossings, now, to those in the boating industry, they face possible layoffs and financial hardship when owners take their crafts elsewhere.

Stuart is home to many boaters from Canada as it’s relatively easy to get to but they will look elsewhere along the Atlantic coast for a place that accommodates them rather than a railway service.

I respectfully ask that boaters take precedence over the railway.",,,,,,,

When the bridge closes for a train the boat traffic can be backed up considerably and cause dangerous boating accidents on both sides of the bridge.If a boat should experience engine failure during its passing, both sides of the bridge traffic will be seriously backed up. Frequent bridge closings will also cause serious backups for boaters to access this route to the ocean. Also, if a boater is hurt on his boat at sea and needs to return quickly home, a bridge close tie up could seriously impede his ability to seek medical attention. Restricting the boaters access on the water is a serious restriction to our freedom to use our boats, as well as the ability for the Coast Guard or Marine Police to defend our waterfront homes. Please consider These challenges when you make rules for railroad bridge access and continue to give boaters fair and free access to our waterways.",,,,,,,

Has the Corp of Engineers given numbers of boats transiting the locks daily, Grand Banks Yachts does sea trials daily, Sunset Bay is not only a destination but also a much preferred fuel stop. Many boaters prefer the Okeechobee WW to going around the Keys. It is a challenge to make it east to west (Stuart- Ft. Myers) in a day. If you have to start west of the bridge because of the timing of the trains and opening it ads more cost to the transit.",,,,,,,

In my opinion, at a minimum, boaters must have at least as much opportunity to pass as trains.  Anything less is unacceptable. This could also cause boating backup waiting to cross under the bridge and setup possible accidents with close crowding of waiting boats.  THis is just not a good idea.

Yes. I have my 30’ center console boat in dry storage at the Loggerhead Riverwatch Marina, and transit frequently through the FEC railroad bridge crossing the Okeechobee Waterway at Stuart, FL to travel to and from the St. Lucie Inlet. There are no other dry storage facilities available to accommodate a vessel of this size east of the bridge.

(2) How often do you transit this waterway?
At least twice daily 4 days per week.

(3) If railway traffic impedes your navigation of this area, how long are you normally delayed?
They railroad bridge is lowered for at least 30 minutes to accommodate trains. It then takes about 15-20 minutes to clear the waiting vessels; longer on weekends and Holidays.

(4) How would you propose to regulate the balance of railway and maritime traffic in this area?
Brightline was supposed to build a new railroad bridge as part of the agreement to let them operate the high speed trains through Stuart. The solution is NOT to increase the frequency of bridge span closures of the 100 year old dilapidated bridge, but rather to widen the span to make it safer for boat passage and increase the clearance to 14 feet to match the adjacent SR 707 bridge.

(5) What challenges have you experienced when transiting this area due to these bridges and/or railway activity?
Excessive wait times from lowering the railroad bridge long before a train is near. Excessive vessels waiting to pass through the narrow railroad bridge span passage creating unsafe conditions. There are many inexperienced boaters who have difficulty navigating the passage given the narrow width and strong currents – an accident waiting to happen.

(6) Is a 15 minute hourly opening schedule sufficient for marine traffic? If not, please explain why.
No. Leaving the bridge down for 45 minutes will only increase the number of vessels waiting to pass through, and all waiting vessels will not make it through in 15 minutes, as it currently takes more time than that with a 30 minute closing. The situation is exacerbated if multiple large vessels need to transit as there is only room for one vessel to pass at a time and vessels are moving at minimum wake  speeds.

(7) Should the SR 707 (Dixie Hwy) Bridge opening schedule mirror the operating schedule of the FEC Railroad Bridge?
It is not necessary to mirror the opening schedule of the SR 707 Bridge. It opens on demand during the weekdays and every 20 minutes on the weekends.

My husband and I chose to live in North River Shores because of the access to the water and the property values within our neighborhood.  
The railroad bridge crosses the only waterway passage to access the Intercostal  and St. Lucie Inlet from our neighborhood. The residents in Palm City and St. Lucie county use the passage as well. 
Just within the past month, our family has experienced several long wait times (45minutes and longer)during the weekends at the railroad bridge.  Not only was the wait time a problem, but 30-40 boats, all of different lengths and widths, became an issue. The wind and the current were not in our favor on this day either. One boater became upset because he felt we were trying to “cut” in front of him and began yelling, “Stay in line!!!!!” We were simply trying to turn our vessel away from the of the pile up of boats that was staring to occur. Even Seatow, who was in tow, had issues navigating. 
I hate to imagine the outcome with the proposed schedule of the railroad bridge. This is going to become a VERY dangerous area for All boaters. 
There are many factors to consider why the new proposed railroad schedule will make this area challenging! 
A new marina is being built in this small congested area, which will add to volume of boaters. Not to mention the channel and shallow oyster beds within this small area that all boaters must navigate through. This area is a no wake zone, and we have witnessed “plowing” ( term used for creating a large wake)by boaters to make it through the railroad bridge before it closes. DANGEROUS!!!!! 
The narrow passage allows for only one large vessel at a time. Which means smaller boats must give right away to.
One of the three basic roles of the Coast Guard is safety. 
This area in Martin County regarding the railroad bridge and Brightline, is becoming a safety issue for the boating community. 
This proposal will damage our way of the life, the safety of all boaters, and the property values on the westside of the railroad bridge.
Brightline has already made a negative impact on our community, and the train hasn’t even begun to run through our towns.  Don’t allow them to destroy and take away our freedom of boating too.  Happy and SAFE boating!!

Seven years ago, my wife and I moved to Stuart for the sole purpose of pursuing and enjoying a life on the waterways that make Stuart so special. We purchased a home that is approximately three miles inland of the FEC Railroad Bridge, up the North Fork of the St. Lucie River. We are typically on our boat once or twice a week with the FEC Railroad Bridge affecting our boating on a weekly basis. When we are prevented from transiting the waterway because the railroad bridge is lowering, or already in the closed position, we have a wait of 15 to 20 minutes. Depending on the day of the week and the time of day, we have experienced as many as 25 - 30 boats waiting to transist the waterway. Many of these boats also require an opening from the SR 707 Bridge, adding further congestion to the delay. The close proximity of three bridges, coupled with tidal current and wind, exacerbate this situation.
The easy and most appropriate solution to this maritime situation is to relocate the high speed passenger trains to tracks further west in Martin County. It is my opinion that the City of Stuart was not designed for the safe passage of high speed trains. The most important factor being safety. That said, I don't know a boater who has passed by the railroad bridge and hasn't questioned the safety of the railroad bridge. These opinions are based on the looks of the rusty, degraded-looking condition of the bridge.
If the rail service is not re-assigned to tracks in a less populated area of the county where this major maritime issue would be avoided, then the question of the bridge opening frequency should be designed in favor of the boaters, this is a heavily used waterway.
First, a new higher clearance bridge should be required. This makes common sense and would permit the passage of most recreational boats without requiring a bridge opening. 
Secondly, railroad bridge openings should be scheduled at least every 15 to 20 minutes.
Lastly, the opening schedule for the SR 707 bridge should mirror the opening schedule of the FEC Railroad Bridge if the railroad bridge has a lower or equal to clearance height. Why consider opening the automobile bridge if boats are not able to pass under the closed railroad bridge?
Please put the safety of the boaters before the desires of the passenger train company.",,,,,,,

Yes, regularly out of Riverwatch Marina. You must cross this bridge to reach the ocean. 

(2) How often do you transit this waterway?

Weekly at minimum. 

(3) If railway traffic impedes your navigation of this area, how long are you normally delayed?

The longest I have ever been caught by the railbridge is approximately 45 minutes. Mininum 20-30 minutes but can be longer depending on how many boats are backed up on either side of the bridge. The water transit way is narrow and treacherous and must be approached slowly and carefully. 

(4) How would you propose to regulate the balance of railway and maritime traffic in this area?
Boaters and trains should be given equal access at minimum, 30 minutes for boating and 30 minutes for rail. 

(5) What challenges have you experienced when transiting this area due to these bridges and/or railway activity?

Boats back up on either side of the rail bridge in the confined water space available. At peak hours, this creates mass chaos once the bridge finally opens as boaters cut each other off and race to squeeze past each other in the narrow transit area under the rail bridge. 

(6) At what frequency and duration should the drawbridge openings occur in order to meet the needs of navigation?

The drawbridge should be open at mininum for 30 minutes per hour during daylight hours and around the clock at night. 

(7) Should the SR 707 (Dixie Hwy) Bridge opening schedule mirror the operating schedule of the FEC Railroad Bridge?

No, the majority of boats are limited only by the rail bridge and not by the highway bridge. The highway bridge should remain on demand. ",,,,,,,

Throw in frustrated, aggressive drivers and you have a recipe for disaster. Of course, the old Roosevelt Bridge would also have to be open to coincide with the  opened railroad bridge. If we must compromise with the Brightline Bullies it has to be fair and safe for BOTH sides. Realize the decision made affects not only recreational boaters but commercial fisherman, marinas, restaurants and countless businesses who depend on and enjoy this open waterway. Allowing Brightline 15 minutes per hour to use OUR waterway is a big enough concession for our waterfront city.",,,,,,,

Brightline is already ranked #11 for causing deaths and with increased traffic it's ranking will rise as statistically there will be more unnecessary deaths, to include boaters. Why should taxpayer money be allocated to increase the safety of a foreign owned private company?  They are causing the problem and they should pay, and be fined.

(1) Do you currently transit through the FEC Railroad Bridge crossing the Okeechobee Waterway, mile 7.4, at Stuart, Florida? YES!

(2) How often do you transit this waterway? At least two times per day, sometimes more.

(3) If railway traffic impedes your navigation of this area, how long are you normally delayed? Depends, sometimes over 90 minutes, then with no train. On average at least 30 minutes.

(4) How would you propose to regulate the balance of railway and maritime traffic in this area? Have a bridge tender, someone with direct communication to know when and if a train is coming and also base that upon the speed of the train. Send more traffic west to Seaboard System Railroad. If Tri-rail is going to send traffic to FEC, send freight and passenger back to SSR. Then mandate Groupo Mexico, a non-US company, to construct a second RR bridge. They are currently adding a second track that was originally there and removed years ago. With a second RR bridge, time north bound and south bound traffic to cross at the same time, thereby minimizing the time the RR bridge will be lowered.

(5) What challenges have you experienced when transiting this area due to these bridges and/or railway activity? If the RR bridge is stuck up, it will delay shipment of goods. For passengers, they can disembark and though not easy, find alternate transportation.  If the bridge is stuck down Maritime activity is at a standstill without recourse and boats backing up creating more chaos when and if it the bridge raises. If stuck down, no rescue service, no Boat US or Sea Tow, no Coast Guard, no Martin County Sheriff boat patrol. The current opening for boat traffic is 50 feet. When boats back up waiting to get through, it's pure pandemonium with boats trying to get through from both directions. A sure prescription for incidents. 

(6) At what frequency and duration should the drawbridge openings occur in order to meet the needs of navigation? Most drawbridges have a tender and open on an as needed basis as should this, not based upon whatever in Jacksonville. Will need a tender.  A hard schedule doesn't take into account higher boat traffic on weekends and holidays.

(7) Should the SR 707 (Dixie Hwy) Bridge opening schedule mirror the operating schedule of the FEC Railroad Bridge? Back to previous issues, weekends and holidays. And since no closing schedule has been proposed, one can't agree to a mirror schedule. Plus it's a bogus question. Right now the estimate is 60 trains per day, but based upon what?  If SSR is sending traffic to FEC, and they'll increase the number and are already saying the length of freight trains, who knows what the train traffic will eventually be. The RR bridge lowers sometimes 30 minutes before an actual train crosses.  With the touted increase in train traffic, the way it's operated now, the RR bridge will never be up. From the beginning they lied about the entire process saying they were going to construct a RR bridge with an 18-foot clearance, which will never, ever, happen, else you wouldn't be asking these questions. It was never about passenger trains, all about freight. With limited access in and out, property prices on homes west of the bridge will decrease. Then there's the increase of deaths due to more trains, now at 60+, at crossings. With the RR bridge being down longer and more than ever, how many boating accidents will be attributed to boaters trying to get through a narrow passage when they've been delayed for who knows how long? The whole train thing is a scam. A Mexican, Larrea Mota Velasco, could care less about boat traffic, car-train deaths, future boating deaths, inconveniencing millions of Floridians, allowing more crime with train access to cities previously untouched with easy access and egress, as long as he can make money. US taxpayers should not subsidize this venture. The original plan as advertised was only four stops (Miami, Ft Lauderdale, Palm Beach, and Orlando). Now they creep and up the ante, with more stops. You can't trust anything they say.",,,,,,,

I live just west of the 100yr old railroad bridge and commute underneath it at least 3 times a week. My boat cannot pass under the rail bridge when it is in the down position. Most of my friends and neighbors boats also cannot pass under in the closed position, which it seems to be a lot now. The passage under the rail bridge is already narrow at 50’. This is made even more dangerous when the tide is changing. Add to it a weekend such as Memorial Day, Father’s Day, 4th of July, Labor Day or a fishing tournament and the flood of boats through that passage is downright scary. 
Just the other weekend we were stuck for hours waiting on a train that never came! Boats began to pile up on both sides of the bridge (has happened many times!) and after hours of waiting the bridge finally opened and a flood of boats rushed through from both directions. We had to wait another 20minutes for it to thin out just to jump in line. 
Many people tried to slide under the other sections, some even hitting the bridge.
This will be the situation everyday at this bridge if they are allowed to run rough shot over this small town’s boating community and marine industry.

How many deaths have occurred at Brightline RR crossings so far, 60? 70? That’s a static environment that everyone is familiar with. Compound that danger with the river current, multiple closings per hour, and the maddening rush of boats trying to run the gauntlet before the bridge is down again and you can guarantee there will be accidents and deaths because of this.

FEC per their application, wants to increase freight trains to 24 per day as well as increase the average train to 8100’! That on top of the proposed 60 passenger trains a day (2023) there is bo way that bridge will be open much at all to boaters, let alone emergency vessels and maritime industry such as the boat yards, restaurants and towing services..

The deal before was to raise the bridge to 18’. That should be the bare minimum Brightline and FEC does if they want to increase rail traffic through our small town, bottomline..",,,,,,"https://downloads.regulations.gov/USCG-2022-0222-1483/attachment_4.pdf,https://downloads.regulations.gov/USCG-2022-0222-1483/attachment_4.jpg,https://downloads.regulations.gov/USCG-2022-0222-1483/attachment_1.pdf,https://downloads.regulations.gov/USCG-2022-0222-1483/attachment_1.jpg,https://downloads.regulations.gov/USCG-2022-0222-1483/attachment_3.pdf,https://downloads.regulations.gov/USCG-2022-0222-1483/attachment_3.jpg,https://downloads.regulations.gov/USCG-2022-0222-1483/attachment_2.pdf,https://downloads.regulations.gov/USCG-2022-0222-1483/attachment_2.jpg",

RE: Docket Number: USCG-2022-0222 / Drawbridge Operation Regulation; Okeechobee Waterway

Dear Rear Admiral McPherson, 

Marine Industries Association of Florida, Inc. (aka MIAF) is a trade association representing all segments and regions of the marine industry throughout the state of Florida. We are a 23.3-billion-dollar industry that supports 92,000 jobs in Florida. 
This letter is to express our recommendations & concerns for the drawbridge operation of the Okeechobee Waterway. The Okeechobee Waterway is a vital navigation corridor for marine transport, both commercial and recreational, for the state marine industry. Following is a list of our concerns & proposed options:
•	15 minutes per hour suggested opening is not sufficient time for vessels to transit. Currently the span width only allows one direction to transit at a time. We are hopeful a 30-minute opening per hour will be manageable most days (excluding holidays and hurricane evacuation events). Anything less would not be a fair and equitable use of the waterway.
•	The 2018 waterway study on which you are basing your recommendation is no longer accurate. Early this year Florida exceeded 1 million registered boaters and the regions that utilize this corridor the most have seen a significant increase in boating activity. We recommend you address and update this study to reflect current conditions.
•	On the Federal Register / Vol. 87, No. 85 / Tuesday, May 3, 2022 / Proposed Rules; page 26146, under Supplementary Information, section II. Background, Purpose and Purpose, 2nd paragraph; describes the SR 707 (Dixie Hwy) Bridge as a double-leaf bascule bridge. This has been a single-leaf bridge since 1996, when the completion of the fixed bridge structure to its east was opened. Google map image attached. 
•	For safety purposes, we recommend moorings and pilings on both the west and east side of the bridge for commercial and large recreational vessels. A piling system like the current set-up at the locks could be a good example. This area would need more pilings and they would need to be spaced closer together. Google map image attached.
•	Hurricane Evacuation Route – This marine corridor is a major evacuation route for both the east and west coast of Florida. A vessel can’t outrun a storm and this corridor is safe harbor for a significant amount of our boating population during these significant weather events. We request priority right-away during these weather episodes.
•	Since Brightline is already running their training schedule through the region, we would like mariners to have access to utilize the train rail bridge schedule app immediately. As part of the bridge operations permit, the railroad is required to maintain the app in an up to date, accurate and working order.
•	Coordinate railroad rehab and maintenance closings with the upcoming Lock maintenance and repair closures. This could shorten the complete closure of this waterway significantly over the next 5-10 years.
•	The best option for our boating community is to have a safe and long-term solution to this essential marine corridor. A new rail-bridge that can better support both rail and mariners is needed for the long-term joint usage of this major waterway.
Thank you for considering our perspective. Please know that our interest is to have the safest and best infrastructure in place for the future of the Marine Industry in Florida.
Yours Truly, 
 
April Price, President

But as I travel in the area I have noticed several large boats waiting to pass through due to the railroad bridge being down ,,, (this is usually on the weekends when I am out on my boat) For numerous reasons I believe that they should add a second railroad bridge next to the current bridge for the added rail traffic ,,, although I am sure Debt construction delays would also impede boat traffic of all sizes but it would be for a limited time and would better serve the public safety on the waters over the waters and on the streets of the surrounding Stuart area. 
As a taxpayer and a Florida resident I do not want to see any restrictions of Commerce on the waterways of our beautiful area tourism is a main attraction as well with many large vessels that travel through that area which is about to be restricted …
I would like to submit my contact information for any other further comments…

Please let me start off by saying thank you for what you do Coast Guard. I have lived in Palm City my whole life and been on the water,I am very familiar with the treacherous conditions transitioning the narrow railroad bridge. This area is subject to strong currents due to its underwater topography. Many vessel operators have struggled to maintain position during close bridge operations, as well as navigate the restrictive narrow train bridge opening with other vessel traffic. I feel this would exasperate the problem with only having the railroad bridge open 15 minutes per hour. From a public safety standpoint, I think that will create an absolute hazard. The St. Lucie River/Okeechobee Waterway also serves as a hurricane evaluation route for boaters looking to flee the East coast with inclement weather. Currently I transit this area 4 to 6 times per week.If the train bridge is down,I would say a fair average would be 20 minutes of wait time. From a public safety aspect, I feel it would only be reasonable to maintain the railroad bridge in the up position at a minimum of 20minutes per hour. They initially said they were change the bridge to be much higher so most boats wouldn’t be inconvenienced. 
Thank You Again for what you do,
Joy Savikas

The low clearance of the RR bridge serves to stop all boat traffic when lowered. Maintaining a safe operating distance from adjacent vessels during either incoming or outgoing tides presents a real challenge to even the most experienced boaters. The more frequently the bridge is closed, the more hazardous this becomes, especially to the many slow maneuvering sailboats in the many marinas near the bridge.",,,,,,,

Yes, I transit this area as I live on the North Fork of the St Lucie and fish from Stuart to the Inlet with a 10 mile radius.

(2) How often do you transit this waterway? I transit this waterway on a weekly basis. 1-2 times per week during Nov. - May months.

(3) If railway traffic impedes your navigation of this area, how long are you normally delayed? Normally takes 20-30 minutes from when the bridge comes down, sometimes more.

(4) How would you propose to regulate the balance of railway and maritime traffic in this area? The bridge should be replaced, its aging and inadequate. It should be open 45 minutes every hour, but when single closings for freight trains take more than that its impossible. 

(5) What challenges have you experienced when transiting this area due to these bridges and/or railway activity? When strong tidal currents combine with  high traffic and  a very narrow passage way accidents will occur. I have a small boat, but still cannot pass thru the bridge at same time when some of the larger boats are passing. 

(6) Is a 15 minute hourly opening schedule sufficient for marine traffic? If not, please explain why. A 15 minute opening is way too short of an opening for boaters. A 15 minute opening will cause people to try to rush through an already tough area to navigate. There is very little waiting room and its difficult to hold a position. 

(7) Should the SR 707 (Dixie Hwy) Bridge opening schedule mirror the operating schedule of the FEC Railroad Bridge?  Yes,,,and there will still be problems as described by many here.",,,,,,,

Master Certificate and find the present bridge operation to be a challenge at times even with the current level of rail traffic. I have had to wait on occasion for more than 45 minutes while the railroad bridge prepares to lower, lowers, and on occasion remains closed for an extended period prior to the arrival of a train and while it passes, all while marine traffic accumulates.
Safety must be a primary consideration influencing any decision. Marine vessel congestion at the choke point of the railroad bridge is already a problem during busy periods for multiple reasons including the narrow opening, very limited space on the east side to wait for the bridge to open, and lack of a clear line of sight to understand the extent of approaching vessel traffic from either side of the bridges.  
Further restricting the safe passage of marine vessels through the area would also have a negative impact on local businesses and residents and unnecessarily limit and restrict public access to the Okeechobee Waterway.
The existing bridge is very old and was constructed with a completely different marine vehicle traffic dynamic than what exists today. It makes no sense to further significantly restrict marine vessel traffic for the sole benefit of a railroad system that only transits the area with no significant benefit to the residents and others using the waterway. 
The only reasonable solution that I can see is replacing the railroad bridge with a combination elevated structure and efficient opening section that allows a high percentage of vessels to pass without requiring an opening. The ultimate design should be based on good engineering judgement that will effectively facilitate and support both the railroad and marine vessel traffic with minimal impediment to either. 
A thorough marine traffic study and analysis is needed to determine an acceptable minimum bridge clear height requirement that supports an acceptable percentage of passage for vessels not requiring a railroad bridge opening. The roadway bridge is not encumbered by a fixed schedule lending to significantly more flexibility. It is imperative that both the vehicle and railroad bridges operate in concert for larger vessels to pass, and both bridges must stay open long enough for all vessels waiting to safely pass or serious accidents could be expected.
The Brightline system came with a very significant cost which should have included new properly engineered bridges that would improve and not worsen the current situation. My recollection is that is how the project was originally sold to the public.
Consideration must also be given to the future with anticipated population growth and an increase in the number marine vessels transiting the area.

(1) Do you currently transit through the FEC Railroad Bridge crossing the Okeechobee Waterway, mile 7.4, at Stuart, Florida?
Yes, I live less than 1.5 miles from the trestle, have a watercraft that me and my family use for recreational use, and must transit the Railroad Crossing at Roosevelt Bridge to access open ocean, Intracoastal waterway, downtown Sruart community docs and area commercial waterway business of the greater St Lucie River and Inlet.

(2) How often do you transit this waterway?  I average transits about 2-3x weekly.  Each transit is twice daily, outbound (down river, eastbound) and inbound my residential community.

(3) If railway traffic impedes your navigation of this area, how long are you normally delayed?  If the bridge is actively down upon arrival, it can average 15 minutes if the train is crossing (5 min for long freight), then a wait for the command from bridge/rail control center in Jax, Fl. and another 3-5 minutes for the bridge to raise in completely ""up"" position (circa 1911 machinery, very slow!).  I have waited as long as 75-90 minutes at idle in the waterway, awaiting what the drawbridge tender has told assembled boats on a Saturday afternoon on Ch9 vhf, is a relay from the FEC dispatch that ""another train is enroute and the bridge will remain down"" ....after 35 minutes, an additional train transits, taking 12 minutes to pass, the bridge retract in up position and assembled boats (estimated at 50-75 vessels) pass through.  That process to clear takes a minimum of 20 minutes to safely clear the passage for all vessels.

(4) How would you propose to regulate the balance of railway and maritime traffic in this area?  Hard to say without knowing how often the rail schedule will require access, but the Brightline company stated the bridge would be down only for a few minutes to allow high speed train crossings, which we have not expreienced to date.  Freight/commercial trains have taken minimum 15 minutes and averge 25-30 per crossing.  For boats with 5'-18' above high water for clearance, as discussed in 2021 and up until January 2022, this was not to be an issue when the railroad trestle was to be replaced with an elevated trestle with minimum above water clearance of 18'.  That promise was rescinded, and the antiquated trestle is what remains, with excessive raise/lower times, a remote operated, less than optimal system of activation, and a schedule that is to be determined.

(5) What challenges have you experienced when transiting this area due to these bridges and/or railway activity?  No VHF communications, general announcements, a firm schedule for opening/closing, and little regard for the needs of afloat traffic, in my view.  The narrow (less than 40') nature of the trestle opening also exacerbates the bi-directional flow of the vessels in transit.  Very narrow and collision avoidance is difficult with wide-beamed sportfishers, motoryachts, and commerciat barge traffic transiting with a multitude of smaller outboard and pwc recreational traffic, all vying for the same waterspace.

(6) At what frequency and duration should the drawbridge openings occur in order to meet the needs of navigation?  The railroad should be held to a plan that replaces the antique bridge with the original plan to replace with something new, height increased, wider opening for traffic.  Right now, the bridge is down, 
 closed to boat traffic estimated at 2.5 hrs daily in a 24 hr period, and a large portion of that is at night, between midnight and 0600 local.  To impose restrictions that close the bridge any less that that are not what the public signed on for when there was agreement to permit train use increase of the high speed rail project.

(7) Should the SR 707 (Dixie Hwy) Bridge opening schedule mirror the operating schedule of the FEC Railroad Bridge?  Not sure what that impact is, except for large vessels, but it certainly would make sense to maximize any opening of the railroad bridge to be mirrored, if that opening time is to be so restrictive that larger vessel requiring the drawbridge/road bridge to be open need to have both bridge open for the short/minimal periods available tor passing.
+Bottom line: The bridge down restricts essential safety (emergency, law enforcement, fisheries, and commercial boating traffic) as well as the recreational boater in the area from transiting this critical chokepoint.  Freedom of navigation on our local waterways would be severely impacted with any open times less than what is currently experienced.  A reliable, published schedule would be a good start for co-use of the waterway crossing. Effective communications with a live body, not a computer 200 miles away controlling the bridge, would be a welcome improvement.  A plan to improve the navigable access with heigth, width improvement for the future should be mandatory.",,,,,,,

A 15 minute window will not adequately allow for safe passage of marine traffic.  It is interesting to note that the Loxahatchee bridge is being completely rebuilt to allow 2-way traffic and will be higher when closed, Where as no such plans are currently in place for the St Lucie crossing.  The St. Lucie is part of a commercial water way and often times a single commercial vessel can take 8 to 12 minutes to clear the span in one direction.  Current through the bridge peaks at over 2 knots making it a difficult passage.  this will be compounded when there is a back up of traffic.  The amount of damage visible on the current bridge fendering system demonstrates how often significant impacts occur.  Presently a single train will cause a closure for upto 45 minutes.  A reciprocal Train could add as much.  Staging of multiple trains to pass each other on either side of the river will also shut down vehicle traffic crippling commerce in Stuart and Jensen as well as impacting emergency services.  The congested marine traffic as mariners jocky to get through the openings will add further risk to the public. This is primarily a public right of way and leaving it closed 75% of the time for private commercial interests is not remotely in the public interest.  It is logical that the ""Old Roosevelt"" bridge will need to open before the RR Bridge goes up and remain open until all marine trafic is clear.  The resulting road back ups will make surface traffic nearly impassable more than 30 minutes out of each hour.  A 2-way RR bridge that is elivated to match the auto bridge would reduce the traffic back ups on the water and land.  A regulation requiring the RR to schedule trains to be passing North and South at the same time as they transit the bridge would cut the amount of time that the bridge must be closed in half.  This will clear both the water way and the surface roads much quicker.  The expansion of RR service is vital, but must be integrated into the rest of the transportation system and not just super imposed over it.  The same type of improvements that are being made over the rest of the RR route should also be applied to the St Lucie River Bridge.  Two Way traffic and increaced vertical clearance would greatly reduce the comercial and saftey impacts both to mariners and vehicle traffic.  The impovements to fire rescue transits alone would warrant the implementation.",,,,,,,

I am a retired Vascular Surgeon residing in North River Shores since 1996 and I have been an avid boater for most of my life. I am a past president of the Fort Pierce Sportfishing Club. I am aware of the proposal to limit the time the railroad bridge will be available to boaters, At the present time when the railroad bridge is down there is a small and reasonable delay of about 20 minutes for a single train to pass however I have witnessed more than one train passing in which case the railroad bridge stays down the entire time resulting in a 40 minute delay when two trains pass or longer when three trains pass without the bridge going up. The backup of boats quickly becomes a serious problem especially as only 2 small boats can pass the railroad at the same time. Any larger boats delay traffic further as they have to completely traverse the bridge passage before anyone else can do so. I have personally witnessed boats responding to the railroad bridge alarm signal by revving up their engines and ignoring the no wake status to get through the bridge before being delayed. I can only imagine the unmitigated disaster that will result if the railroad bridge is closed for any significant length of time and I am sure you can too. Accidents, injuries, lawsuits and all manor of mayhem will be the easily predictable result of restricting boat passage for any increased length of time.
Having said this I fully understand that there will be increased train traffic in the near future and some accommodation must be made. I think it should be noted and taken into account that this situation has very little to do with alternative passenger transportation rather the need for massively increased freight traffic. My neighbor Senator Gayle Harrell as head of the Florida Transportation Committee offered the FEC sufficient funds to create a 1 mile track leading to a bypass onto the CFX tracks thus avoiding all the problems they have caused by running all the freight trains up the middle of the state and eliminating all these issues by they refused. Perhaps an investigation of their refusal is warranted.
At any rate until a new railroad bridge can be constructed to the same height as the Dixie Highway bridge my suggestion is that the railroad bridge should be up during the top of each hour and down during the bottom of the hour. Anything less than this will result in a very predictable disaster and many boating accidents.

I am a long time resident and boater, and use this area of the waterway frequently.  I’m my opinion moving form the current closed on demand policy to an open 15 mins every hours policy is a huge shift and inequitable to the thousands of boaters that use these waterways.  With a bridge closed clearance of around 6’ to 7’ this action impacts even smaller vessels with T-Tops.    45 minutes is not a minor inconvenience, it is a considerable burden, especially considering that it totals 1.5 hours on a return trip.  

I think there are two potential solutions.  Optimally, Brightline should be funding the construction of a new bridge with an increased closed clearance height.  This is exactly why the Roosevelt bridge was rebuilt so long ago - didn’t FEC see this coming years ago?  I don’t think residents should suffer due to a lack of long range planning.  Less than optimal, but perhaps manageable would be opening the bridge every 15 minutes for boaters to pass.  That may not fit Brightline’s business plan, but it is just that - a business - that shouldn’t expect to take over a public waterway.  

Seizing this passage for 75%of the time is just not equitable or fair.  With rapidly changing weather conditions and  strong currents at tide changes it’s probably not even safe to have boaters waiting to pass for that long. 

Again, I really appreciate the opportunity to make a comment and hope that mine and others will be considered.  ",,,,,,,

 We saw a version of this on 7/4/2021 when the bridge was down at the end of the fireworks show in Stuart.  The waters was congested as boaters waited for the bridge to raise and when everyone started underway after the bridge was up, very unsafe and many near misses.  
I would like to proposed a 50/50 equitable use schedule for the bridge to be up and down for the short term.  In the long term, Brightline and state agencies need to replace this very old bridge with something that is modern, safe, faster and higher.  I understand this is a many years project so in the meantime - minimum of 30 minutes up / 30 minutes down.  50/50",,,,,,,

(5) What challenges have you experienced when transiting this area due to these bridges and/or railway activity? I can’t clear the RR bridge if it is down 45 open/15 closed. Its a navigation hazard and boater safety issue. Boats will be trapped in with side. There is very little maneuvering room. If you multiply the normal traffic by 3 or more, it will trip the number of boats passing under the brides. Additionally, if a storms cores through while waiting, people could be seriously injured. 

(6) At what frequency and duration should the drawbridge openings occur in order to meet the needs of navigation? 45 open and 15 down.

Just the mere idea of having what Mr Mast put I feel is even too generous the thought of the bridge being up for 30 minutes in a 2 hour period is an awe full lot. From the perspective of a boater that is a lot time to have to plan for when a severe weather system hits.

The train bridge in the St Lucie Waterway is not only an eyesore but a risk that has exceeded its useful life. When I have guests here they cannot believe it is still in operation!
Now we are going to increase traffic on this bridge and punish the taxpayers who utilize the waterway by restricting access. 
Aside from the major inconvenience of timing my trips out and back, I am concerned about safety:
- bridge and base that exhibit severe rusting and spalling
-availability for rescue personnel to get through in an emergency
-exposure to storms that pop up due to bridge closure
are some of my major concerns. 

Why has there been no planning communicated on updating the RR bridge that does not require opening?  When Virgin was involved I remember a plan that at least put some thought into the long term.  Instead it seems to be a mandate by “Authorities” that are short term and short sighted at best. 

A schedule could be set that has the bridge openings only on a set time (I.e. top of the hour) for 15 minutes.  If they are outside that window they would have to wait. Why can’t  the train passengers and customers be held to performance standards? A schedule could be communicated on a website and the trains be held to the schedule.  
If running early or late they will have to wait until the window opens up at top of hour. 

I am sure this is simplistic and needs some work, but to put the burden on local residents in favor of an inefficient 
System without a long range solution is not an equitable solution.  
I am willing to invest my time and be part of a task team to work this to an short and long term solution.  Do not hesitate to reach out to me. 

I do appreciate the opportunity to provide input here and in a longer term solution.

In addition to being avid boaters on the St. Lucie River, my husband and I own Meridian Marina in Palm City, FL. As an impacted business owner and personal boater in this community, I have significant concerns about the proposed changes to the FEC Railroad Bridge in Stuart. On many occasions, I have witnessed firsthand the dangerous conditions that occur when the drawbridge is down for any length of time on a busy weekend or holiday, and a dozen or more boats are forced to pile up in a tight, congested area with a strong current. I have witnessed at least one collision and almost been hit personally by boaters doing their best to hold their position against a ripping current, winds, and heavy congestion.

I would like to commend the Coast Guard for taking the important step to develop a predictable schedule of openings and closings. This is undoubtedly an important first step toward making passage along this critical waterway as safe as possible for the tens of thousands of boaters who access it annually. I appreciate it is not an easy task the Coast Guard is faced with to create a fair, reasonable, and most importantly, safe schedule that balances the needs of competing modes of transportation.

In doing so, I implore the Coast Guard to consider that the marine sector is and always has been the lifeblood of the Florida coast and its economy. Florida is the fastest growing state in the US. Every day, roughly 1,000 people relocate to Florida with “lifestyle” cited as the top reason. Recreational boating is a significant component of that lifestyle which draws people to this area and makes the local economy, businesses, and property values thrive. Beyond recreational boating, the St. Lucie River supports heavy marine commerce, including being the singular access point for thousands of commercial and recreational vessels traversing the Okeechobee Waterway, a vital artery connecting the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf Coast of the US since 1937.

Taking into consideration long-standing marine prevalence and precedence, economic, and life safety considerations, any schedule the Coast Guard develops should, at a minimum, provide for:

(1)At least 45 minutes of marine access per every hour from 6:00 AM through 8:59 PM, 7 days per week.
(2)No more than 15 consecutive minutes of drawbridge closure between the hours of 6:00 AM and 8:59 PM, 7 days a week.
(3)No more than 30 consecutive minutes of drawbridge closure outside of those hours.
(4)Extra priority for marine access should be given on Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays.
(5)The FEC Railroad bridge should be timed with the Dixie Highway bridge such that anytime the Dixie Highway bridge is up, the FEC Railroad Bridge must be up as well. However, given the significant difference in clearance heights allowing most boaters to pass under the Dixie Highway bridge, the FEC Railroad Bridge will require far more frequent and longer openings.

In summary, the waterway was here first. It holds precedence and is far more important to the local economy than pass-through train traffic. Restricting marine access beyond the parameters outlined above will have serious economic, lifestyle, and life safety implications.",,,,,,,

My family and I currently transit the RR bridge waterway 6 times weekly and have to spend a large amount of time waiting on the bridge in its current state. The other morning at 5:00 AM, we had to wait one hour before they would open the bridge. It is particularly problematic in the mornings when the RR is running freight and will keep the bridge down for extended times between trains. I call the RR company for information and repeatedly are told they are running late but they will not bring the bridge up. I have waited for over an hour and half before being able to pass through in the early morning. The weekends exacerbate a dangerous bottleneck due to the volume of boats trying to pass. The solution is not a new schedule that will heavily favor trains. The answer is replacing the 100 year old bridge with no clearance underneath. Even more important than that, the RR should parallel i-95 and not run 80 mph trains 28 times a day through heavily populated downtown communities. This will absolutely kill many more people than it already has and I am appalled that this plan is moving forward. To open only 15 minutes hourly must be a joke. It takes a large boat 4-5 minutes to position appropriately and pass through the bridges safely. There will be a large number of boats waiting on each side trying to pass through this small and dangerous window.",,,,,,,

Limiting the passage to just 15 minutes per hour is completely unreasonable. On any given weekend hundreds of boats pass thru this area.

I also believe that even a 30-minute per hour allocation will in practice amount to much less time, given the very conservative opening and closing policies, wherein the bridge will commonly be open for 45-50 minutes in order to accommodate a train that in reality takes 20 minutes to cross.

However, opening only 15 minutes per hour for boat transit would be insufficient to permit the smooth and efficient flow of marine traffic, particularly on the St. Lucie River. Known as the ""Boating Crossroads of Florida"", the watershed of the St. Lucie River connects commercial and recreational boaters with the Atlantic Ocean, IntraCoastal Waterway and (via the Okeechobee Waterway) the Gulf of Mexico. As such, it enjoys a high volume of boat traffic year-round. If transit is restricted on this vital watershed, it not only will restrict the ability of recreational boaters to freely travel in their vessels, but it also will impact the many marine-based businesses in the surrounding area. Although I do not currently own a motor boat, I also am concerned that closing the railroad bridge for 45 minutes per hour might also negatively impact property values on the west side of the railroad bridges -- particularly waterfront properties on the North and South Forks of the St. Lucie River. I feel strongly that opening the bridge at least twice per hour for 15 minutes each time on a published schedule would be the miminum amount of time needed to handle the boat traffic efficiently. Three openings of 10 minutes each per hour might also work but I would suggest a trial period to see if 10 minutes would be enough to handle the boat traffic buildup between openings.",,,,,,,

Let's talk economics:  As a boaters, we pay for boat registrations and sales tax on products we buy.  If you trailer your boat, you can add license plates and fuel tax.    Unlike boaters who have to pay to enjoy the sport, Brightline can only survive due to a subsidy from taxpayers/boaters.   Why can't Brightline be self sufficient?  If there is such a high level of demand for this service, they should not need to be funded by taxpayers.  Pull the Federal funding and let's see how long they stay in business.

Yes
(2) How often do you transit this waterway? On average ~10 times per month
(3) If railway traffic impedes your navigation of this area, how long are you normally delayed? ~45 min.
(4) How would you propose to regulate the balance of railway and maritime traffic in this area? 1) Raise the elevation of the railroad bridge to a clearance that will facilitate 75% of maritime traffic to pass without opening (i.e. recreational center consoles with a standard height T-top) or 2) allow for 20 minute bridge closures that are scheduled, so boaters know to plan their trip around the times the bridge will restrict passage.  
(5) What challenges have you experienced when transiting this area due to these bridges and/or railway activity?  Low clearance while railroad bridge is down restricts passage to most maritime traffic.  Vessels stack up on either side of the railroad bridge and all try to navigate through the passage at the same time when the bridge opens creating an extremely dangerous situation for boaters.  These conditions are typically in conjunction with strong tidal currents that also impact navigation and captains' ability to course correct when dealing with high traffic periods.
(6) Is a 15 minute hourly opening schedule sufficient for marine traffic? If not, please explain why.  Absolutely not, it takes 5 mins to navigate the no wake channel alone.  When boats are stacked up due to a closure and waiting for an opportunity to ""get in-line"" to navigate the passage, it can easily take longer than the proposed 15 minutes.  Captains eager to get through, begin to take unnecessary risks creating a dangerous scenario for all boaters trying to get through.

The current changes caused by tidal influence as well as means of propulsion for the boats makes it difficult to compare boat traffic with automobile traffic.  It is not imperative that a random Tuesday at 4:00 pm has equal time.  There are identifiable patterns of boat traffic.  Both the marine industry and the automobile traffic would be better served identifying the peak use times for each.  For example, it would be better to give more time to marine traffic from 7:00 am until 10:00 am on Saturday and Sunday and the same for 3:00 pm until 6:00 pm.  In exchange, the train traffic could utilize weekdays and darkness.    The most important and significant issue is the single lane for train traffic.  That is not a feasible method.  Even if the bridge did not need to open, the impacts to automobile traffic caused by freight slowing down to comply with staging to take turns crossing the bridge with passenger trains and trains traveling in the opposite direction will be catastrophic.  If a freight train used to block an intersection for 12 minutes but now has to cut its speed in half to make sure that it doesnt arrive at the same time as another train, it could result in that original intersection being blocked for 24 minutes.  The congestion will end up at every intersection in Martin County.  Safety will cause staging to take place along the entire Railroad corridor and slowing trains to wait for openings or other trains to pass will cause delays at all intersections.",,,,,,,

I have seen Collisions and even heard of a sailboat mast being crushed by the RR  span lowering without audible or visual warnings..  If there are 10 vessels that need both spans opened (5 Westbound, 5 Eastbound) it could easily take 25 minutes to safely clear.  Perhaps a there shall be a “Hard” 25 minute window on the start of the Hour that the RR span remains open and the vehicle bascule bridge is operational to lift for boats.",,,,,,,

This is where this conversation should revert to, rather than the burden of the decision be put on others including a community who has no interest in a Brightline location here. Our communities largest concern is around long-term navigational safety, fair access to our waterways and viability of existing infrastructure. We do not understand why bright line, either through the coast guard’s ultimate decision, which could trigger them to rethink the modernization if it prevails in our favor, or state forces is not being taken to task on honoring their commitments which would render the need for this conversation as moot. 
Rather, they ask you to impose harsh restrictions on access to the very outdoor activities that made us invest in the community in the first place. 

Comment #2: We would also call for publishing an analysis of vessel traffic that has been conducted by a 3rd party (WGI,Kimley Horn,Etc.), to understand what the Coast Guard believes to be the impact of this change on the surrounding community, modeled with the different bridge opening scenarios being presented by all parties. 

Unless you understand the constraints as a result of the time windows being proposed, the analysis of boat traffic based on time of day on weekdays/weekends, size of boats traversing the waterway tied to ownership within the community and what those constraints would ultimately do to public safety, then a thorough analysis has not been conducted. 

I believe there should be different considerations during weekdays regarding any agreement struck, other than Brightline fulfilling it's original commitments, as opposed to weekends where the frequency of use of the Brightline will be much lower but boat traffic and community use will be at it's highest. 

Comment #3: The largest item that will be affected as a result of your upcoming decision & will have bigger implications than you realize is the impact this will have on the value of our homes in the community as a result of big business. 

You will no longer be able to attribute the type of access we currently enjoy with owning a home in our community. You will essentially be creating a bifurcation line of true open water access vs. restricted open water access if you bend to the whims of what big business like Brightline is demanding we provide as a community. This is an accommodation that only benefits their larger interests, rather than going back with a counter-demand or a judgement reflective of what we’d like to see as the community, which is that they honor their original commitment to modernize the bridge to allow us safe passage as they operate their business. 

Any adjustment that materially alters the current construct of our access will have far-reaching effects that, with all respect, your organization should not be shouldered with. Give Brightline a reason to rethink backing out of their original commitments and provide them a small window of time to operate. don't let big business impose itself on our rights as taxpayers to enjoy access to our waterways.

The current running through there is strong and the path is narrow allowing only 2 smaller vessels or 1 large vessel to pass through at a time. This poorly thought out “plan” will cause extreme congestion and a very dangerous situation for all boaters. Our boat is 24 ft with w/twin jet motors..no propeller..meaning the slower we move the less steering control we have. We can fit under the bridge when closed, however in a congested situation it is extremely difficult to navigate. Even out of gear it is constantly moving…think giant 24 ft jet ski. This “plan” will make it where will not be able to safely use our boat on the weekends, which means we can never use it. Why should the citizens of Martin County have to endure this constant drama & headache for a train which we receive ZERO benefits ?

This appears to be an election year ploy for attention by an incumbent congressman who has two primary opponents. First, we already did this comment review in 2014, and again in 2018(another election year!).  How many times are you going to spend our money doing this? Secondly, the Martin County commissioners have already negotiated an acceptable bridge opening with Brighltine in 2018. See below excerpt from the court settlement agreement for court case UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, Case # 1:2018cv00333. Just follow what the local county already negotiated with the train company. There is no reason to allow a congress member to overstep our local officials.

(c) Subject to FECR's and USCG's concurrence, Brightline agrees to a USCG operating rule that requires the St. Lucie River Bridge be open to marine traffic at least fifteen (15) consecutive minutes at a set time each hour between the hours of 6:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m ..
and open to rail and marine traffic, as applicable, on an as needed basis during the remaining times, with the openings and closures to be equally divided between the rail and the marine traffic during each of the following four (4) hour periods: 6:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m., 10:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m .. 2:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m., and 6:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m.

You may also be interested to know that two new dry stack marinas are being built east of the bridge that have the capacity to absorb the boats that are stored west of the bridge. Boaters will have a choice as to which side of the bridge they keep their boat. The west side will have a schedule as agreed by the Martin County Commission, and those who choose the new marinas will not go under the bridge.

Brian Mast is using your agency and taxpayer funding to ""campaign"" under the guise of soliciting bridge comments.  Mailers, texts, emails; we've been inundated with Brian Mast bridge stuff.  Enough. It's certainly unethical and should be illegal.

Let's stop wasting time and money. Stick with what the local government negotiated.  

Brian, why don't you actually do something useful, like make the train people build the higher bridge they promised.  That would be helpful.",,,,,,,

The Greater Miami Chamber of Commerce has been working on infrastructure development in South Florida since our founding in 1907 when we were incorporated as the Board of Trade with the mission to build a harbor for Miami. Since then, we have worked with all industries, especially those related to transportation and travel, so critical to our economic engines of tourism and trade. Of course, we have had a deep connection with the Coast Guard as well.  To this day, we play a key role in orienting and connecting the Coast Guard’s new officers and personnel to Miami to ensure their tour of Miami is enjoyable and productive.

This letter supports Brightline’s intercity passenger rail service that will connect Central and South Florida. Florida is leading the country with record population and economic growth. This has limited and overburdened our already congested highway systems, and transportation alternatives like the one that Brightline brings are essential to the maintenance of that growth and the free flow of commerce and travel within South Florida. 

This privately funded transportation system has created jobs, generated new tourism, and spurred economic opportunities while removing cars from the often-gridlocked roads – and it’s only operating in South Florida. The statewide impact when service begins to Orlando will be even greater. 

We are most thankful for the service and security USCG provides our community and our country. Please know that the Greater Miami Chamber supports all of Florida’s industries, including the recreational and marine industries. We strongly encourage the USCG to ensure the needs of both industries are met and Brightline’s passenger train service is not negatively impacted. 

Thank you,

I frequently use the waterway under the bridge, every week and I will be directly affected by any changes. We are a fishing family. 

When we need to wait for the Railroad bridge to open there is always a line up of boaters on both sides waiting to get through the small and already congested area. We typically wait 20-40 minutes with boaters lining up on both sides. I have seen up to 20 boaters waiting on 1 side. Not good. 

When I moved to Palm City, Florida 5 years ago , I had specific criteria for the location. My husband and I wanted easy access to the Ocean. If the Railroad Bridge is not kept open to boaters, my quality of life using the waterway will be severely impacted. Also, I am very concerned about the value of my property on the water and access to the Ocean.

I am also concerned about safety. I thought that a new Railroad bridge was supposed to be built. Why is this train not traveling inland?

I am concerned about the proposed railroad bridge operation procedures being considered for the St Lucie River waterway under the FEC tracks at Stuart, FL.  Below are my answers and comments regarding safe and responsible operations of this critical waterway and bridge operations.
1.  I am a boater living in Palm City and use the St Lucie River Waterway under the FEC tracks in Stuart on a regular basis.
2.  Over 26 years I would estimate passing thru this waterway to downtown Stuart and ocean access an average of 2 to 3 times per week.
3.  When I have experienced railroad bridge closure delays they typically last 10 to 15 minutes.
4.  I truly believe the only practical way to greatly increase bridge closures and maintain safe passage for boaters is with a FIXED opening time the railroad will adhere to and boaters can count on the waterway to be open.  If the bridge was assured to be open for boat passage for 10 minutes on the hour and half hour each day I believe this would avoid any serious safety issues for boaters and keep marine usage of the waterway safe and available on a fixed schedule.
5.  This is a narrow boat passage and can be tricky when strong currents and/or wind is present, both common here.  If the bridge is closed 45 minutes at a time boats will be backed up in both directions and with anxious boaters trying to get thru this narrow passing in a short timespan - surely bad things are going to happen.
6.  The 15 minute each hour opening proposed by the railroad, with no fixed opening time - will lead to marine problems at this location without any doubt in my mind.
7.  Having the DOT Dixie Hwy bridge open at the same time as the railroad bridge makes sense.  Far fewer boats are impacted by the DOT bridge - but even with that it will get everyone thru the passage on a fixed schedule so both marine and railroad traffic know what to expect.
8.  This single track passage over a 100 year old bridge for what is being proposed by Brightline is a major design flaw to their infrastructure.  Replacement of this bridge should have been part of making this proposed track utilization thru this area safe and efficient.  Only a FIXED opening schedule will avoid calamity.  And someone will need to police this with FEC/Brightline.  If not they will open/close as they please and bring on the dangerous situation we all want to avoid.

dangerous. Also as everyone is aware very violent thunderstorms pop up unexpectedly in the summer and boats need to get to safety quickly.

The issue we face is unlike our European counterparts, our rail system runs through towns rather than around them through the less populated countryside.  The proposed change to the RR bridge schedule on the Stuart bridge will be a danger to the health and safety of the thousands of boaters that use this waterway on a daily basis.  To understand the impact, go to the bridge on a Saturday afternoon and watch the boat traffic traveling under the bridge.  It is looks like an ant trail populated by boat of all sizes captained by boaters of all skill levels.  On the best day, with three bridges in a row it is a challenge.  Place a 45-minute stopper in the mix and you have a recipe for disaster.  It will not be a matter of if a fatality will occur, only when.   This says nothing about the economic impact on local real estate values, the survival of small businesses in our area and the quality of life that has attached us all to such a beautiful state.  If we choose to bear this burden, we gain nothing except delays on our streets and waterways.  When we travel, we use one of the many excellent roadways already in place.  The only benefit I see is to provide a handful of tourists a means of transport from Disney to Miami.  

(1) Do you currently transit through the FEC Railroad Bridge?
Yes, my family and I transit through the referenced bridge at least two times/week to enjoy our area and to support local restaurants and businesses.  

(2) How often do you transit this waterway?
At least twice per week.  Our home is West of the bridge, this is the only passage to access recreational areas and restaurants.

(3) If railway traffic impedes your navigation of this area, how long?
When the train is issue free, we are typically delayed from 30 to 45 minutes, longer in the evenings.  

(4) How would you propose to regulate traffic ?
My first proposal, is to route the rail system on the CSX tracks west of the populated areas, eliminating the discussion entirely.  If the rail must go through town, I supported the 2019 decision by Virgin Rail/Brightline to replace the 100-year-old rail bridge.  By replacing the bridge and raising the height of the span, we could accommodate both the rail and most boating traffic in our area.  In the event this is not possible, scheduled openings which are known would be helpful.    The proposed 15/45-minute split should be reversed in favor of the marine traffic.  If this is not possible, allow greater rail access during the week and marine access on the weekends and holidays when we have the most recreational boat traffic.  

(5) What challenges have you experienced?
This area is hazardous now with three bridges in succession.  Even with the bridges open, it creates a bottleneck for marine traffic.  When the rail bridge closes, you put a cork in the bottle, making passage worse.  With the proposed change and the resulting extended delays, I cannot imagine the concentration of these hazards in a narrower window.  I would not be surprised on a weekend if marine traffic would not be cleared before the small 15-minute window closes.  I further foresee this being compounded by boaters racing to “make the bridge” so they will not be faced with another 45-minute delay.  This proposal will create a situation that will result in death and/or serious injury.  

(6) What frequency and duration should the bridge open?
The proposed 15/45-minute split should be reversed in favor of the marine traffic.  If this is not possible, allow greater rail access during the week and marine access on the weekends and holidays when we have the most recreational boat traffic.  
(7) Should Dixie Hwy Bridge opening mirror the operating schedule of the Railroad Bridge?
With the higher clearance of the Dixie Hwy bridge, the percent of vessels that require the opening of both bridges is significantly smaller.  I would think this bridge can be scheduled to open for less time than will be needed for the low clearance of the rail bridge.   With that said, consideration will still be required to accommodate the larger vessels and those with higher bridges and masts.  

We who have called the Treasure Coast home for decades have had to deal with the poor decisions made by the Army Corp to discharge Lake Okeechobee into the St Lucie River, and all the negative impact it has had on our environment.  By allowing increased rail traffic, I only see traffic jams in town, marine vessels delayed around our bridges all creating risk to all of us, with no reduction in the amount of vehicle traffic to offset the increase in risk.  In the name of progress and protecting the environment, and I hope the USCG does not add another chapter to the destruction to our waterways.

It is my opinion that if the railroad bridge is closed for extended period (45 minutes per hour) you will be creating a hazardous situation for maritime traffic.  The currents in this area can be very strong and less experienced boaters, boaters new to the area or even commercial traffic pushing a barge could find themselves in trouble with boats stacked up in both directions waiting for the railroad bridge to open.  This is a very busy area, particularly on weekends and holidays.  I recommend 20 minutes per hour for the railroad bridge to be closed.

If Brightline gets what they want and boater accident rate at this choke point goes up, it will be extremely difficult to change regulation for a more saner operation.
  At the very least Brightline needs to have a bridge tender at the bridge 24/7 to keep bridge open until a train is on its way.
  I would like to know if the USCG Miami commander has actually gotten out of the office to observe the situation first hand. That is part of the job of a Commander. Hopefully the situation will come under close scrutiny and decided in the boaters favor.

I am commenting on the Drawbridge Operation of the Roosevelt Bridge in Stuart, Florida. 
Please seriously consider longer per hour openings of the rail tracks at Roosevelt Bridge.  You will receive numerous pictures from other commentors to this Proposed Rule and I URGE you to please, please, please witness this for yourself. If you cannot do this in person, please consider viewing Body Cams from local law enforcement.  You will see the absolute chaos that occurs on either side of the tracks...especially on the East side of the tracks...ESPECIALLY on a holiday. You will see that having a track opening for only 15min/hour will be a complete disaster.  There will be boaters that will be jammed into an aggressive and perhaps even a hostile envirnoment of multiple boats of various sizes jockeying for passage in a tight area WITH a time constraint. 
As an avid boater that lives on the west side of the tracks, I am extremely worried about the safety of myself, my family and of course all other boaters. Your recommendation matters! Side with safety!  Allow 50/50% openings.  30 minutes/ per hour is the very minimum.

Currently, when waiting for the bridge to open I experience other vessels waiting also. On the east side of the bridges, vessels lose room to maneuver against the current as more vessels approach. A large vessel can be the first to arrive, and then soon after, that vessel will be surrounded by many smaller vessels and the larger vessel then has less room to avoid collision. At times there will be 1 to 12 vessels on the east side and 1 to 6 vessels waiting on the west side. All vessels range from 18' to over 40' commonly. Note: There are many larger vessels that transit this waterway every day. Once the drawbridge opens, most of the waiting vessels start moving towards the bridge immediately. At this time the channel between both drawbridges become very congested and many times too dangerous to proceed. Wide vessels such as and not limited to catamarans are commonly using this waterway and meeting them in this area becomes too dangerous to navigate. When the channel is too dangerous to navigate, many vessels are forced to wait which prolongs the time needed for the drawbridges to be open. This causes many vessels to continue making way after the bridge tender sounds the alarm notifying vessels that the draw bridge is closing. This scenario becomes problematic for the bridge tenders. They are facing a possible collision with the bridge and vessels still making way under the bridge or approaching at a close distance. At the same time the tenders know there are approaching trains. I strongly feel bringing the schedule for openings less than the current schedule well cause more unsafe congestion. Shortening the openings schedule will cause accidents. Accidents in a small area with very strong current and many obstacles impeding any efforts for rescue by untrained bystanders.    Please also note that this bridge is part of the Intra-Coastal Waterway System and should not be made less safe merely for the benefit of Brightline and freight trains at the expense of public safety.    The train companies should build a tunnel or make other arrangements rather than close off access to vessels.",,,,,,,

(2) I transit this waterway 2-5 times a month.
(3) I have been delayed for over 30 minutes and unable to transit waiting for one or more trains.
(4) The RR bridge needs to be rebuilt at a higher elevation allowing a large percentage of boats currently locked out when the RR bridge is closed.  The bridge needs to remain open when there is not a train approaching, i.e. the ONLY time it should be closed is when a train is approaching.   There should be a clock/timer on both sides on the bridge informing boaters when the bridge will close or open. 
(5) The passage under the RR bridge is extremely narrow and difficult for 2 boats to transit at one time.  This 'bottleneck' for safe passage of boats under the RR bridge could be remedied with a new RR bridge with a wider passage area.  The existing narrow passage means that the RR bridge needs to be open for extended times so boat traffic can transit in one cycle, i.e. not have to wait for another opening. 

(6) The bridge should be closed no more than 15min at a time and only once per hour. 
(7) Should the SR 707 (Dixie Hwy) Bridge opening schedule mirror the operating schedule of the FEC Railroad Bridge? The SR 707 bridge and RR bridge schedule needs to be coordinated.  There is no sense opening the SR 707 bridge if the boat can't get under the RR bridge.  ",,,,,,,

Why would I pay a premium price for my new location?
Because I enjoy sailing, boating and fishing.
The waterways in Stuart are perhaps the best in our state for these avocations.
Having passed thru the Railroad Bridge location literally Hundreds of times over the years, I can assure you that even the present operation has caused some serious problems over the years.
I have seen times when several boats were waiting on each side when the railroad bridge reopened. Times when a slow barge or even several sailboats were waiting access that took as long as 30 minutes to clear all boat traffic. I’m sure that if any records are kept by the Highway bridge tender this could be verified. That will be nothing compared to the PROBLEMS THAT WILL RESULT if your proposal is enacted.
The Coast Guard’s proposed new regulations for the Railroad Bridge will not only severely restrict the ability to enjoy the waterways in this area but will virtually destroy waterfront Real Estate values. 
I have been a Real Estate Broker in Florida since 1980. With that experience I can assure you that the value of Waterfront property west of the Railroad Bridge will be diminished by 25% under your proposal.
Some experts in the area say values will be impacted even more than that. 
Hundreds of millions of dollars will be lost to residents of Martin county as well as millions of dollars of Tax base will be lost to the county.
It’s difficult for me to understand how anyone can favor ONE PRIVATE, FOR PROFIT CORPORATION (BRIGHTLINE) over thousands of people that will be Negatively impacted by the present Coast Guard proposal.
I understand that BRIGHTLINE initially discussed a new bridge but backed off those plans.
Even if they agreed today to build a new bridge, it would probably be more than 5 years until completion.
Even if that were the case I understand they would look to the Government for some financial assistance. (That’s us, the taxpayers). Under any solution to their problems, it appears we, the local residents will suffer and have absolutely NO POSITIVE BENEFITS. 
Over the past 25+ years, hundreds of millions of dollars have been invested in Martin County to build 6 or 7 new high rise highway bridges to benefit motorists and protect the waterways for our residents. This Coast Guard proposal only benefits BRIGHTLINE.
With respect to all of the above, I feel the present proposal is the exact opposite of what it should be. 
The residents of Stuart should have 45 minutes of every hour, leaving 15 minutes of every hour to the new investor in this area (BRIGHTLINE).  We were here first with our substantial investments that should not be impacted by the new kid in the area with no positive benefit to us.
Please Coast Guard protect our waterways and our investment.

The proposal to block the Atlantic Ocean’s gateway to the Gulf of Mexico and vice versa for at minimum 45 minutes out of every 60 minutes is a gross mistake.  If this proposal is passed to allow for the Florida East Coast (FEC) Railway bridge to be down, there will be devastating impacts to the Marine Industry, Commercial waterway construction and watercraft, and Recreational watercraft. 

The St. Lucie River’s connection to Lake Okeechobee and the Caloosahatchee River to Fort Myers, is the only pathway from the Atlantic Ocean to the Gulf of Mexico and vice versa. If not for this path an additional hundreds of miles of travel around the peninsula of Florida would be required.  

The impact of the FEC bridge being closed would also include the following:
-	Increased carbon footprint for the marine industry as watercraft would be required to spend more time waiting for the bridge to open, thus running their engines while either waiting for the bridge to open or to proceed around the peninsula of Florida,
- Lack of ability to provide for watercraft rescues for accidents that occur west of the FEC Railroad bridge,
- Many activities, such as waterskiing and wake boarding, occur in the southfork and northfork of the St. Lucie River.  Accidents do occur and boaters will lack the ability to get to Martin Memorial Hospital by boat in a timely manner.
- Fishing accidents can also occur as well as alligator bites that need emergency attention.

Commercial and Recreational watercraft will aggregate east and west of the FEC Railroad bridge in an effort to pass through the already narrow bridge opening in a 15 minute span.  The following will occur:
o	Watercraft will rush from both directions to get through the bridge so that they do not have to wait for the next opening,
o	This rush of traffic in both directions, in an already narrow passage way, will create an unsafe environment for all watercraft and its passengers,
o	Watercraft will cram through the openings where the opportunity for each watercraft to bounce off of each other and into the walls of bridges will create unnecessary chaos and an increase for potential injuries.

In addition, commercial waterfront restaurants and businesses will be impacted as boaters will decide to not visit these establishments via waterway as it will not be economical and too time-consuming to wait for the bridge to open and plan accordingly to avoid long waits.

That is what my experience has been even without the proposed closure for 45 minutes of every hour! I have lived here full-time for 5 years on the North Fork of the St. Lucie River and I fish the ocean frequently during all seasons requiring passage through the railroad bridge area. 

I am extremely concerned about my, and my friends and neighbors' ability to reach the ocean or the sandbar in a timely manner. Another major concern is the effect this will have on my property value given my fairly recent purchase and recent renovation. The change to the train bridge schedule would ruin the waterfront value of the property because of an uninformed decision made by someone who must not understand water access interrupted by train travel through the area. 

Why is this train not going through the Okeechobee area on tracks that don't interfere with coastal water usage, far more necessary to Florida living than a train to Orlando from southeast Florida? This is callous and crazy thinking by uninformed politicians! ",,,,,,,

1) I currently transit through this area
2) I transit through this area 1-2x/week
3) Currently, the railroad bridge rarely impedes my navigation.
4) To balance railroad and waterway navigation, the bridge should be down no longer than 10 minutes at a time followed by a minimum of 10 minutes in the open or up position. This would be a fair balance.
5) Have Brightline build the 2 lane bridge (that they reneged on) that has greater clearance so the bridge won’t have to open as often. It’s ironic that this modern high speed rail service is relying on a 1 lane 97 year old structure to meet their needs. What are the contingency plans when the bridge malfunctions in the raised or lowered position?
6) See question 4 
7) The clearance under the dixie highway bridge is greater than under the railroad bridge. Therefore the Dixie highway bridge doesn’t need to mirror the current railroad bridge schedule. 

The waterways in this area are an important part of this economy. We’ve endured many lost summers on the water due to the dumping of lake okeechobee pollutants into this very river system. Now Brightline wants to further limit our enjoyment of the water by severely restricting access to the ocean and Atlantic intercoastal waterways.  Brightline has managed to get everything that they want from the state of Florida and federal government in order to push their product. There is NO benefit to the boaters having Brightline travel through Stuart.  Please consider the negative effects on the local citizens and tax payers prior to changing the railroad bridge operating schedule. ",,,,,,,

People who purchase homes on the water and have boats expect to be able to gain ocean access without serious restrictions and the same goes for boaters who keep their vessels on the west side of the bridge. Why is it ok for the trains to run their routes uninterrupted while boaters are forced to make concessions. As Rep. Mast stated it’s the boaters who have a right of way, not the trains. An ideal plan would be to split the bridge time 50/50 so that everyone has fair access. The coast guard is here to protect our waterways not to bow to the wishes of Brightline and the Florida East Coast Railroad. If these measures, suggested by the US Coast Guard are enacted then you can count on some marina’s shutting down and the local economy taking a major hit. As a family that lives and boats on the St Lucie and owns a local business in downtown Stuart, we can already tell you what a negative impact the rail construction will have on all of the local businesses due to the upcoming crossing closures.

Basically, my opinion based on 65 plus years of boating is that the water was there first and the bridge came after. Boats traveling through should have the right of way. The fact that the bridge is not manned, means at any time the bridge opening can fail and present a hazard to mariners. The bridge should remain open except for when trains must pass. However, since the trains are on a schedule, the railroad people know when the bridge needs to be in place. It makes no sense to do it any other way.  Passing through the RR bridge and the SR 707 must be done at idle speed as required by nav rules. However, some boats actually take more time due to tide and current movement which is always present. When boats are lined up on both sides waiting for an opening, it looks like I95. And like I95 all it takes is a small accident to wrap up drivers for hours waiting for the roadway to be cleared. Rushing through bridges is not safe and restricting the openings as the RR people request will cause accidents and make the area a hazard to navigation. I repeat, there is no need to have the RR bridge lowered until just before a train is due to pass over. By creating a hazard to navigation as the proposed rule is seeking by the railroad, the Coast Guard had best be prepared to answer distress calls which in turn will cause more problems because the bridge has to remain open for marine traffic.

I pass through the railroad bridge weekly. I also drive across the Old Roosevelt auto bridge multiple times a day and am very much aware of the frequency of the trains transiting the railroad bridge both day and night.

The Railroad bridge should be open a minimum of twice each hour for 15 minutes duration each time. Proposed closing of this bridge for 45 minutes every hour is unrealistic and a safety concern for boaters.  Since only a small percent of the vessel traffic can pass under the closed railroad bridge, this will cause a large number of boats waiting for the bridge to open on both sides of the bridge.  The current at this bridge is strong and is difficult for even experienced boaters to maintain position at times. Additionally, when the bridge does open, the narrow span of the train bridge restricts two-way traffic.  The FEC’s proposal of a single 15 minute opening each hour may not allow sufficient time for all boats to pass.  This is a heavily trafficked, high current, confined area especially on weekends. I have had to wait up to 2 hours with dozens of other boats milling around waiting for the bridge to open.

For Palm City, St Lucie County that uses the North Fork and Okeechobee Waterway to the Locks, this is a critical juncture for travel. The optimum solution would be a new double track rail bridge.  With a 16-ft height above the water and a 90-ft span opening, this would allow the majority of the vessels to pass when the railroad bridge is closed.  This would also better facilitate the train traffic, allowing the railroad to use the double track that they are currently laying up to the approach of the north and south side of the bridge. We should not have a choke point at a strategic location on the intercoastal waterway. We can and should accommodate all the modes of transportation at this intersection.

Reponses to requested questions:

(1) Do you currently transit through the FEC Railroad Bridge crossing the Okeechobee Waterway, mile 7.4, at Stuart, Florida?

Yes.  Our residence is located in the Palm City community of Lighthouse Point.

(2) How often do you transit this waterway?

As an average, I would guess we transit this waterway 4-8 times per week.

(3) If railway traffic impedes your navigation of this area, how long are you normally delayed?

It varies depending on the passage of one or two trains at a time.  If it is one train, the delay is roughly 20-minutes.  If there are two trans, we have seen the delay up to 60-minutes.  

(4) How would you propose to regulate the balance of railway and maritime traffic in this area?

Equal time for both railway and maritime traffic would be fair.  There is an existing fixed schedule for the opening of the SR 707 Bridge so a posted schedule for the railroad bridge would also be beneficial, if possible. Consideration may need to be given for longer openings on the weekends than on the weekdays.  Closure of the railroad bridge will definitely pose possible life safety issues if rescue vessels are unable to make passage when there is an issue; boat fire, sinking vessel, etc.

(5) What challenges have you experienced when transiting this area due to these bridges and/or railway activity?  

The longer the FEC Railroad Bridge is in the closed position, there is a build up of boat traffic between the FEC Railroad Bridge and the Roosevelt Bridge (tall bridge).  While the water area is of a fairly sufficient size, we have experienced boat traffic close to 50-boats in the area making it unsafe.  When the bridges are opened, many of the boats begin the ""mad dash"" to get through the opening regardless of who has the right-of-way.  We have seen boat collisions and many near misses between vessels.  With our larger 405 Cruisers Yacht, we have been ""cut-off"" numerous times by smaller vessels trying to get through the bridge openings.  

(6) Is a 15 minute hourly opening schedule sufficient for marine traffic? If not, please explain why.

In my opinion, the answer would be NO.  We have seen it take 15-minutes or more to clear the boat traffic on the weekend from one closure of the FEC Railroad bridge.  

(7) Should the SR 707 (Dixie Hwy) Bridge opening schedule mirror the operating schedule of the FEC Railroad Bridge?  

If the FEC Railroad Bridge is in the down position then there is no reason for the SR 707 Bridge to open.  If you can pass under the SR 707 Bridge but not the FEC Railroad Bridge then there is little area to safely stage your boat until the FEC Railroad Bridge is opened.  It may be important to sequence the opening of the two bridges.  By this I mean if the FEC Railroad Bridge opens (after being in the closed position) small boat traffic should be allowed to pass and clear the waterway before the opening of the SR 707 Bridge for the larger/taller boat traffic.  It becomes difficult and at times unsafe for the passage of the larger boats between the bridges as the smaller boat traffic tries to pass in front of the larger boats as they are maneuvering the passage between the bridges.

To Whom it May Concern,
	I have comments on the rules on a proposed change to the operating regulations for the Florida East Coast (FEC) Railroad Bridge, mile 7.4, and the SR 707 (Dixie Hwy) Bridge, mile 7.5, across the Okeechobee Waterway (OWW), at Stuart, Florida.
	I have an Unlimited Tonnage Masters License, Oceans. I am retired in Stuart, FL after a 45-year career at sea.
	It seems that nobody wants to speak to the commercial disruptions. The OWW which serves as main connector for delivery of vessels from the Gulf of Mexico to the ICW and the Atlantic Ocean would be adversely affected, and the added costs in time and fuel to round the Keys would be punitive on owners and companies.
	In the last few weeks I have seen the bridge stuck in the down position. Twice stuck it was stuck halfway up, which in effect, does not allow for sail vessels passage as well as any high air draft vessel.
	The maintenance on this ancient bridge has been horrible. “Brightline FEC” promised the people in meetings they would put in a new bridge with a much-improved clearance. Of course, as soon as they received their permits, all those promises were dropped. (Obviously hoping for the same mariners they lied to, to pay for a new bridge “sometime in the future”).
	In any case, as the protectors of our nation’s waterways and the safe navigation, you have the responsibility to ensure safe navigation. I have transited these bridges many times. When you create near constant traffic jams on both sides, it is inevitable that collisions will increase many fold, especially when at full ebb and sometimes at full flood. The eddies and swirls are a challenge to an experienced mariner and for the amateurs can be quite scary.
	I transit the bridge often with my 34-foot Wellcraft and Seaward 26 ft sail, about once every 10-14 days. (I transit often to downtown Stuart on my Whaler 13’ but don’t require an opening for that.)
	The problem with the delays is that this bridge is already unreliable. Over the years it has been stuck down for hours several times and that will only worsen with its increased use.
	I have been to more than 100 countries in my career and ridden on a number of high-speed rails. They are always placed inland and never run through every coastal village disrupting marine traffic as well as the civilian life. Using the inland CSX rail tracks would have been perfect for this but we all know FEC has a grip on the state legislature.
	The 15-minute schedule is unreasonable. At high traffic times, the waterway  backups will seriously effect movement. The 15 minute timeframe does not leave enough time to effect safe passage. This will also force the untrained boaters to maneuver in an uncomfortable manner.
	Obviously, the SR 707 bridge can mirror the FEC bridge as it’s the decrepit FEC bridge which is the restricting factor.
	The proper answer would to be to restrict the RR traffic until such time as the “Brightline” puts in the New bridge as promised, that does not have such a sharp impact on the proper commercial and pleasure waterways use. As it stands these important waterways will be closed to all traffic many times over the next few years, but without the FEC standing by its commitment to build the entire OWW will become untenable and too expensive to use.
	Please protect the boaters and mariners as is your charge.
	Regards,CAPT. John Hasson, USMM (ret)

(1) Do you currently transit through the FEC Railroad Bridge crossing the Okeechobee Waterway, mile 7.4, at Stuart, Florida?
Yes. I dock my boat on the west side of the FEC RR/OWW Bridge at my house.  I must transit under the bridge to access the ocean, the ICW and the Indian River Lagoon.

(2) How often do you transit this waterway?
Multiple times per week.  Usually on weekends.

(3) If railway traffic impedes your navigation of this area, how long are you normally delayed?
At a minimum the RR bridge will cause a 30 min delay but its been 1 hr several times.  The bridge has also been down due to maintenance since it is old.

(4) How would you propose to regulate the balance of railway and maritime traffic in this area?
The bridge should be more efficient at raising and closing so that it is not down more than 15 min per hour at a regular time interval.  For example--At the top of the hour it will be open for 45 min and then closed for 15 min at end of hour.  This will allow predictability for boaters that know if they show up at 45 min past the hour it will be closed until the top of the new hour.  This is not just for convenience but for safety.   I have seen boats piling up at the bridge when there is a strong current and it gets dangerous.  This is especially true for boats heading west.  Typically they are back from a day offshore and are short on patience or tired.  The boats start getting close and I have almost been hit a few times when people forget the current and start drifting into other boats.
If a  fixed opening time is not established for each hour, then a method of public notice must be established(app, text or web-based) to inform recreational and commercial users of openings.

(5) What challenges have you experienced when transiting this area due to these bridges and/or railway activity?
See above.    I have seen boats piling up at the bridge when there is a strong current and it gets dangerous.  This is especially true for boats heading west.  Typically they are back from a day offshore and are short on patience or tired.  The boats start getting close and I have almost been hit a few times when people forget the current and start drifting into other boats.
(6) Is a 15 minute hourly opening schedule sufficient for marine traffic? If not, please explain why.
NO!  See above. This will result in far too many boats piling up.  Just a 30 min delay on a Saturday could results in dozens of boats getting backed up.  This will be a safety hazard.  
If the trains require the bridge down this often then the bridge needs to be rebuilt so that the majority of boat traffic can go under it. My boat is a 30ft center console and does not need the SR 707 (Dixie Hwy) Bridge to open.  So that same clearance is adequate and would significantly cut back on recreational boat traffic.

(7) Should the SR 707 (Dixie Hwy) Bridge opening schedule mirror the operating schedule of the FEC Railroad Bridge?  
Not necessary if using the schedule I proposed.  That can still be by request.

Returning home from the fireworks, as everyone is in line to go under the bridge (after the bridge had gone up 15-20 minutes prior, boaters we’re getting annoyed with the pace of the progression under through that area. Boats were passing those of us in line and some belligerent. More than 3 boats passed the line as though they were entitled to pass more quickly. One assumed we had to wait for the street bridge but the other 2 were inconsiderate & entitled and at times words were exchanged.

Yes, we have a powerboat and a sailboat on the South Fork of the St Lucie river

(2) How often do you transit this waterway?

More often in the summer but every month

(3) If railway traffic impedes your navigation of this area, how long are you normally delayed?

I haven’t actually timed it but it seems fifteen minutes is conservative

(4) How would you propose to regulate the balance of railway and maritime traffic in this area?

Stuart has a long history as a maritime community. It is a premier destination for boaters and a stop for many who cross the Okeechobee waterway.  The railway needs to recognize this maritime inclination and not destroy this waterfront community.

(5) What challenges have you experienced when transiting this area due to these bridges and/or railway activity?

The waterway is narrow at this point. Boaters are jockeying for position on the west side between the docks and the NW point and to the east between the shoals and the marina, often while dealing with a strong current

(6) Is a 15 minute hourly opening schedule sufficient for marine traffic? If not, please explain why.

When the big Roosevelt bridge was completed, we were informed that the low Roosevelt bridge would always open on demand. I understand that the repairs to the big Roosevelt bridge necessitated an opening schedule for the low Roosevelt bridge but when the repairs were completed, the low bridge should have returned to on demand. It isn’t always easy maneuvering with a powerboat through the narrow waterway with the two bridges but with a sailboat, it often becomes quite difficult. Motor boats of all sizes race to beat us after waiting for the bridge to open, leaving us to deal with large wakes as we traverse through the narrow bridges. On holidays or weekends, even with the more frequent openings (every twenty minutes vs the 45 minute wait you are contemplating) boat traffic becomes heavier making it even more difficult to maneuver our sailboat. An opening once an hour for fifteen minutes is ludicrous when you consider all the boat traffic trying to clear these two bridges at once 

(7) Should the SR 707 (Dixie Hwy) Bridge opening schedule mirror the operating schedule of the FEC railroad bridge?

As the railroad bridge is lower than the low Roosevelt bridge, this question is not necessary. Boats can’t transit through this area if the train bridge is down so the low Roosevelt bridge would have no choice but to mirror the train bridge’s opening schedule


If Brightline was to put a station in south Stuart or Hobe Sound, the trains would stop there thereby making it easy to project when the railroad bridge would need to be closed. Choosing an area to the south would ensure that the trains are up to speed when crossing the waterway which would minimize the time required for the crossing. Being able to leave the train bridge up the rest of the time would be a huge boon to the existing maritime community.",,,,,,,

The St Lucie Railroad Bridge should not be in the down position for most of each hour of the day. The proposed Brightline trains are so fast, right? Then they can get by quickly within 10-15 minutes and then the bridge can go back down for nautical needs. There is so much (personal and commercial) boat traffic that needs to go back and forth at that point and they have to carefully and slowly navigate wind, current, other boats, wake and waves from other boats that anything less than 45 minutes for the many boats to go through the opening safely is unacceptable. The first quarter hour could be devoted to the train(s) and the remainder of the hour could be for nautical traffic. Not to mention, the boats have two bridges to navigate at that point and boats are going in both directions, but there’s only enough room for one boat at a time going in either direction (east or west) to go through the opening safely. One does not want to be pressured into a narrow window of time in a narrow passageway and potentially crash into other boats. What a mess that would be. And it would be the fault of the train company and coast guard for not allowing enough time for safe crossing of boat traffic. It’s bad enough waiting on a train to cross when one is on land in their automobile, and traffic gets backed up. But the scenario created by making boats wait for a train bridge to go up for long periods of time is a real nightmare in the making due to the reasons stated above. I can only imagine the number of lawsuits that would be filed for potential boat damage and God forbid, fatal accidents. ",,,,,,,

Yes, very frequently.

(2) How often do you transit this waterway?
at least 2 times in each direction.

(3) If railway traffic impedes your navigation of this area, how long are you normally delayed?
Currently, delays have been about 15 minutes to lower the bridge, have the train pass, and raise the bridge.

(4) How would you propose to regulate the balance of railway and maritime traffic in this area? This is a public waterway, used by both pleasure craft and commercial vessels.  It needs to be kept open at least 50% of the time, and never closed back to back (i.e. open 1100-1130, closed 1130-1200, closed 1200-1230, open 1230-1300.

(5) What challenges have you experienced when transiting this area due to these bridges and/or railway activity?

I generally already have to wait for the bridge once or twice a month.  If the bridge was on a schedule instead of on demand, I could time my transit from my dock to the bridge.  Returning from a day of fishing would be a different story. Both bridges are too low.  the federal standard is 25' if I recall correctly.  These bridges are at 6-7 and 12' clearance when closed.  My boat is 11' above the water line.  On a king tide I have had occasions where I could not pass under the highway bridge.

(6) Is a 15 minute hourly opening schedule sufficient for marine traffic? If not, please explain why.
No.  The bridge opening and closing needs to be on an equal basis for boats and trains.  30-30 would be acceptable as long as the railroad bridge is not closed back to back (30-60-30).

(7) Should the SR 707 (Dixie Hwy) Bridge opening schedule mirror the operating schedule of the FEC Railroad Bridge?
To be honest, that bridge should be dismantled.  The newer Federal highway bridge has plenty of capacity to handle increased car/truck traffic.

These questions do not accurately display all of the potential issues.  For example, if the bridge is down and boats are stacked up on either side.  Go look at it on a nice sunny weekend and even now it is overcrowded.  Then imagine a thunderstorm pops up.  Boats would be trapped on the east side of the bridges, causing a hazard.

The railroad bridge was supposed to be replaced.  Brightline should not be able to  ditch that plan because of cost or land issues.  They signed on to it knowing full well that they would bypass it.

A non-bridge issue has to do with trains passing through Stuart and PSL in very close proximity to businesses and homes. The proposed schedule for Brightline shows 18 trains per day.  This will cause major traffic issues as well as public safety issues.  A better solution is to run the tracks on the west side of the St Lucie river.  This area is scarcely populated and would not infringe on any navigable waters.

Additionally, closure of the bridge will affect marine related businesses on both sides of the bridges.  In an already fragile economy, we can't take the risk of putting these companies out of business.

Lastly, there will be a huge effect on property values if the bridge closes as planned.  I for one bought here because of the access to the ocean after passing under the bridges.  I paid a lot of money to have that access.  When I was in the process of buying last year, I called the CG Miami District and spoke to someone in waterways.  I was assured that no major closures would occur from with the railroad bridge being closed or the construction of the new bridge.  Had I known of this potential situation, I would have bought elsewhere.

I am a recreational boater living on the north fork of the St. Lucie river.  I transit the subject waterway regularly, and have observed that when the railway bridge is down for approximately 20 minutes (as is usually the case now), large groups of boats accumulate on both sides of the bridge, and there is sometimes confusion and conflict among them, jockeying for position when the bridge reopens.  I believe that closing the bridge for longer periods of time would create safety risks, while causing boaters to burn more fuel to maneuver while waiting.  

I believe that the bridge should only close for the minimum amount of time required for trains to safely pass, and that a new railroad bridge should be built to remedy these problems.

One, albeit more personal, is the nuisance of the current bridge openings.  To think the timing will be more restrictive is outlandish.  However, the main reason this change should not go forward is SAFETY.  I would imagine there could be dozens, if not over one hundred, boats waiting for an opening if only once an hour.  Forget the timing and logistics of allowing all that want to pass do so, but if you add some adverse weather, strong current and a holiday into the mix, there will be disasters.  I wouldn’t want that liability on my conscience.   So please don’t let it be on yours.

In terms of suggestions, other than the obvious to route the train traffic west paralleling Route 95 (I know this is off topic for this ruling, but how this happened is a mystery to me), would be to communicate the current train schedules on an app or web site.  In this day and age, I am sure a technical solution could be created to communicate schedules to boaters allowing them to plan around.  Have the companies profiting from using the bridge - who are disrupting our lives and safely - fund it.

Like most center console boats, I can pass under the car bridge when it is closed but not the train bridge.  The road bridge opens on demand so it can accommodate those large boats that require both bridges up at the same time. Virtually every boat with a T top must wait for a train bridge opening. 

I fish the ocean weekly, sometimes more, weather permitting, and have been stuck for up to 30 minutes on several occasions.  While inconvenient, for the most part (exceptions below) these delays have been manageable.  These delays have been primarily between 6:30 and 8:00, when most fishermen head out.  

I understand once high speed rail service begins the bridge opening will change to 15 minutes an hour during daylight hours.  That amount of time is NOT sufficient and will result in dangerous boating conditions.  There are thousands of boats and  a major boat yard west of the bridge.  And there is commercial freight traffic to and through the Lake.  

Apparently the environmental impact statement said two large boats (50 feet) can pass side by side under the bridge. Whoever wrote that has never experienced the wind and tidal impact of passing under the bridge.  At times, it is dangerous for two 30 foot center console boats to pass at the same time.  If a commercial barge is attempting to pass under, no other boats can pass in either direction.  

The real danger will come on busy days (think of those summer weekend days with many boats returning from an afternoon of partying on the sand bars near the inlet) when as many as 100 boats of all sizes will stack up waiting to pass. If you can imagine the start of a motor cross race, you can visualize what will happen on those days. I have had to participate in this race and it is “white knuckle” experience.  Shorter opening times will only make it worse. Accidents will be inevitable.  All won’t make it through.  So in that case, the wait will become 2 hours, the frustration level will go up and rash decisions are likely to be made to try to get through the next opening, leading to more accidents. 

Another safety hazard occurs during the onset of summer thunder storms.  On a number of occasions we have had to hide under the Rosevelt bridge waiting for the train bridge to open so we could outrun the storm back to our dock.  Being on a boat during a lightening storm is no fun.  A near lightening hit could wipe out our electronics and render the boat uncontrollable.

The boating industry west of the bridge supports many marine industry jobs.  The limited opening time may cause many boat owners to sell or have their boat maintained elsewhere, costing jobs.  The economic impact will be significant.

The St Lucie bridge needs to be considered differently from the bridge in Jupiter, which I understand will be open 10 minutes every hour.  That bridge has no cross state pleasure (think big) yachts or commercial traffic. It has no barge traffic. Further, there is little commercial activity (economic impact) dependent on access.  Also, boaters in Jupiter have an option: they can go south on the inter-coastal waterway to gain ocean access.  Those of us docked on the St. Lucie have NO other option.

So what is the solution? The proposed plan to build a new bridge with 18 feet of clearance would have solved the problem, as all except for mega yachts could pass under without opening. This is far and away the best option for boaters. Why has that plan been abandoned?  Because it costs the Brightline owners money?  How about the cost to boat owners and those employed in the industry?   

The only real solution is for the bridge to be open for longer periods during prime boating times: especially between 6-9 AM and 3-5 PM with longer periods on weekends.  Thirty minute openings (or two 15 minute openings) would be reasonable compromise or two 15 minute intervals every hour during daylight hours. It would seem that this result could be accomplished via scheduling trains to reduce train traffic during these periods.  There has been some news of a retrofit of the existing bridge.  If so, faster opening and closing speed would help some, but probably not much.  

I sincerely hope the Coast guard will exert its influence and require substantially more time when the RR bridge will be open during daylight hours.  ",,,,,,"https://downloads.regulations.gov/USCG-2022-0222-1701/attachment_1.docx",

I am a resident of Martin County and have property on the St. Lucie River west of the train bridge. I have a local business and we have worked hard in this community to build a good life for ourselves. My house and property are major investments for me. This investment, like my neighbors here on the river will be adversely affected by the restriction of boat traffic proposed by Brightline. This train brings no value to our area but only cost us locally by being an inconvenience at best and a danger at worst. 

The railroad  bridge crosses the St. Lucie River and is between us and  the intracoastal and ocean. Part of our lifestyle is boating and we enjoy the intracoastal and ocean,  the bridge schedule will cause adverse impacts to our public rights and safety. We have had the misfortune of catching the bridge down for train crossings on numerous occasion's. When down the process takes up to an hour of waiting and jockeying your boat while drifting with the current. When this happens many boats stack up and have to deal with dangerous conditions while trying to keep your boat in position and off fenders, piles and other boats with a moving current and wind conditions. Once the bridge is up this bottle neck forces many boats to attempt to push through and has the potential to lead to accidents. This is currently unacceptable and this does not even address the schedule proposed by Brightline.  As far as proposed bridge regulations I feel that the bridge should be in a normally open position as it currently is, with Brightline regulated to a fixed publicly noticed schedule. The schedule should have limited times for the down position (8 times per 24 hours with no more than 30 minute down time). The schedule should have limited ability to change so that we can plan our uses around the time the bridge will be down. If we at least know when it will be down we can attempt to avoid this. And no, the idea of the bridge being up 15 minutes each hour is unacceptable and dangerous. If this is an inconvenience to the railroad then they should do the right thing and raise the bridge to accommodate the current and historic uses of the waterway, after all they are the ones looking to change the rail schedule, they should be made to accommodate the existing uses without hindering the community.

I know that this rule is looking at bridge opening regulations, but a taller bridge is what is actually warranted to provide the needed safety for the majority of boats utilizing this river. The approval of the Brightline permit appears to have had little concern for public welfare, property values, safety and our way of life here on the Treasure Coast. I would hope that the federal government will do the right thing and consider these issues and limit the bridge closures before there is an accident along the water way.

Brightline did a presentation at the Martin County board of county commissioner's meeting and outline a proposal that would replace the existing bridge with a double track, lift bridge.  This bridge would increase the navigable channel to approx. 90 feet and have a clearance of 18' above mean high water when closed , as opposed to the current 6 1/2 foot clearance now.  The new bridge would be moved to align the channel with the other two bridges.  The estimate that 85%of boating traffic would clear with the bridge down, as opposed to an estimated 23% presently.

In the meantime, I recommend no more that 30 minutes of closure per hour.

I've been swamped in the ICW with much more water than my bilge pump could handle and nearly sunk once. There are ramps east of the Roosevelt Bridge in Stuart but they are much, much farther away than the canal. As far as equity the legal principle of water traffic having right of way over rail traffic is valid in this case. Also Brightline serves no benefit to residents (boaters or not) on the Treasure Coast. Kindly change the bridge down time so that boaters have at least 30 minutes or more each hour. The trains could run back to back 30 minutes for certain times that could be determined to be less likely to clog the channel by analysis of maritime traffic in daylight hours.

The RR Bridge must be upgraded or replaced to accommodate the increased north south rail traffic with minimal cycle time for openings and closings.

A reliable train schedule must be in place, which also has the north and south bound trains crossing the bridge at the same time, to not further inconvenience resident boaters.

The bridge should be required to remain up at the top and bottom of each hour so that marine traffic has a sure time to cross. There also should be multiple other times within each hour that the bridge remains up. Boaters have the right to know when they have a sure time to cross.

In addition to the severe and unjust inconvenience an hourly bridge opening of just 15 minutes will have on marine businesses and pleasure boaters, a down bridge negatively impacts emergency and governmental services including USCG, FWC and MCSO, as well as recovery and towing services.

1)I personally transit through the FEC Railroad Bridge crossing the Okeechobee Waterway.

(2) As a recreational boater, I navigate this waterway several times per month.

(3) At times, railroad traffic impedes my navigation of this area, waiting 20 minutes or longer burning fuel.

(4) If a railway service operator wishes to alter the current balance of railway and maritime traffic in this area, they should be responsible for improving the infrastructure by by raising the height of the railway to allow most maritime users a passage below; not necessarily below the drawbridge, but somewhere along the immediate area.

(5) Transiting this area already causes wasted burning of fuel at idle and associated pollutants due to the current wait at this bridge for railway activity.

(6) If a railway service operator and their regulator wishes to alter the current frequency and duration of the drawbridge openings, they should first satisfactorily demonstrate to the public why they cannot fund a change to the bridge, including but not limited to elevating the crossing to protect the current balance of marine and rail activity. Otherwise, they must adhere to the current wait times.

If the RR bridge is to remain in the down position, contrary to how it operates up until this proposal, these are the hardships that will be necessary to absorb by boaters:
Transiting vessels on either side would be at risk for higher rates of accidents, injury and death due to the queuing of boats in a treacherous location which contains rapid tide and wind changes.
Vessels returning home would impact water quality from wastes and urine discharge if the vessel is not equipped.
Vessels may attempt to transit beneath the RR tracks at other pilings which may result in accidents to passengers and the vessel.
Larger vessels already que up for the Dixie highway bridge. This proximate bridge, in a down position, would severely impact the vehicle bridge tendering operation.",,,,,,,

The water - and those who use it - have the right-of-way, not trains.

The Coast Guard says that its goal is to provide a “more predictable schedule” for boaters, but I’m worried that “more predictable” is code for “less access.”  For example, forcing boats to use tiny windows of 15 minutes each hour to go under the bridge, while Brightline trains roll through dozens of times per day, is predictable but it’s certainly not equitable.

In my opinion, at a minimum, boaters must have at least as much opportunity to pass as trains.  Anything less is unacceptable.",,,,,,,

Currently the bridge channel in it's current configuration is difficult enough to navigate with moderate boat traffic. It is narrow and the water becomes turbulent and makes it difficult for smaller vessels to maintain a straight heading through the channel without getting tossed around and this becomes a danger of hitting the side channel pilings and wall. However, there is the most important issue of safety regarding the bridge. The Railway bridge is in total disrepair and should be looked at very carefully for structural issues.
The bridge looks like it could come crashing down at any moment. Every time I navigate through this passage I notice that the steel is so rusted to the point of chunks of rusted steel are coming off.
The gear mechanism also looks like it is need of replacement along with corroded wiring and probably almost all of the sensors are close to failure that may cause failure of the bridge going up or down.
Before any decisions are made as to the schedule and timing of bridge openings I strongly request that the bridge be inspected by a outside engineering company as to the safety and functionality of the bridge. These inspection reports should be made public before any passenger service be approved.
In my opinion, the Railway bridge in question needs to be replaced. It is a relic from years past and needs to be totally modernized. The bridge is very low to the waterline when closed and prevents any type of vessel from passing under. If a passenger railway is being put in place there must have been an exceptional investment made. Unfortunately, it seems the bridge was overlooked and it was merely taken for granted that the bridge would just accommodate the passing trains. I am not sure from a structural point of view how many times per day the bridge can be operated on a more frequent basis without some sort of failure or devastating accident that ""will"" occur.
The passenger rail company in coordination with the railway system should explore raising the bridge higher and the channel wider for safer passage. This will certainly allow more boat to pass through while the bridge is down and reduce the amount of vessels that have to wait There is plenty of room to increase the grade from land to the bridge to increase the height and make a new bridge to replace the rusted structure that is doomed to fail one way or another. 
We should all stand up and fight for this option. Let them spend the money for improvements and safety before people get hurt or killed. Let's maintain the beauty of Stuart and get rid of this eyesore and make something we can all be proud of !!!

Norfolk Southern #7 Railroad Bridge
Mile Marker: 5.8
Vertical Clearance (Closed): 7.00 ft.
Type: Bascule
Schedule:
Below is the normal operating procedure.

(1) The draw shall be remotely controlled by the operator at the Norfolk Southern #5 Railroad Bridge office over the Eastern Branch of the Elizabeth River, at mile 1.1, in Norfolk. (2) The draw shall be left in the open position to vessels and will only be closed for the passage of trains and to perform periodic maintenance authorized in accordance with subpart A of this part. (3) Trains shall be controlled so that any delay in opening of the draw shall not exceed ten minutes except as provided in section 117.31(b). (4) Before the bridge closes for any reason, the off-site remote operator will monitor waterway traffic in the area with closed circuit cameras and motion sensors mounted on the bridge. The bridge will only be closed if the off-site remote operator's visual inspection shows that the channel is clear and there are no vessels transiting in the area. (5) While the bridge is moving from the full open position to the full closed position, the off-site remote operator will maintain constant surveillance of the navigation channel to ensure that no conflict with maritime traffic exists. In the event of failure or obstruction, the off-site remote operator will stop and return the bridge to the full open position to vessels. In the event of a failure or obstruction, a bridge tender must be called by the off-site remote operator and must be on-site within 30 minutes of the call to operate the bridge. (6) During closing of the span, the channel traffic lights will change from flashing green to flashing red, the horn will sound twice, and an audio voice warning device will announce bridge movement, then two repeat blasts of the horn will sound until the bridge is seated and locked down. When the bridge is seated and locked down to vessels, the channel traffic lights will flash red. (7) During the open span movement, the channel traffic lights will flash red, the horn will sound twice, followed by a pause, and then five repeat blasts of the horn will sound until the bridge is in the full open position to vessels. In the full open position to vessels, the bridge channel traffic lights will turn from flashing red to flashing green then an audio warning device will announce bridge movement by stating ""œSecurity, security, security, the Norfolk Southern #7 Railroad Bridge at mile 5.8 is open for river traffic""AÂÂ. (8) Operational information will be provided 24 hours a day on marine channel 13 and via telephone (757) 924-5320.

I live west of the railroad bridge and today, there is a system that works (at times there are 20+ boats per opening making it through the railroad bridge and old Roosevelt bridge)  Any ruling to keep the train bridge down and/or only allow scheduled openings is a real detriment to the boating community’s flow through the bridges.  I vote to keep the operations of both bridges as is and not side with Brightline to limit openings.  I respond to your questions as follows:
 (1) Do you currently transit through the FEC Railroad Bridge crossing the Okeechobee Waterway, mile 7.4, at Stuart, Florida? YES

(2) How often do you transit this waterway? AT LEAST 2-3 TIMES PER WEEK.

(3) If railway traffic impedes your navigation of this area, how long are you normally delayed? NORMALLY ABOUT 15 MINUTES.

(4) How would you propose to regulate the balance of railway and maritime traffic in this area? ALLOW THE RAILROAD BRIDGE TO REMAIN OPEN UNLESS THERE IS A TRAIN COMING, AS IS CURRENTLY DONE NOW.

(5) What challenges have you experienced when transiting this area due to these bridges and/or railway activity? NO ISSUES ENCOUNTERED WITH EITHER OF THE BRIDGES.

(6) At what frequency and duration should the drawbridge openings occur in order to meet the needs of navigation? THIS IS A PHILOSOPHICAL QUESTION AS DIFFERENT DAYS OF THE WEEK AND TIMES OF DAY ARE CRITICAL. WEEKENDS ARE ESPECIALLY BUSY BECAUSE OF HIGH BOAT TRAFFIC.

(7) Should the SR 707 (Dixie Hwy) Bridge opening schedule mirror the operating schedule of the FEC Railroad Bridge? THAT IS A RHETORICAL QUESTION IN THAT THE TRAIN BRIDGE ONLY CLOSES WHEN THERE IS A TRAIN. MANY BOATS DO NOT NEED THE OLD ROOSEVELT BRIDGE TO OPEN, BUT WHEN THE TRAIN BRIDGE IS CLOSED EVERYONE IS IMPACTED (CAN NOT PASS UNDER AS IT IS TOO LOW AND DANGEROUS).

By keeping the bridge down and only allowing it open 15 minutes per hour would be a very large mistake. 15 minutes is not nearly enough time to move many larger boats through the opening. Large sailboats move a lot slower than power boats. Large boats lined up to access the opening creates a very dangerous situation with novice boaters.  I have seen smaller boats trying to navigate between the larger boats rushing to get through creating a hazardous environment.  Fuel consumption  and approaching storms will also become a situation you will need to keep an eye on.  It is very unfortunate that common sense doesn't prevail and to be pressured by some fighting the economic benefits will prove to be a bad decision as it always is. Sacrificing the enjoyment of boating for so many to create profits for a few.  This issue will go far beyond just the bridge openings.  We will loose a lot of recreational boaters feeling why own a boat if you have very limited access using it to travel east hurting the fishing industry and many fisherman wanting access to the ocean. It may also hurt the businesses that support the boating community west of the bridge. Real Estate values may also come down with less boat owners wanting to live near or on the water with their boats not having more access to the inlet.  How do you measure this economic loss to our community.  When one domino falls there is no telling how many will fall after it.  We need to do the right thing. We have seen numerous deaths on land involving trains. How many will we loose on the water with boaters trying to push to get their boats through the open bridge.  Lets set a precedent and let common sense prevail.",,,,,,,

They cannot be allowed to affect boaters and marina owners and the fishing industry in this way. If so these people and businesses are being denied their rights and should sue brightside or whomever is denying these rights.  The train is already going to cost lives as ambulances lose valuable minutes waiting to cross the tracks while these unwanted trains block access to the hospital numerous times a day. But now it could affect the marine industry and every marinas income on the opposite side of this railroad bridge. Boat owners will leave or relocate. Our boating community will shrink and it will have a huge personal as well as financial impact on this area. This area  thrives because of the two rivers and ocean. No train should take priority over that as its the lifeblood of the area. No one ever wanted this intrusion and to impact the boating and marine industry here is a crime.

The water - and those who use it - have the right-of-way, not trains.

The Coast Guard says that its goal is to provide a “more predictable schedule” for boaters, but I’m worried that “more predictable” is code for “less access.”  For example, forcing boats to use tiny windows of 15 minutes each hour to go under the bridge, while Brightline trains roll through dozens of times per day, is predictable but it’s certainly not equitable.

In my opinion, at a minimum, boaters must have at least as much opportunity to pass as trains.  Anything less is unacceptable.

Three years ago a draw bridge in Port Clinton, Ohio the state decided that the grears for the bridge that crosses the Portage River needed to be replaced. The state found out that no one in the United States had the ability to produce a new set of gears that were required and I believe they finally found a company in either France or Italy they felt were capably to reproduce them. It took around one year to get the gears built and shipped over to the US and delivered to the Bridge in Port Clinton. While the gears were being installed the State found out that the gears were not going to mesh properly! It took them almost a year to correct the problem and delayed the opening of the roadway almost a year! The boaters were lucky that the work had to be done in the open position so they could travel through freely the auto and foot traffic was re-routed for several miles! This was a big mess as Port Clinton is a large tourist town with three jet expresses passenger vessels to Put In Bay in Lake Erie. It also had many Condo's on both sides of the Bridge. I am sure if you would check with the ODNR and the State road Engineerrs in Ohio and the USCG in Marblehead, Ohio they will be able to give you much better details. 
If the old gears of the RR crossing bridge in Stuart would fail or need to just need to be replaced it would be even a greater problem! The current visual look at a bridge that was only built for slow rail traffic will be put to much more stress at ""Speeds in excess of 80 MPH"" per their signs will quickly become a real problem.",,,,,,,

 5]   At times there are too many vessels stacked up waiting for the railroad bridge to open.  Bad weather and limited area around the bridge is quite challenging.
6]   Certainly no more restricted than it is now.

The Coast Guard says that its goal is to provide a “more predictable schedule” for boaters, but I’m worried that “more predictable” is code for “less access.” For example, forcing boats to use tiny windows of 15 minutes each hour to go under the bridge, while Brightline trains roll through dozens of times per day, is predictable but it’s certainly not equitable.

In my opinion, at a minimum, boaters must have at least as much opportunity to pass as trains. Anything less is unacceptable.

No, we will transit the area as we cruise the Great Loop

(2) How often do you transit this waterway?
Once, from West to East heading towards Stuart.

(3) If railway traffic impedes your navigation of this area, how long are you normally delayed?
I have read a lot of the comments,  it seems there is quite the backlog of boats for 20-30 minutes or more. If there is any wind, the ability to control the vessel “while waiting” will become significantly more challenging, especially with a line of boats (on either side of the bridge).

(4) How would you propose to regulate the balance of railway and maritime traffic in this area?
15 Minutes – CLOSED allowing the railroad to operate; 45 OPEN allowing safe passage by boats. 

(5) What challenges have you experienced when transiting this area due to these bridges and/or railway activity?
We all know there is no real “rule” in terms of “waiting in line”, boat operators will take every possible opportunity to “get ahead” in the line. Will the USCG permanently station a rescue vessel and crew on both sides of the bridge; this is an accident waiting to happen. 

(6) At what frequency and duration should the drawbridge openings occur in order to meet the needs of navigation?
15 Minutes – CLOSED allowing the railroad to operate; 45 OPEN allowing safe passage by boats. 

(7) Should the SR 707 (Dixie Hwy) Bridge opening schedule mirror the operating schedule of the FEC Railroad Bridge?  
The FEC schedule for Jacksonville shows “The bridge is left in the open position at all times, unless rail traffic is approaching, and then the span will automatically close until the traffic has passed.”  It would be helpful to have a clear understanding of the anticipated frequency of “use” by the railroad.
How much “warning” would the boating public have in terms of being alerted that the bridge will be coming down ?

Would the bridge tender put out an alert over VHF every time the bridge is being operated which would allow boaters to position their vessels?

It would be far better for planning purposes to know that the railroad bridge is “in use” at specified times, that way the boating public can plan accordingly.

Closures of these bridges often create prolonged waterway closures, mostly caused by sloppy operations of the FEC RR Bridge.  

I am a Florida resident and regular user of the Okeechobee Waterway through the subject draw.  

The FEC RR Bridge is in a generally derelict state of repair.  The draw is narrow, and there are rapid tidal currents that flow in that area.  An onsite bridge tender is not provided at the RR bridge.  FEC RR dispatch office DOES NOT respond to VHF calls to the bridge, so there is no way for users of the waterway.  Although the bridge is supposed to be open when trains are not present, I have found that it does indeed stay closed between trains even when there is plenty of time for it to cycle open before the arrival or another train.  The poor state of repair of the bridge and the inability to contact the RR dispatcher for status information creates potentially dangerous conditions at times, and is very disrespectful of waterway users.  I have been in contact with Ms. Jennifer Zercher of the USCG and Mr. Guillermo Canedo of the Florida Department of Transportation on the operation of this set of draw bridges, but have had no satisfaction for my concerns.  I am still waiting (several months) to hear from Mr. Canedo on my most recent inquiry to him.

I previously submitted the following information in November, 2015.  Since then, I can't see that anything has materially changed in this proposal or in the consequences to waterway users of its adoption, so I herewith re-submit my original concerns.

Freight trains currently use the tracks, and each lowering of a FEC RR bridge closes the waterway for up to 20 minutes, although I have experienced MUCH LONGER closures.  Under the All Aboard Florida passenger service plan, there would be an additional 32 trains per day.  Existing freight traffic would continue, increasing total train traffic volume to 42 - 46 trains a day.    

Many communities along the right-of-way route have expressed objections over the project due to projected delays in fire/rescue response and traffic congestion within their communities.  In light of a recent catastrophic boat fire in the anchorage immediately south of the St. Luce River RR bridge, it's clear that emergency response to marine facilities and incidents would also be delayed by a closed bridge, resulting in great economic loss and placing human lives at increased risk.

According to its website, the Mission Statement of the USCG Marine Transportation System Directorate, Office of Bridge Programs, states: ""To administer the various bridge statutes, environmental laws of the United States, pertinent regulations and policies in a timely, courteous, responsive and professional manner.   This mission will contribute to the development of a safer, more efficient and convenient marine and land transportation system that will effectively utilize and conserve the nations resources in a cost efficient manner, while providing for the well-being, general safety, security, and interests of the citizens of the United States.""  I realize I am a lone citizen opposing huge private commercial interests and the treasury of the State of Florida. But if the USCG Bridge Division honors its own mission statement, my access to, and free use of, the regulated waterways of Florida can be protected and preserved.  I look to the USCG Bridge Division to actually protect my rights and my interests as a citizen.

Closures of the waterway confiscates the right of free passage from citizen waterway users.  I urge that FEC bridge permitting containthe following restrictions:

	1	24/7/365 onsite attendant/bridge tender to control the operation of the bridge,
	2	onsite attendant/bridge tender to respond to radio contacts from vessels via VHF Channels 09 AND 16 relative to bridge operations,
	3	The bridges shall not be closed more than 60 minutes combined for any 120 minute time period beginning at 12:01 a.m. each day, and
	4	The bridge shall remain open to maritime traffic when trains are not crossing.

I further ask that if longer periods of closure are determined to be necessary, that FECI be required to construct and maintain safe docking/mooring facilities, on both sides of and adjacent to these bridges, where boats can find safe moorings to hold against swift currents and inclement weather while waiting for bridge openings, and that bridge operators be financially obligated to reimburse non-commercial, recreational vessels in cases where accidents result because of exceeding the mandated duration of permitted closure.  These large companies must have some binding responsibility to prevent them from ""winking"" and ""nodding"" and ""apologizing,"" but failing to operate in compliance with the rules.

The proposed opening schedule will severely crowd an already narrow and tricky passage when current is ripping through. I worked for a RR up north for 32 yrs and know that it is very challenging to try and change their plans, but this is an absolute must for the safety of boaters. How does emergency personnel, Coast Gaurd, Sea Tow/Boat Us, FWC etc get to the west side of bridge in an emergency situation while the bridge is down? The amount of boats trying to get through the narrow RR trestle in the short time allotted will result in accidents and heightened aggression between boaters that could turn deadly. As it is most boaters do not know the boat moving with the current has ROW which coupled with the excessive boat traffic at this bottle neck will only cause an immense safety issue. In my opinion to rectify this part of the problem, the bridge tender needs to make the announcement of which direction has ROW as pertaining to current. That being only a part of the issue, the RR must amend the proposed schedule, the bridge simply cannot be left in the down position for such a long time. I realize replacing the bridge would be an immense undertaking being that the approaches would have to start elevating at some distance from both side to accommodate a gradual incline, but it can be done, a privately owned RR will not build this unless everyone pulls together and forces their hand. Build a bigger bridge, change the proposed schedule, or build a new line out west away from populated areas, regardless of which option is chosen, one needs to be enacted for safety reasons pure and simple.

I am a resident of seagate harbor I am on the west side of the train bridge. I frequently pass under the bridge by boat at least once or twice a week depending on weather.

This bridge comes down 20 mins. before the actual train gets there. Any chance on narrowing this time down to the actual arrival of the train. 
If the train bridge is down for more time periods it can have a financial impact on the property values west of the bridge.
In the commercial industry dollars are lost as workers sit there on the clock waiting on the Bridge as they are on pay roll. 
As boaters are waiting for the Bridge the water currents are hindering the control of the vessels causing dangerous situations.

close 10-15 minutes prior to and remain closed 10-15 after a train passes.  If the Brightline is allowed an hourly schedule, boaters will have almost no time 
to transit.  With no really good place to anchor  prior the the bridge ( if going West ) and Indiantown Marina the only stop after.  Crossing the lake Roland Martin or Moore Haven are the only options.  The route offers few to none safe places to hold up for trains given wind and weather conditions.  99% of boating hours are listed as sun up to sun down, but in reality most activity is in a more narrow time frame.

In my opinion, at a minimum, boaters must have at least as much opportunity to pass as trains. Anything less is unacceptable.",,,,,,,

Hello;  

As an experienced boater I’ve used the Okeechobee waterway to/from Ft. Myers and Stuart up to 6 or 8 times per year.  

This waterway saves myself and other boaters a lot of time, effort and fuel which equates to money and pollution.  

Most vessels must time their passage across Okeechobee with the scheduled operation of the various locks.  Unnecessary delays can and have caused excessive transit time, fuel use, marina costs and money. 

I have had to wait at the Stuart RR bridge up to 40 minutes when the bridge couldn’t be opened due to a scheduled train passing.  That is acceptable, justified and warranted.  

Having the RR bridge left open for vessel traffic and only closed for trains passing, in my opinion, should be the common sense approach for use of the public waterway and privately owned train operations. 

Thank you for your consideration.  

Regards, 
Capt. Brad

If you have never taken a boat through those bridges you cannot possibly understand the dangers.  There is almost always a strong current, and the passageway is particularly narrow, especially for bigger boats, and most especially at the extremely narrow part at the railroad bridge.  While I am adamantly against this proposal, even under current conditions, which are already dangerous to people and property, the road bridge operator should immediately be given the authority to direct that boats move in batches, either W or E.  ""I am now opening the bridge; the first group of boats which will be permitted to pass through are ONLY the Eastbound boats.  Only when all EB boats have completed their passage, will I authorize ONLY the WB group of boat to proceed.""  ALSO, the local police, the Sherrif's office, FWC and the USCG should have full enforcement authority for boats which violate the rule.  This change would immediately eliminate  the highly dangerous situation where two boats meet head-on in the narrow passages.   Since some small boats do not monitor VHF radio, you should also erect electronic signs at both sides, indicating WB or EB traffic directions.

In addition, Brightline is instituting passenger service between Miami and Orlando which will increase the frequency of trains crossing the bridge.
Brightline is also adding a second rail line (parallel line) south of the bridge and north of the bridge.

This would raise a significant safety concern for boaters that reside on the west side of the bridge.  There is be an increase of boaters driving faster to “make the bridge”, right of way concerns through the bridge span, poor decision by impatient boaters attempting to “get under the side spans” (this is something I observed recently while the bridge was down).  Given the currents in this area, boaters with minimal experience will lose control of their vessels and you could get the bowling alley affect down current.   On a recent outing the rail bridge was down, there was no train, we called the Roosevelt Bridge tender who told us the rail bridge had just gone down and the train was coming soon.  We waited there for 45 minutes and still no train.  In the time roughly 20 boats log jammed on the west side and another 10-15 on the east side.  Two boats with young boats became impatient and attempted to get under the space next to the draw span on the north side.  The first boat made it under barely, the second damaged there anchor light and torpedo rod holder rack on the T-Top.  Should the rail bridge be down for 45 minutes each hour, this type of activity will only increase.  You will have unsafe boating on residential canals with folks “trying to make the 15 minute bridge window”.   There will be an increase in boating accidents and incidents.

January-March 2022 we were moored in Stuart Florida within a half mile of the railroad bridge with an excellent view of the bridge operation. The cycle time of the bridge is 20 minutes minimum from the time of the first warning horn until the bridge re-opens after the passage of ONE TRAIN. The automatic warning horn sounds for 10 minutes prior to the bridge closure, then is is at least 10 minutes for the train to arrive. If there are TWO trains from opposite directions, The closure time approaches 45 minutes!!! When this happens the boat traffic backs up on both sides. The bridge opening is very narrow and strong current allows vessels only one direction at a time. Vertical clearance is very low which forces small boats into the queue along with larger boats. The new Brightline schedule in addition to the freight operations will force the bridge to be closed most of daylight hours.
The only solution that will allow both vessel and train traffic to coexist is to reduce the 10 minute delay between warning horn sounding and bridge closure and the 10 minute delay between bridge closure and train arrival. And that will only happen if automatic operation is replaced with local manned bridge operation. The alternative is to replace the existing bridge with a new span that has TWO sets of tracks and higher vertical clearance to allow better closure time management. FEC and CSX have manned bridges all over. It's time to give up the automatic bridge closure here. Give them a choice, locally manned bridge tender with closure time limits or REPLACE THE BRIDGE with a high speed operating bridge that has higher vertical clearance to pass all of the small boat traffic that has to also pass with the larger boats.

I am also an avid boat operator who traverses under the FEC Railroad Bridge in Stuart on a regular basis. I appreciate the opportunity for the public to provide input on this issue. I understand both the navigable waterway and the railroad have a right of passage through the Okeechobee Waterway in Stuart. With that said, we must find solutions to achieve equitable access for both interests. It is my experience when a freight train approaches the R.R. Bridge it is activated to close way ahead of the train arriving, in case of a malfunction of the bridge, the train requires a great distance to stop. Although freight trains may not be numerous passing this bridge each hour, the length of time that it needs to close prior, and re-open after the train clears the bridge, it is significant amount of time (Total Time of closure plus waiting for the line of boats to then pass single file can be 20 minutes). The Brightline Trains will of course cause more frequent crossings resulting in bridge closure times to increase. The increase of time the bridge cannot be used by boat traffic can affect safety on the waterways and must be prioritized in the decision making process. From a public safety aspect, emergency services to respond for boaters who are having an issue such as loss of power while in a dangerous channel or vessel sinking require response from either Tow Boat U.S. or Sea-Tow which could be significantly delayed based on where those resources are at any time. Additionally, if there is a medical emergency, accident, or fire on a vessel, this can impact timely response of the closest's resources. We currently have some of these resources operating from marinas on the west side of the R.R. bridge that would be unable to respond beyond the Roosevelt Bridge where the most significant need and risk exist. Also, on most weekends when the most activity on the waterway exist these resources are operating East of the R.R bridge and would not be able to respond to any vessels in the Saint Lucie River or waterways all the way to the Lock West of the I-95 bridge. This includes some very large vessels over 100 feet long that are either docked at marinas, fueled, or being serviced. To my knowledge, they only boats equipped with built in firefighting nozzles that can draw water form the waterway are the Sheriff's Office Boats and USCG vessels. All of which cannot fit under the R.R. bridge to respond to an emergency occurring on the west side of the bridge. Land based firefighting capabilities responding to the marinas are only effective as long as the vessel is able to remain secured at the dock. I have experienced several incidents the ropes securing the boat to the dock are burned through causing the boat to float away burning.  There have also been situations people have cut lines and pushed the boats out as they were causing damage to other boats. In these cases a boat with firefighting capabilities must be available to respond by water. There is also the obvious need to reach vessels that catch fire while out in the water.

(1)  Yes

(2)  3-4 times weekly

(3) Twenty (20) minutes

(4) For the time being there should be no increase to the R.R. Bridge being down, while Brightline works to secure funding between them and the FEC Railroad, and or possibly from State and Federal Grants to replace the bridge with one that is even slightly higher allowing a majority of boaters to pass under it. Since that will require years to complete, they will have to operate their schedule to adhere to the current operating times. The current bridge looks like it has more than served its useful lifespan, and could certainly make the list for infrastructure that needs to be replaced by a more modern and reliable one. That is the time to design it with more clearance.

(5) The fact that the R.R bridge is so low most small boats cannot pass under it causing many boats to all circle around on both sides of the bridge in a tight area trying to avoid each other. This is also a problem when boaters are trying to get back to safety to avoid the afternoon thunderstorms and get stuck by the R.R. bridge.

(6)  I do not know the current schedule of freight trains, or the proposed schedule of Brightline trains, but no more than fifteen minutes per hour of the R.R. Bridge being closed seems reasonable.

(7) As long as it is not more than 15 minutes per hour.

Please understand that if my address to this request for information seems to be long winded, but I will endeavor to make my answers as clear and informative as possible. 
Please see below:

(1) Do you currently transit through the FEC Railroad Bridge crossing the Okeechobee Waterway, mile 7.4, at Stuart, Florida? 
No, but will in '23 in an effort to get back to the Chesapeake Bay.

'23 will be our first time.

(3) If railway traffic impedes your navigation of this area, how long are you normally delayed? 
N/A

(4) How would you propose to regulate the balance of railway and maritime traffic in this area?
It would be my thought that a 24/7 posted schedule, to balance boat transitions and needed railway traffic access would be the best approach, if only during a preliminary testing period to establish the needs of both.

(5) What challenges have you experienced when transiting this area due to these bridges and/or railway activity?
No personal experiences, but that said, I would anticipate that one would try to dominate over the other rather than share the facilities.

(6) At what frequency and duration should the drawbridge openings occur in order to meet the needs of navigation?
As scheduled or needed. Who can tell the future?
I would add here that our intended path was never to include Lake Okeechobee and its canals. We had anticipated a trip to the Tortugas and around the Keys, but the saying, 'man plans, God laughs' is very true now for us and Okeechobee has become our path.

(7) Should the SR 707 (Dixie Hwy) Bridge opening schedule mirror the operating schedule of the FEC Railroad Bridge?
Boaters trying to find passage thru bridges will be better served if a staggered schedule were instituted. We own a trawler, that cruises at 8mph, and having 2 or more bridges opening at the same schedule will be a time consuming, aggravating experience trying to get thru numerous bridges.

This waterway is used by recreational boaters, Coast Guard, Marine Patrol, Commercial fishermen and others and SHOULD be open the majority of the time WITH a schedule which includes scheduling the Old Roosevelt Bridge. 15 min an hour is NOT adequate for the amount of boat traffic per hour. It's reasonable to allow half the time or more to boaters and the other half to the trains.

This bridge when the railway closure happens and the boats all must wait for the train to clear (closes 10 minutes prior to trains) and the highway bridge to open creates a bottleneck that is unsafe at best and truly dangerous at the least. This is a very narrow area at the railroad bridge and 2 larger boats cannot safely pass side by side. I would suggest that the persons that will vote yea or nay spend an weekend afternoon on the water at this location on a boat and transit said area during a train crossing. As it is probably cost prohibitive to raise the height of the RR bridge then openings on demand should be a first consideration as the waterway was the original mode of transportation and the RR is NOW changing the game. Perhaps combining the Highway and the train lift operations to the highway bridge operator as many other locals have done, thus saving the extensive pre arrival opening time of the train. This bridge ideally should open at least twice an hour. So perhaps trains on the 1/4 hour and bridge openings for water traffic on the hour and 1/2 hour?

(1) Do you currently transit through the FEC Railroad Bridge crossing the Okeechobee Waterway, mile 7.4, at Stuart, Florida?
Have not done so yet but plan to do so.  Had planned to use it this spring but made other plans because of the maintenance scheduled for January and February.

(2) How often do you transit this waterway?
Starting next fall, 2 or 4 times annually

(3) If railway traffic impedes your navigation of this area, how long are you normally delayed?
Typically, bridge delays have been short, in the range of 10-15 minutes.

(4) How would you propose to regulate the balance of railway and maritime traffic in this area?
Because of the narrow passage and dangerous conditions for 2-way traffic, closure should be held to a minimum.  Automatic closing operations typically require 10 to 15 minutes before train reaches the bridge and several more minutes after passing.  Because of the typical waterway traffic through this narrow area, the time required for an automated system will create a backup of many boats all anxious to get through as soon as they can physically pass.  Very dangerous.  This needs to be a manned and scheduled process, keeping the bridge open until a train is approaching.  Additional signaling and lighting should be installed to enable the operator to safely regulate passage after opening.

(5) What challenges have you experienced when transiting this area due to these bridges and/or railway activity?
I have not yet passed through but it is one of those bottlenecks on the waterway (including the great loop) that is well known.

(6) At what frequency and duration should the drawbridge openings occur in order to meet the needs of navigation?
As addressed in #4, should be managed and kept open unless a train approaches with the clousure kept to a minimum due to the volume of traffic, narrowness of the passage and potential for creating a hazardous condition.  Really, this bridge should be rebuild with wider passage and taller clearance.

(7) Should the SR 707 (Dixie Hwy) Bridge opening schedule mirror the operating schedule of the FEC Railroad Bridge?
This bridge should be rebuild with wider passage and taller clearance or closed entirely with traffic redirected over the New Roosevelt (US 1) Bridge.
It can not be scheduled with the train because the train frequency would not match the highway traffic.

Summary:
Because I plan to use this passage under the railroad bridge in Stuart, FL several times annually I have serious concerns over the proposed changes to it's opening schedule both frequency and duration.  I understand that thousands of boats that transit that passage on a regular basis and to force their passage into a once-an-hour or similar schedule will undoubtable create a traffic jam of vessels waiting on both sided for an opening.  This will result in a very dangerous rush as a mix of speed boats, fast center console type boats, large power boats and slow boats like trawlers and sailboat all vie for the opening.  The rail company shouldn’t have controlling authority in this issue especially considering the safety concerns of the boating public.  It should be their responsibility to make the necessary improvement to the crossing to make it safe for all.  It is taxpayers, not the rail company that are the true owners of the waterway. and should have continuing and safe access to the waterway passage.  Modifications to that right of passage must first consider the waterway's use, the passage of vessels.",,,,,,,

The Old Dixie Highway Bridge operates in cooperation with the FEC Railroad Bridge. Closures of these bridges often create prolonged waterway closures, mostly caused by what I will call sloppy operations of the FEC RR Bridge. 
 
I am a Florida resident and regular user of the Okeechobee Waterway through the subject draw. 
 
To this casual observer, the FEC RR Bridge is in a generally derelict state of repair. The draw is narrow, and there are rapid tidal currents that flow in that area. An onsite bridge tender is not provided at the RR bridge. FEC RR dispatch office DOES NOT respond to VHF calls to the bridge, so there is no way for users of the waterway to get current, reliable information on bridge and train status. Although the bridge is supposed to be open when trains are not present, I have found that it does indeed stay closed between trains even when there is plenty of time for it to cycle open before the arrival of another train. 

Freight trains currently use the tracks, and each lowering of a FEC RR bridge closes the waterway for up to 20 minutes, although I have experienced MUCH LONGER closures. Under the All Aboard Florida passenger service plan, there would be an additional 32 trains per day. Existing freight traffic would continue, increasing total train traffic volume to 42 - 46 trains a day.  Due to the connection of Florida East Coast Incorporated (FECI) tracks with the Port Everglades seaport, and the port's expansion to accommodate Post-Panamax ships, freight volume on the railroad route is also expected to increase.
 
Many communities along the right-of-way route have expressed concerns over the project due to projected delays in fire/rescue response and traffic congestion within their communities. In light of a recent catastrophic boat fire in the anchorage immediately south of the St. Luce River RR bridge, it seems reasonable to conclude that emergency response to marine facilities and incidents would also be delayed by a closed bridge, resulting in great economic loss and placing human lives at increased risk.

According to its website, the Mission Statement of the USCG Marine Transportation System Directorate, Office of Bridge Programs, states: ""To administer the various bridge statutes, environmental laws of the United States, pertinent regulations and policies in a timely, courteous, responsive and professional manner. This mission will contribute to the development of a safer, more efficient and convenient marine and land transportation system that will effectively utilize and conserve the nations resources in a cost efficient manner, while providing for the well-being, general safety, security, and interests of the citizens of the United States.""

In recognition of the fact that closures of the waterway confiscates the right of free passage from citizen waterway users, I urge that permitting of bridges for All Aboard Florida contain, at a minimum, the following restrictions for The New River RR bridge, the Loxahatchee RR bridge and the St. Lucie River RR bridge:
 

24/7/365 around-the-clock onsite attendant/bridge tender to control the operation of the bridge,
onsite attendant/bridge tender to be responsible to respond to radio contacts from vessels via VHF Channels 09 AND 16 relative to bridge openings and closings,
The bridges shall not be closed more than 60 minutes combined for any 120 minute time period beginning at 12:01 a.m. each day, and
The bridge shall remain open to maritime traffic when trains are not crossing.
 
I further ask that if longer periods of closure are determined to be necessary, that FECI be required to construct and maintain safe docking/mooring facilities, on both sides of and adjacent to these bridges, where boats can find safe moorings to hold against swift currents and inclement weather while waiting for bridge openings, and that bridge operators be financially obligated to reimburse non-commercial, recreational vessels in cases where accidents result because of exceeding the mandated duration of permitted closure. These large companies must have some binding responsibility to prevent them from ""winking"" and ""nodding"" and ""apologizing,"" but failing to operate in compliance with the rules.

We are located in large hurricane-protected freshwater basins and connected to Okeechobee Waterway (OWW) on both sides of the State of Florida. RFYC Stuart is located just west of the St. Lucie Lock and RFYC LaBelle just east of the Ortona Lock. Both sites offer convenient access to the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico. 

We have given our customers a safe, secure harbor for storage and/or storm. We are located west of the Florida East Coast Railroad bridge (FEC bridge) and St. Lucie lock. The new regulations on the opening of the FEC bridge will bring a huge impact to our customers who are trying to get their boats to RFYC Stuart for storage. Not only do we offer In Climate Control storage, Dockage, Non-Climate Controlled storage and Land storage, but we also have a Hurricane Membership Club. It entitles them to a secured land storage or dockage during a hurricane storm. 
Public Comment for Docket USCG-2022-0222
(1) Do you currently transit through the FEC Railroad Bridge crossing the Okeechobee Waterway, mile 7.4, at Stuart, Florida? Yes, our customers do.
(2) How often do you transit this waterway? Most of our customers go through it daily.
(3) If railway traffic impedes your navigation of this area, how long are you normally delayed? The delays vary, per our customers. It can be 30min. to an hour, depending if the bridge has just been lifted and how many boats are waiting to get through. And of course, if there’s a mechanical issue, then they can be stuck there for a longer period of time. 
(4) How would you propose to regulate the balance of railway and maritime traffic in this area? We would propose keeping the bridge open for 30 minutes at a time, and have a set schedule for boaters to know approximately what time the bridge is set to open. This way they can give themselves ample time to get to and through the bridge with no delays on their end. Otherwise, there will be too many boats floating, waiting for the bridge to open and this can be unsafe and create many angry people while waiting for the bridge to open.  
(5) What challenges have you experienced when transiting this area due to these bridges and/or railway activity? The safety of boaters is the key thing here. If the bridge is only going to open for 15mins. and closed 45mins., it is going to cause boaters to do whatever they can to squeeze their boats through as soon as the bridge opens. They are not going to want to have to wait for 45 mins. until the next opening. It will cause too many boats floating, waiting to get through the next opening. This is not safe. If boaters are trying to make it across, before a bad storm, and the bridge is down it can be an unsafe situation for the boaters.  Not knowing when or if the bridge is up or down is very uneasy feeling and can put them in a bad situation if a bad/dangerous weather strikes. 
(6) At what frequency and duration should the drawbridge openings occur in order to meet the needs of navigation? If there has to be a time set, then we would suggest to do a trial run of 30mins. It should flow and allow boats through with as little frustration, so they can enjoy their time on the water. Not create frustrations, or havoc.
7) Should the SR 707 (Dixie Hwy) Bridge opening schedule mirror the operating schedule of the FEC Railroad Bridge?  Not necessarily. Every area is different and might need a different schedule in order to have no impact on boaters.

My family personally owns 3 boats from 17' to 34' and uses the waterway on a regular basis 3-4x per week.  It is already difficult to maneuver a large boat in the the small and narrow (both size and water depth) opening and holding areas on both sides of the train bridge.  Boats crossing when it finally opens after a long wait period causes a rush of boats making it even more difficult and dangerous.  This is a boating community and property values are directly related to the water access in our area.  This is also a major thoroughfare and only central waterway access from the west coast of Florida to the east and attracts many large vessels through the passage.  

There were major problems this past 4th of July weekend with extensive closings and more than 30 boats waiting to cross - check with the coast guard radio communication on Saturday, July 2, 2022.  Coast Guard communication were concerning.

Reasons for my request for boaters priority and increase the bridge openings as much as possible is as follows:

Stuart is a long and well established waterfront and boating community.
Property values depend on water quality and ocean access.
Train bridge closings have been well tolerated to date - with the rare exception of trains proceeding in both directions and causing closures of over 30 minutes 
A decreased opening schedule provides ""special privilege"" to one company over the needs of the community.
A decreased opening schedule is a safety issue for boaters especially on weekends/holidays when the boat traffic is at its peak.
This is the only waterway with central access from the west to the east coasts of Florida making it  ""unique"" and we should protect the ""reasonable use of the waterway"".
Large vessels (even barges) use this waterway providing increased safety concerns with more closures.
The train bridge is located right near marinas and provides waterway access to downtown Stuart.  
The train bridge has a narrow opening which at times does not allow two large vessels to pass.
The waters around this bridge can be very shallow limiting the area for waiting vessels.
There is little room for waiting vessels to maneuver on either side of the bridge.
Strong currents, weather and inexperienced boaters causes increased safety issues if the bridge remains closed for longer periods of time.
Currently the bridge closes for quite a long period before a train even approaches.
Increased bridge closings provides unnecessary ""hardship"" for the residents and mariners in our community.
This train bridge is very old and you may need to consider replacement to accommodate increased train traffic for this company. A higher bridge can and would alleviate some of the traffic problems.
The bridge has hanging wires under the entire waterway preventing even a row boat from passing.
Our tax dollars have paid for water access to downtown Stuart and should not be negatively affected by one company's development.
Existing residents and business should have priority over new private business development.
The Roosevelt Bridge was built and designed to increase access to our waterway and new trains should NOT take us backwards.
Train schedule not only affects the waterway but also access to downtown Stuart and a major hospital emergency room.  See attached picture showing train blocking EMS vehicles on Martin Luther King road crossing in downtown - not far from the train bridge on the water..

Keep us moving forward, with increasing property values due to our beautiful water access.  Don't let this train development change our community and keep us on Americas list of beautiful small towns.

Keep the train bridge schedule as open as possible or replace the existing bridge to accommodate boat traffic.  
Thank you.

When Brightline begins its passenger service this fall, these trains will run through Stuart over the FEC Railroad Bridge heading both north and south. When closed, the FEC Bridge only provides 6' of vertical clearance, it must be opened to permit boats to transit from the St Lucie River to Stuart and beyond and the nearby Old Roosevelt Bridge (Dixie Highway Bridge) must be opened to allow most boats to transit the same area.
According to Congressman Brian Mast's office, the bridge handles approximately 20-25 crossings per day, primarily consisting of freight trains, most of which are in the evening. When Brightline becomes operational, it will add 12-14 crossings per day. Currently, the bridge closes 8 minutes before the train is due to cross and opens 8 minutes after it crosses. 
The original Coast Guard NOI proposed a change to allow the drawbridges to operate on a more predictable schedule and asked for public comment on whether a 15-minute hourly opening was reasonable to allow marine traffic to transit the FEC bridge.  The facts are simple, a single 15 minute per hour opening is insufficient for boat traffic, and if adopted, it will clearly cause delays and create a dangerous bottleneck for boaters who regularly transit the bridges. 

The NOI seeks responses from waterway users for the following questions:
1.	Do you currently transit through the FEC Railroad Bridge crossing the Okeechobee Waterway?  YES
2.	How often do you transit this waterway?  DAILY
3.	If railway traffic impedes you navigation of this area, how long are you normally delayed? IN SOME CASES, OVER 90 MINUTES
4.	How would you propose to regulate the balance of railway and maritime traffic in this area?  ON DEMAND WHEN NO TRAINS ARE OPERATING AND AT A MINIMUM, EVERY 20 MINUTES.
5.	What challenges have you experienced when transiting this area due to these bridges and/or railway activity?  IN SOME CASES OVER 90 MINUTES BECAUSE THE DIXIE HWY BRIDGE SCHEDULE DOES MATCH THE R/R BRIDGE OPENINGS.
6.	At what frequency and duration should the drawbridge openings occur in order to meet the needs of navigation?  EVERY 20 MINUTES FOR BOTH BRIDGES.
7.	Should the Dixie Highway Bridge opening schedule mirror the operating schedule of the FEC Bridge?  COMMON SENSE WOULD DICTATE THAT!!!  AND A SCHEDULE SHOULD BE PUBLISHED.

Regarding the reference NOI, the FEC Railroad Bridge located at MM 7.4 of the Okeechobee Waterway and the Old Dixie Highway Bridge located at MM7.5 of the Okeechobee Waterway are significant obstructions to the heavily used St. Lucie River waterway. The Old Dixie Highway Bridge operates in cooperation with the FEC Railroad Bridge. Closures of these bridges often create prolonged waterway closures.  The approach is narrow, and there are rapid tidal currents that flow in that area. An onsite bridge tender is not provided at the RR bridge. FEC RR dispatch office does not respond to VHF calls to the bridge, so there is no way for users of the waterway to get current, reliable information on bridge and train status. The poor state of repair of the bridge and the inability to contact the RR dispatcher for status information creates potentially dangerous conditions at times, and is very unsafe for waterway users.  Please reconsider the proposed changes.

Thank you for your consideration.

The onus falls to the USCG to decide the schedule, and not the AFF. 

The USCG mission: ""...while providing for the well-being, general safety, security, and interests of the citizens of the United States."" The boating world needs the USCG to continue to uphold this mission and not be ""railroaded.""

This conversation regarding the AFF's proposal has been ongoing for nearly a decade (as far as I can tell.) A lot of information has already been provided and discussed.

At the forefront today, is what that schedule should be, and should it be equitable?

Currently, the bridge is OPEN for roughly 40 minutes an hour. It would be foolish to reduce it to only 15 minutes; once you reduce it, you'll never gain it back. The AFF has already stated their plans to expand and extend services; they'll ask for more later and there will be no more to give while the boating industry gave it all away.

While I prefer to be allowed access to (and free use of) the regulated waterways of Florida be preserved, a schedule for bridge operations needs to be specified. I'd prefer OPEN 45 minutes and CLOSED 15 minutes, but that's already compromised by the rail freight traffic.
Therefore, I propose a 15 minute OPEN at the top of the hour, and a 15 minute OPEN at the 1/2 hour to facilitate vessel traffic. 
(Example: OPEN bridge at 12:00, and close at 12:15. OPEN bridge again at 12:30, and close at 12:45.)
I wouldn't give any more time away.

I would also specify a 24/7/365 around the clock on-site attendant/bridge tender to control operation of the bridge.

Here are just a few of my takeaways from all of the studies, comments, experience, and boaters:

*AFF proposed an additional 32 trains/day (for a total 42-46 trains/day), running both north and south without identifying a length of train. 
(Unlikely to meet at any lowered bridge at the same time - a north-bound train could require 15 minutes to cross immediately followed by a south-bound train requiring 15 minutes to cross, immediately followed by a north-bound train, etc)

*Currently, an average of 14 freight trains cross St Lucie bridge with an average closure time of 21 minutes. 
(I'm not opposed to passenger trains, but I am opposed to the amount of time the bridges would be closed for navigation by recreational boats, for commercial barges that already navigate that waterway, and the emergency rescue response. Stacking up the boats will create situations that could result in personal or financial harm.
A closed bridge would require boats to queue; a 45 minute wait time for a 15 minute window is not a safe environment. When the bridge opens, the barges will need time and room; recreational boaters will squeeze through -- what could go wrong? If a bridge is opened to accommodate emergency responders (fire, rescue, tow), expect attempts by boaters who were in the queue to squeeze through -- what could go wrong?)

*The impact study also noted preservation of wildlife with a long list of endangered species and plant life. 
(If boats are forced to wait in an area where previously passage was immediate, how might this adversely affect marine life? Do the manatee's know to move aside? Maybe not the best example, but the study included (as it should) the impact of the marine life, but only from the rail's perspective. It didn't include what impact the boating community would then disperse into the community. Who would then be liable? The rail? The USCG? The individual boater?)

Thank you for the extended time and opportunity to provide comment.
I support Brian Mast, Congressman, in his efforts.
Thank you for your service.",,,,,,,

This will lead to a truly unsafe situation for boaters in that area.  There will be potentially hundreds of boaters being pulled by the strong tide or pushed by the wind which will lead to collisions and other hazardous situations.  With the bridge closed, emergency boats will not be able to render assistance to those in need.  With the push of boats going mainly downriver in the morning and upriver in the evenings, it will be very dangerous for boats wishing to go in the opposite direction considering the narrow passageway.

I recommend either 30 minutes open, 30 minutes closed or 15 min. open/ 15 closed around the clock or especially during daylight hours.  The Dixie Hwy. bridge will have to coordinate with this schedule or go back to an ""on demand"" schedule like they had before the Roosevelt Bridge repair work was done.

There were several lawsuits initiated. Brightline negotiated and agreed to make changes. While we are still very concerned, we agreed to drop the lawsuits and accept the high speed railroad with the agreed changes. Specifically, Brightline agreed to upgrade the existing railroad bridge and not change the opening of every 15 minutes. Now, Brightline is proposing to leave the existing bridge, not raise the clearance height, and keep the bridge down 45 minutes per hour. That will decimate our area including tourism, restaurants, gas stations, boating industry, property values, etc. We live here to be able to use our boats. Our property values are based in part on our access to the inlets and ocean. By not increasing the clearance for the bridge, smaller boats in addition to the larger will need the draw bridge to be opened for passage.  The volume of boaters in our area cannot possibly flow under the bridge in 15 minutes per hour.  We need access every minutes. Please bear in mind that the bridge is narrow.  If we have a long line going out and coming in at the same time, I believe only one way can access per time.  I have serious concerns of accidents if people are unwilling to wait a full hour if they ""miss"" the very limited proposed window. They may rush under the bridge while it is closing or cause an accident with another vessel trying to sneak in. We should be prioritized as users of the water way.  The train should not have priority over users of the water. If you cannot grant us access every quarter hour, we should at least have the same access as the train.  15 minutes up, 15 minutes down, 15 minutes up, 15 minutes down each hour.",,,,,,,

All this for what, an ill-designed plan, supported only by political interests who think that more railroad usage is good. Please look around because similar efforts in other states have failed.

Unless you have captained a vessel through these type bridges you cannot possibly understand the dangers. The unseen strong current, and the passageway is particularly narrow, especially for bigger boats, and most especially at the extremely narrow part at the railroad bridge. While we are and many of the CRUISERS NET users are strongly against this proposal, even under current conditions, which are already dangerous to people and property, the road bridge operator should immediately be given the authority to direct that boats move in batches, either W or E. ""I am now opening the bridge; the first group of boats which will be permitted to pass through are ONLY the Eastbound boats. Only when all EB boats have completed their passage, will I authorize ONLY the WB group of boat to proceed."" ALSO, the local police, the Sherrif's office, FWC and the USCG should have full enforcement authority for boats which violate the rule. This change would immediately eliminate the highly dangerous situation where two boats meet head-on in the narrow passages. Since some small boats do not monitor VHF radio, you should also erect electronic signs at both sides, indicating WB or EB traffic directions.",,,,,,,

As an operator of vessels less than 100 tons for the last 40 years, I find the possible long closures of the railroad bridge to be creating a dangerous and more likely life threatening situation. I’m sure those who are wanting the bridge closed for the duration being discussed don’t fully understand the power of water when a vessel is trapped against a bridge. I’ve watched videos of full size River tugs get sucked under due the the force of the water pushing it under. I feel that if the bridge is to be opened for only 15 min per hour, a situation will be created that will end up corralling a large number of vessels in a small congested area, sometimes with high swirling currents. Then throw in wind, storms and holidays and you will have more opportunity for someone to get hurt. There is no reason the bridge could not operate like the railroad bridges on the New River in Broward County. 

Should you proceed with the limited openings, I fear a venue will then be created for the next YouTube or Instagram viewing point, for the world to watch those with little experience or mechanical issues get caught buy the current and pulled under the bridge. 

Thank you for the opportunity to voice my concerns about what is being proposed.

I am opposed to the Coast Guard’s decision to make changes to the operation of the St Lucie River railroad bridge opening schedule. I feel like the citizens of Stuart continue to be trampled on by the Brightline Railway and its invasive nature to the quality of our lives. Not only will we soon be forced to endure more rattling railway noise and daily traffic snarls due to increased train traffic, but now our boaters, both commercial and recreational, will be expected to alter their schedules so as to once again accommodate the needs of Brightline Railway. To adjust the operating schedule so that boaters will have a mere15 minutes per hour to go under the bridge may create a sense of scheduled predictability, and it may look good on paper, but logistically that plan doesn’t make sense.  The proposed change is likely to create an unsafe situation for boaters as they wait and pile up for their limited opportunity to pass under the railroad bridge. What happens when all the boats don’t make it through during that 15-minute period?  Are the remaining boaters then required to wait another 45 minutes until the next bridge opening? Doesn’t seem like the boaters are getting a fair deal.  The boaters depend on available access to that waterway, and quite frankly, the boaters have been here long before Brightline was even a speck of a thought. The Coast Guard’s decision to bow down to the needs of Brightline is unfair; the boaters deserve a much more equitable schedule.

I stand to lose or gain little from this, but when I do go through there (and I have transited the Okeechobee Waterway and St. Lucie River twice in the last three years), I can comment on the ease with which I was able to get bridge openings and proceed. I do recall needing to get through Britt Point Railway Bridge on a particularly windy day on one of those passages, and being blow sideways while waiting for the Old Roosevelt Bridge to open. I can foresee dangerous outcomes if boat traffic backs up under those conditions, especially when the wind is gusting. I can also see, as others have no doubt pointed out, how the ability for emergency craft to get through to respond to emergency situations is a very big concern. To be fair, I am a huge proponent of passenger rail service. I want to see that happen, but it may well mean investment in rail infrastructure is warranted to make it work efficiently and safely. Let's not put the cart before the horse—let's not run the train before we have built the trestle. It doesn't need to be a 60' clearance to be a safe situation. 20' of clearance would get emergency craft through without an opening, and probably allow 70% of the marine traffic that requires an opening at the current bridge clearance to transit without. The rail operators should get together and fund a buildup of the rail bed in that area and a replacement bridge that allows for reasonable clearance of powerboat traffic to prevent, as much as is practicable, vessel traffic congestion at these rail bridges.",,,,,,,

Mast expressed his concern that boaters' access will be severely impaired by increased rail traffic and called on the U.S. Coast Guard to ensure that the bridge is closed for no more than 30 minutes combined for any 120-minute period. “This potential change in the bridge’s operations prioritizes rail traffic over boat traffic, and that’s not right. Moreover, it could jeopardize emergency operations and inhibit first responders. The Coast Guard must protect the right of way for boaters,” Mast wrote.
Additionally, it would be wise to require 24/7/365 around-the-clock onsite attendant/bridge tender to control the operation of the bridge, an onsite attendant/bridge tender at each bridge who would respond to radio contacts from vessels via VHF Channels 09 AND 16 relative to bridge openings and closings.  The attendant/bridge tender should be required to keep the bridge open to marine traffic when trains are not crossing.

I am Ted Condit and I live in Palm City Fl. I am a boat Captain and utilize the Okeechobee waterway daily. Closing the rail bridge in Stuart for any period of time will have serious side effects to the community as a whole. I understand that the Brightline is very important to some people, and it may even help our community in some small way, however it will definitely adversely effect the community in a huge way. The three bridges, as I like to refer to them, the rail, draw and causeway bridge, that are all next to each other crossing over the Okeechobee waterway in Stuart are already a problem as they exist now, in particular the rail bridge. The amount of boat traffic that maneuvers through that space is significant, and every time the bridge is down there develops a large gathering of vessels waiting to get through. This is a problem already because people are jockeying to get to the head of the line and get through first. Closing the bridge for 45 minutes out of 60 will have an even worse effect on this problem. I fear that there will be a lot of boat accidents, which will require a lot of the Coast Guards time. Aside from issues with boating accidents, there is the concern of people who make their living on the water, this could adversely affect them to the point of having to close their businesses. I, for one, wouldn’t be able to maintain my business, which requires me to go through that area every day, there’s no way I could guarantee arrivals and departures, I might have to wait a few hours to get past the bridges. There are additional concerns of weather, people running to get away from a storm, the bridge being down most of the time would mean no one can get away from a storm, stranding them in the water while lighting strikes all around. Last but not least, waterborne emergency services will be cut off from responding to any situations that arise on the opposite side of the bridge, including the Coast Guard. In summary, allowing the Stuart rail bridge over the Okeechobee waterway to be closed 3/4 of every hour will risk peoples lives, put people out of business, trap them in bad weather and prevent them from getting help by emergency responders. I am struggling to understand why this is being entertained by the Coast Guard on a federal waterway. ",,,,,,,

This could lead to more accidents and emergencies.  Has anyone collected traffic data at various periods to support the 15 minute proposal?  My supporting evidence is simply walking under the Federal Hwy Bridge and seeing the boat traffic.   This will be a dangerous situation as boats queue up, not wanting to be too far from the bridge.   There simpy is not enough room.
2. There are restaurants, marinas, and personal property that will be economically impacted.  People will simply choose not to go through the hassle and give their business elsewhere (east side of the bridge).  Property values in Palm city will most likely be impacted.  Comment sense will tell you that people will simply avoid this area if it becomes painful to navigate.

3. What would the plan be if emergency boats were required to support the marina (fire) or an individual accident.  How would these boats pass the bridge if closed?

I am a new resident of Palm City and have purchased a home with a slip and intend to utilize the incredible St. Lucie River and Atlantic Ocean for boating and fishing.  I fully expect to pass through the bridge between 2-3 times per week.

Potential alternate solutions could be 1) a longer opening time - say 30 min; 2) A variable opening time based on both public traffic and train schedules - say open from time A to B, 30 min openings from time C to D, and shorter times only during the busiest train schedule.  Weekends would need longer openings.  The development of this solution has to be data driven - understanding the traffic patterns under the bridge with a broad spectrum of time periods.  3) A new bridge.",,,,,,,

I could see something very tragic happening with this bridge if they do not adjust this planning and allow at least a 30min consistently every hour.

As it is now, I am delayed by the Railroad Bridge about 1 out of every 3 transits and there are always other boats waiting. Sometimes it is only for a few minutes, but I have waited as long as 45 minutes and the vessel traffic builds quickly the entire time, day or night.

There are two very dangerous scenarios that I have witnessed firsthand with extended bridge closures. First, thunderstorms can build and move quickly in Florida. During the longest bridge closure I experienced I was caught in a heavy thunderstorm with strong winds and lightning. The traffic congestion was hazardous as boats maneuvered to try to find places under the the high bridge to the north to avoid rain and lightning. Keeping the railroad bridge closed for extended periods as proposed will lead to some type of maritime accident, especially during times of hazardous weather.

The other dangerous situation, one that I personally experienced Sunday, July 17, involved police marine unit response. There was a woman in danger of falling off the Palm City bridge by Leighton Park. I was preparing to depart for a morning fishing trip from the park when two police officers rushed to my boat and asked if I could take them to the site of the woman on the bridge. We arrived on site and waited for nearly an hour before the police marine unit showed up. They launch from Sandprit Park and must transit the Railroad Bridge to access the site. Allowing rail traffic to dictate bridge closures means emergency response times can and will be significantly delayed. 

I would propose that any and all rail traffic be expected to transit during a regulated and strictly scheduled 15-minute window every hour. Or, at the very most, two 10-minute windows. These openings shall be firm so rail and vessel traffic can expect to pass at regular times.

All other traffic closures in the area should be scheduled to comply with this schedule. The people living, working and navigating in Martin County should not have their lives excessively disrupted and their emergency response times delayed due to an outside interest that only passes through and offers no benefit whatsoever to the local community.",,,,,,,

Yes, It's the only way eastbound if west of the Okeechobee Waterway FEC Railroad Bridge in Stuart

(2) How often do you transit this waterway?
Everytime I use the boat, can be daily to weekly, depending on season and weather.
(3) If railway traffic impedes your navigation of this area, how long are you normally delayed?
Since I open the Roosevelt Bridge, I arrive according to bridge schedule.  When the railroad bridge is down, the wait is unpredictable, sometimes a few minutes, usually longer, occasionally 1/2 hour or longer. 
(4) How would you propose to regulate the balance of railway and maritime traffic in this area?
It only makes sense for the railroad bridge to be on the same schedule as the Roosevelt bridge.


(5) What challenges have you experienced when transiting this area due to these bridges and/or railway activity?
For me, inbound wait is worse than outbound wait, Current, shallow areas, congestion between the RR bridge and US1 bridge and exposure to a larger body of water during inclement weather are more difficult on this side.
(6) At what frequency and duration should the drawbridge openings occur in order to meet the needs of navigation?
The current regulations are are a fair balance for boaters and road traffic.

(7) Should the SR 707 (Dixie Hwy) Bridge opening schedule mirror the operating schedule of the FEC Railroad Bridge?
Nothing else would make sense.

I've been a boat owner for over 50 years now, with a 30 year period of them as a licensed captain.  As a property owner and boat owner on the North Fork of the St Lucie River, I am concerned about my future boating activities and negative property value impacts on my waterfront home.  I've worked hard these last 50 some years, not retiring until 72 years old, moving here from Fort Lauderdale seeking less restrictive access to our waterways.  Why is it some recent entry into the Florida land scape is allowed to have this kind of impact on residents who have invested their past and future in the State of Florida.

All roads built in the United States came after this law was passed, and so,  because the railroad came before roads, the trains have the right of way.

This law does not seem to contain any reference to marine traffic. But, based on the above law referencing that trains came before cars, we can perhaps leverage that with marine traffic.

Rivers and navigable intracoastal waterways existed before the tracks were laid down, and so, those rivers and waterways should have rights of way over all bridges crossing over them.  In the past, this seems to have been the case, as railroad crossings over waterways have remained open for the majority of time, closing only upon the crossing of the trains. 

The fact that the railroad has chosen to exercise more profits by adding more trains, either for passenger use, or further freight usage, should not alter this schedule. The waterways were there first, and should ultimately command a greater right of way over the railroad. Let the trains give way to the boat traffic by having the trains adjust their speed upon approaching the bridges to wait for their openings.

I am worried that the Coast Guard will prioritize Brightline over boaters, and that’s not right.  The water - and those who use it - have the right-of-way, not trains.

The Coast Guard says that its goal is to provide a “more predictable schedule” for boaters, but I’m worried that “more predictable” is code for “less access.”  For example, forcing boats to use tiny windows of 15 minutes each hour to go under the bridge, while Brightline trains roll through dozens of times per day, is predictable but it’s certainly not equitable.

In my opinion, at a minimum, boaters must have at least as much opportunity to pass as trains.  Anything less is unacceptable.

This public comment period is the only opportunity our community will have to influence a major decision that will impact our community for years to come: We are already feeling the terrible effect of this. Living in Port St Lucie we will lose access to the waterways while this building is happening. There are already no dock spaces available in this area and this is making it worse.

This creates a situation where many boats of all sizes congregate in a small area awaiting an opportunity to cross under.  The passageway is very narrow and especially when everyone is trying to go through from both sides.  Keeping this bridge down for any length of time is a hazard to vessels using the Inter Coastal Waterway.  There should be an alternative route or perhaps Brightline can pay for a renovation of this bridge to allow a higher crossing area so as not to interfere with current water traffic.  These waterways are already busy without adding another layer of hazards.

I believe predictability is of utmost importance to us, so I would suggest that you set specific times when the railroad bridge will be down, perhaps from the top of the hour to the bottom, and then leave the bridge open for the remainder of the hour. Boaters can then time their arrival at the channel, which is narrow and already presents a difficult passageway. ",,,,,,,

Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the Drawbridge Regulation for the FEC Railroad Bridge 7.4. Located on the St. Lucie River one mile from Bridge 7.4, Meridian Marina is the only marina in Palm City, FL. We are the largest marina in Martin County on 11.75 acres with a 62,000 sq. ft. indoor storage facility that accommodates 300 boats, including the Martin County Sheriff’s Vessel. Due to the great demand for additional boat storage in our area, we will be undergoing a planned expansion to 540 boats in the near future. That will also include the opening of a waterfront restaurant to be frequented by boat and land traffic. 

The long-term solution for Bridge 7.4 requires a replacement of the outdated, single-track bridge to either a tunnel or a new bridge that raises the mean vertical elevation to at least the same height as the SR 707 Dixie Hwy Bridge 7.5, with openings and closings to be coordinated. Until that new bridge is in place, the regulation governing Bridge 7.4 must recognize the marine traffic right-of-way and continue to prioritize the needs and safety of the boating public by strictly limiting the number of trains permitted to pass.  

As part of the Okeechobee Waterway, a Federally maintained waterway with a regional financial impact in the hundreds of millions of dollars, the area of the railroad crossing at Bridge 7.4 is a vital artery for vessel traffic. Restrictions to marine traffic due to insufficient passage time at Bridge 7.4 would negatively impact the boating public and a multitude of marine-related businesses; lead to reduced property values for tens of thousands of homeowners; and develop a significant life safety issue for boating traffic at the bridge.  

The last four years have seen record boat sales, and likewise, marine businesses have invested significantly to serve the growing demand. The number and size of vessels navigating through Bridge 7.4 have increased exponentially every year, and additional traffic studies must be done, as per the 2019 settlement agreement between Martin County and Brightline, before permitting increased rail traffic. Further, once new regulations are proposed, we request there be an additional public comment opportunity for stakeholders to once again provide comments before finalization.

Meridian provides dockage to the Martin County Sheriff’s Vessel, which patrols the large area along the St. Lucie River/Inlet and responds to emergency calls on both sides of Bridge 7.4 daily. When there is an emergency on the water, the Sheriff’s vessel is often first on the scene, and a blockage at either side of the bridge could easily lead to loss of life and inability to protect public safety.

Given our proximity to Bridge 7.4, we have firsthand experience with the dangerous conditions that arise when boats are queued up at the bridge, attempting to hold their positions in a congested space with ripping current. We have witnessed at least one accident and a half dozen near-misses in the last year. To appropriately balance the needs and safety of the marine and rail traffic, the Bridge 7.4 operating schedule must incorporate three key elements: predictability (a published schedule); high frequency of openings (multiple per hour); and sufficient duration of openings (at least 15 minutes per opening to allow all traffic to safely pass). The operating regulation should, at a minimum, provide for:

a)	Bridge should remain in open position at all times except for passage of rail traffic, inspections, and maintenance where closure is required. Acceptable time limits should be set for these activities and strictly enforced.
b)	Bridge should not be down for more than 15 consecutive minutes from 6 AM to 9:59 PM. Bridge shall not be down for more than 30 consecutive minutes outside of these hours.
c)	A published schedule must provide fixed times when the bridge must be open and extend these times during high traffic periods to include weekends and federal holidays.
d)	The schedule should include coordination of fixed opening periods with the SR 707 Dixie Hwy Bridge 7.5.
e)	Notwithstanding (a), the bridge shall be open to marine navigation for at least two (2) fixed 15-minute periods per hour from 6 AM to 9:59 PM.
f)	On weekends and federal holidays, the bridge shall be open for at least three (3) fixed 15-minute periods per hour from 6 AM to 9:59 PM.  
g)	A bridge tender must be onsite 24x7 to address communications and emergencies, including allowing special openings for Police and Fire craft.
h)	Provide advance notice for scheduled maintenance closures and public alerts for emergency issues with notice to the USCG as to the nature and time for resolution.
i)	Establish a monitoring program that reports any deviation from the regulation and enforcement that includes penalties for violations, including cameras, logging of bridge closure periods, and regularly scheduled public reviews of this information.",,,,,,"https://downloads.regulations.gov/USCG-2022-0222-1983/attachment_1.pdf",

Date: 7/18/22

To: United State Coast Guard 

Re: The Coast Guard is seeking information and comments on proposing a change to the drawbridge operating regulations for the Florida East Coast (FEC) Railroad Bridge, mile 7.4, and the SR 707 (Dixie Hwy) Bridge, mile 7.5, across the Okeechobee Waterway (OWW), at Stuart, Florida.

 I would first like to thank USCG for the opportunity to comment on the change to the drawbridge operating regulations for the Florida East Coast (FEC) Railroad Bridge, mile 7.4. 
As the Owner and operator of Indiantown Marina located inland on the Okeechobee Waterway, I believe I can attest to the importance of unimpeded navigation in Martin County Florida. As an avid boater myself, I have sat at the Railroad Bridge in Stuart and observed the difficulties that now exist and can only imagine what will occur as railroad openings increase.  As I am sure you can also appreciate it will affect all commercial facilities such as Indiantown Marina and all waterfront residential properties west of the bridge as well. Indiantown Marina is a large working boat year and we dry store between 450 to 500 vessels which are constantly navigating to or from our facility, all encountering the Railroad bridge in Stuart.
As I am sure you are also aware, there are seven major commercial marinas and boat yards west the Railroad Bridge in Martin County and countless other small commercial and residential marine facilities as well. We are talking thousands of Martin County vessels and thousands more that use the Okeechobee Waterway to Cross the state, that encounter the Railroad bridge in question. Not to mention the Okeechobee Waterway is a State Intermodal System Evacuation Route which already has major issues and the railroad bridge is getting ready to add one more, all on the USCG watch.
Rather than beat you over the head with any more data and facts that you probably already know I will focus on what I believe is the obvious discussion points at this juncture.
One, we need a new railroad bridge with additional closed clearance.
Two, we need “equitable” usage at the absolute minimum for the reasonable needs of navigation. 
According the Supplemental Notification of Inquiry : For drawbridge operating regulations, the Coast Guard interprets “equitable” usage as access to the waterway which meets the reasonable needs of navigation while balancing the needs of competing modes of transportation.

So what does “equitable” mean: Websters Dictionary defines it as:
1: having or exhibiting equity: dealing fairly and equally with all concerned
an equitable settlement of the dispute
2: existing or valid in equity as distinguished from law
an equitable defense

I believe Websters definition is pretty clear: “dealing fairly and equally with all concerned”
I believe the Coast Guard in this instance, should at a minimum make sure that all things are equal. In this case that would translate to equal time of bridge being open and or closed at all hours of the day.  I believe this was the regulation outcome of the New River drawbridge in Fort Lauderdale. Where the agreement I believe, states Trains cannot close the bridge for more than 60 minutes during any 120-minute period, and a new full-time tender has been assigned to the bridge as a facilitator to keep traffic moving over and under it. We would ask for the same protection, Equal Protection at minimum. 
So, there you have it, the problem somewhat mitigated until the whole Brightline/Virgin Trans USA    debacle blows up, in mass disruption of everyone’s lives on the east coast of Florida.  I would strongly encourage the USCG do their very best to protect navigation and hopefully avoid and absolute disaster for marine Industries in Martin County and the thousands of boating citizens and waterfront landowners that are going to be affected.

I thank You for your time and consideration.

I find it difficult to understand why the rail bridge is left in the down position for very long periods of time. These closures can happen at anytime but 5:30 in the afternoon seems to be the most likely time for extended holds. I’ve been stuck in thunderstorms 1/5 mile from home for over an hour, waiting for an opening. It’s dangerous when multiple boats await an opening, as the currents can rip through. Please take action to only have the bridge down when trains are approaching and not waiting for another train to arrive from another county.

The drawbridge operation in Stuart is vital for marine traffic and safety. Having the bridge closed for 45 mins out of an hour is not an option.  this will be dangerous to the vessels waiting at the bridge, dangerous for safety operations to get to the other side of the bridge.  The USCG will not be able to transit the bridge for drowning victims or boat accidents.   This cuts off a vital pipeline for commercial ships west coast to east coast of Florida.  

Norfolk VA has a lot of trains and a lot of boat traffic, bridges are never left down for that long.  they are on a posted schedule allowing traffic to plan on reasonalbe openings.  15 minutes for 100 plus boats will be unacceptable on busy days.  

If you have every watched a sailboat transit a bridge, you would understand that it can take 5 minutes for a single boat to get though the bridge opening. 

 I recommend that the USCG spend some time researching this before just bending over to the needs of brightline.  

I am absolutely not in favor of the proposed closings.  it needs to be open for 30 mins per hour.  Weather it is 2 15 min openings or closed for 30 mins, this needs to be extended.",,,,,,,

The wait times and navigation safety issues are well spelled out in many comments. I think a larger issue is taxpayer money used to fund this additional train line, which makes me a stakeholder and increases the weight of my opinion. This issue can be viewed through the comparable lens of  plane landings at airports in residential areas during evening hours. As these engines cause vibration damage to housing fixtures such as windows and door jams, the noise of larger engines directly affects peoples daily lives, specifically sleep habits. To remedy this, landings and takeoffs are restricted during blocks of hours in the evenings. If my tax dollars have been used to construct this, then I have a right to not be adversely impacted by the schedule. Your 15 min/hour opening presupposes that this is the only window available to allow boaters to access the waterway under the bridge. This is someone else’s idea, and it does not align with the needs of taxpayers and boaters. The only equitable solution to this is the same one that the FAA must follow: large restricted time blocks of usage by the Brightline. We paid for it, so we get the lion’s share of the say so on what happens. Restrict Brightline transit for a two to three hour block before and after sunrise. Restrict Brightline traffic for a one to two hour block during the early afternoon. Restrict Brightline traffic for a two hour block from 5pm to 7pm. With these blocks in place, then we will accept your 15 min blocks per hour. You took our money to pay for this, it will affect business both economically and structurally, and it impedes on our lifestyle and the freedom to traverse the waterway. These are the only amicable solutions to the proposal ",,,,,,,

If they think 75 vessels can safely navigate through the passage way they are obviously out of touch with reality.  Any time the old Roosevelt bridge opens to let larger vessels through you are looking at at least over 5 minutes for said bridge to open, waiting for the bridge to fully open prior to entering the bridge space and then the bridge closing.  During incoming and outgoing tides at peak time the current moves through the bridge area at a substantial speed and to safely navigate through those areas you need to be on high alert.  Adding the additional congestion to the water way I feel would increase risks of damage and injuries.  
I feel that if this whole brightline deal goes through it is just another thing that the tax payer has to deal with.  The company can say all they want about how it is ""privately"" funded,  but in all reality down the road it is going to burden the Martin county residences who seem overwhelmingly not in favor of this Rail way.",,,,,,,

Lucie river and have passed through the Roosevelt bridge countless times. Most, if not all of the boats I have owned are not able to clear under the railroad drawbridge including the 22’ century I currently own. I am out on the water every weekend and usually encounter having to wait for the drawbridges to open. In my opinion a 15 minute window for boats to pass from east to west, vice Versa is not nearly enough time for the amount of boats to pass through that will be waiting on this drawbridge. It sound very dangerous to assume that 75 boats will be able to pass through in 15 minutes, and with the currents in that area of the river could potentially be deadly to boaters trying to navigate through the bridges. I have seen first hand maybe 5-8 boats try and pass through the drawbridges with the current allotted time and seen some very close encounters that could have caused very bad accidents. I would truly reconsider not opening the bridge for only 15 minutes to allow boats to pass through and ensure the saftey of the people who navigate these waters. ",,,,,,,

As an active boater a significant factor in my decision to purchase a home in the community that I chose was because it was located on the river and provided access to boating on the St Lucie River, the Intercoastal Waterway and the Atlantic Ocean via the St Lucie Inlet. The opening schedule of the FEC Railroad bridge in Stuart has a dramatic impact on boating and boating safety in this area.
The proposed increase in Brightline train traffic necessitating more frequent FEC railroad bridge closures will have a dramatically negative effect on boaters as well as marine oriented businesses and the general population in the Stuart, Jensen Beach and Palm City communities as well as the surrounding Martin County area. A list of negatives associated with increased train traffic passing through this area includes:
-Increases noise pollution 
-Significant road traffic congestion and delays
-Serious safety concerns for drivers and pedestrians 
-Impedance of emergency service responses both on land and on the water
-Impedance of hospital access
-Serious boating safety concerns due to congestion in a narrow passage that experiences strong currents
The irony is that Brightline, while negatively affects the residents of Stuart, Jensen Beach and Palm City in so many ways, yet it provides these communities no offsetting benefit. The Brightline train service does not even stop to take on or discharge passengers in any of these communities!
As a boater in the area for the past 9 (nine) years I am very familiar with the challenges of using the waterway in the FEC railroad and the Old Dixie Highway Bridge areas. The horizontal width between the concrete abutments of the FEC railroad bridge is very narrow. It is very common that only one boat at a time can pass through this opening due to its width which slows the opportunity for other boats to pass through. Simultaneously, because the width of the river is constricted by the concrete bridge abutments, the current through this area actually increases. Because this is also a slow zone, the maneuverability of boats decreases at lower speeds, while the current pushes the boats in ever changing directions increasing the potential for accidents. Add to this the reflected wave action resulting from the wakes of boats that have already passed through creating turbulence and the likelihood for accidents further increases. With more frequent bridge closings more boats will be anxious to pass through to avoid lengthy waiting times which suggests many will be going faster, creating larger wakes and will be in closer proximity to other boats again increasing the possibility of mishaps. Imagine the potential for negative or fatal results if a boating accident occurred, the bridge then closed and emergency safety responders could not get to the accident scene?
I have personally experienced long wait time at the FEC railroad bridge up to 20 minutes as the train schedules currently exist. I have also seen all boats but particularly larger boats accelerate to pass between the bridge abutments while the bridge is open to avoid having to wait. This situation will only get worse and more dangerous with the increased number of bridge closings if the Brightline request is granted as submitted.
Although, in my opinion, approval of the high speed Brightline train service was a dangerous error that endangers lives, diminishes the quality of life for many and provides little or no benefit to the communities that it will pass through I don’t expect the decision to be reversed. So, if we must accept that Brightline will pass through our communities necessitating more frequent FEC railroad bridge closures then the closures must be scheduled to minimize disruption and safety threats to the greatest extent possible. Towards that end I would suggest:
1.	The FEC railroad bridge be opened for a minimum of 15 minutes every half hour at the top and at the bottom of every daylight hour.
2.	The opening schedule for the FEC railroad bridge be done at the same time as the opening schedule for the Old Dixie Highway bridge to minimize the impedance of boat traffic through this narrow area.

My family has been stuck waiting for the bridge to raise, numerous times.  We own a home in Palm City and cross under the train bridge to go to or pass downtown Stuart or back home.  We have been impacted by the bridge being down, with 30+ boaters piling up, waiting for the bridge to be raised.   
I called a number I found online for the Roosevelt train, through a blog with people frustrated with the bridge being down so much.  The tender couldn’t provide me any timeline for when it would be raised but told me when it first went up.  It took nearly 40m to raise this last trip.  On that trip, after finding myself calling the tender on every one of the last trips, I saved the number as a contact on my phone.
I have small children.  We are baking under the hot sun.  We are surrounded by boats that continue to pile up and are at the mercy of the currents, pushing closer and closer to each other, many with a single engine that makes maneuvering difficult.  And also some with inexperienced captains.  And when the bridge finally goes up, you have to hope that those on the other side of the bridge know that it’s your turn to pass, so not to brush into each other through the narrow passing point.
I wish I had a picture. Once you’re waiting by that bridge, you’re stuck.  Can’t go by it and very difficult to turn around and navigate around the boats.  Hope no one has an emergency and needs to get back to land by any means necessary.",,,,,,"https://downloads.regulations.gov/USCG-2022-0222-2015/attachment_1.png",

I am the President of DeFever Cruisers, Inc, a club for owners of DeFever vessels.  Florida is home port for more than 130. About 100 more are located on the Atlantic coast.  Some of them move their boats to Florida seasonally. Hundreds of other boats, in Stuart alone, will be trapped by the closure of this bridge to vessel for many hours at unpredictable times unless a strict schedule is adopted.
The present bridge has a clearance above water of about 7 feet.  This is too low except for very small boats without fixed tops.  It must be raised.
I have several suggestions:
1.	 Elevate the approaches to the bridge.  There is about one-half mile of track south of the bridge, and one-half mile north of the bridge where I believe the track could be gradually elevated at just a very gentle 1 percent grade to the bridge.  This alone could raise the level of the rails by about 26 feet.  At 2%, 52 feet.  This vertical profile should be evaluated as part of the application process. A fixed bridge with clearance as is required on the ICW would be the preferred solution.  (I am a retired, licensed civil engineer with roadway and rail experience.)
2.	If a draw bridge is required, it should be designed to minimize the depth of the structure below the rails in order to maximize vertical waterway clearance. This is the easy one.
3.	Assuming a drawbridge is needed, and it can provide a clearance of perhaps 30 feet, then it could normally be in the closed position.  All but sailboats could pass under the closed bridge. Openings could then be “on demand” at scheduled times.  Boaters are used to that.    If the train is late, it will just have to slow down or stop and wait its turn. Train traffic in both directions would have to operate on the schedule. 
Our members, myself included, have utilized this bridge and all bridges on the Okeechobee Waterway to cross the state without making the very long trip via the Florida Keys.  And the local boating traffic, people who take day trips, should be treated fairly too.  There are hundreds of vessels in marinas and mooring fields in the immediate vicinity, including emergency vessels.
Please consider these ideas and evaluate them.  When the new bridge is constructed, there won’t likely be an opportunity to improve the design for another 100 years.  The boaters will be stuck with it. 
Thank you for including these ideas in your evaluation.

Railway traffic would impede the navigation of the area causing major delays.  These delays could create an one-two hours of back up of marine vessels. The railroad is in the way of vessels traveling between the Okechobee waterway/lock and the St. Lucie River.  In order to meet the needs of navigation it would be most efficient if the railway was down only 10 mins of each hour at most at a specific time. For example from 1:50 pm - 2 pm.  The railway will not only effect navigation but also tourism as boating is a major industry of the Treasure Coast.  If the bridge is down the majority of an hour then what happens when there is a storm and boats are trying to get back to docks? A storm is not going to wait for the train to pass....This is a huge safety issue.",,,,,,,

I have lived and boated in the Martin County waterways for over 40 years and it is our main family pastime for my immediate family of 4, and my extended family who also lives in Stuart.  My parents and myself moved to our current neighborhood of North River Shores as this community is by/on the water and has a private community boat ramp.  The public boat ramps in Martin County are already busy and over-capacity to support the number of boaters that live in the area.  This was a main reason for us finding a home in a neighborhood with a private boat ramp.  Because of the location, we traverse under the Roosevelt bridge almost every weekend, and sometimes multiple times on a weekend.  The current train schedule can be impactful when we are stuck coming or going because of a train.  This can be as few as 7 or 8 minutes, but typically 15-20 minutes and sometimes longer.  We typically get stuck by the train about 20% of the time which isn't great, but is acceptable as the time period between trains allows the backed up boat traffic plenty of time to get through the area safely.  The current around the train bridge and Roosevelt bridge make navigation difficult when no other boats are present as it can easily turn your vessel sideways when not under way.  When you put oncoming traffic going through these bridges at the same time, it actually is a little dangerous.  I've seen way too many near misses and several actual accidents as evidenced by the damage on the train bridge.  Trains force the boat traffic to back up and many vessels pack themselves very close to the bridges and not leave a safe navigable space between each other.  When the train bridge goes back up, I've seen as many as 70 plus boats rush to get through the bridges.  I fear the limited openings for boat traffic would cause many more boats to back up, and thus more rushing and boat traffic through tight/narrow channels with dangerous currents with limited time to get through.  The repeated limited openings would only compact this issue leading to accidents and dangerous situations in an already difficult area to navigate.
The current FEC railway schedule is working and should be remain in effect to not hinder boat traffic further.  A higher frequency of trains with less time for boats to traverse the area will cause more dangerous conditions for boats, which in turn could lead to more accidents between boats, or between boats and the actual railway bridge.  I propose leaving the railroad bridge opening schedule as it is today to alleviate further boat congestion that additional railway closures would cause.
IF the railroad bridge is closed more frequently, it would have a detrimental effect to all boaters and homeowners west of the railroad bridge.  Thousands of boats use this waterway and makes the areas west of the bridge attractive to tens of thousands of homeowners and tax payers.  Reducing access to this waterway could cause home values to drop as this area would be much less attractive to live for anyone that uses our waterways for recreation.  I would not have purchased a home where I did if the railroad bridge was closed the majority of the time for boaters, I would have looked for another neighborhood east of the bridge.  While it is true I could trailer my boat to a public ramp east of the bridge, that is true for the thousands of other boaters that will now contemplate that.  This will only make the limited number of boat ramps and accessibility east of the bridge worse.  As mentioned, those ramps are already over-capacity and we will now be shifting even more boats and trailers to these over-capacity ramps.  Similarly the large marinas west of the bridge will be much less attractive and will  likely lose a lot of business because of this, reducing local jobs.  
The current needs of navigation are currently being met.  Any reduction to boat access would negatively impact this and should not be allowed.  The optimum solution is exactly what was proposed by and agreed to by Brightline, for them to pay for and construct a new train bridge with higher clearance to not negatively impact so many boaters.  Without that solution, the train bridge should stay on it's current FEC schedule.

Brightline had said they would build a new bridge to address this issue but now does not want to spend the time/money doing it?  They already have one of the worst safety records of any rail line in the US. Now they want to take away boaters, both those who use the waterways for pleasure boating and fishing as well as those who earn their living this way. While some are tourists many of us are residents and taxpayers and live here because of the waterways here in South Florida. 
This will also cause safety issues when one is out boating and a storm suddenly comes us. Do we just sit and wait for the bridge to open for 15 minutes each hour while this danger approaches? That could certainly cause the Coast Guard to have a lot of additional demand.After all, Brightline is reportedly the most deadly railway in the US. Why allow them to negatively impact the lifes of thousands of south Florida boaters? Why  not leave the bridge, if it is not replaced, in the up/open position at all time when a train is not crossing? 
I urge the Coast Guard to reconsider giving all of the advantages to Brightline and not their fellow citizens.",,,,,,,

I transient the bridge at about six times a months (three each way) for the many years I lived here in Martin County, I have hated the railroad because when it closed I would spend an additional 45 minutes getting to the Ocean or back home. The West Dixie Bridge has always been on demand and easily navigated.  
I do not consider this increase of railroad bridge closures to be not only a navigational problem as much as a SAFETY problem for the boaters and the Coast Guard. 
Last weekend I saw about forty boats waiting to navigate through the bridges after a train came by. I found the railroad bridge closes twenty minutes before the train and is not open for twenty minute after the train clears the bridge. That means the boats must maneuver safely around keeping clearance away from other boats. God help them when a commercial barge shows up to get through. It is always more dangerous when the tide and the wind are behind you so they should be allowed to go through first.
In seventy years of boating most of my close calls have been going through bridges from having a boat stop in the middle to a boat speeding through to bridges trying close while I am going through plus many others.
I would like to request the West Dixie Bridge go back to demand rather the timed. I would also request that the Railroad Bridge is not allowed to stay close for more fifteen minutes.
A few years ago the Coast Guard requested comments as I see did not go anywhere and that I hope these comments will help the people of Martin and St. Lucie County.  
If the railroad has to build a new bridge, why don’t they build a tunnel that would correct the problem and I being woken up every night by the noise as the train goes across the bridge.

I propose that the balance should be 50-50 50% rail and 50% maritime traffic in that area. The challenges I have experienced in the past dealing with this railroad is it is a very tight passage and I have seen many near accidents occurring with only 10 boats trying to get through at a time but when you have boats coming from One Direction and the other direction especially larger vessels it’s so tight that it creates a very dangerous situation. I can’t even imagine trying to cross up to 70 boats at a time. Someone is going to get seriously hurt. As for the frequency and duration the drawbridge Ocean should occur I believe it should be spaced out to where boaters can time their crossings and be consistent so we don’t have long periods of time where you cannot get through.  Also it should be publicly scheduled and easy to access the schedule. Also I believe the state road 707 Dixie Highway bridge should mirror the operating schedule of the FEC railroad bridge since they are so close together.

Currently the FEC bridge remains in the open position the majority of the time, coming down only for infrequent freight trains.  This transit can be very crowded at certain times as there are so many recreational boaters, as well as commercial traffic coming through the Okeechobee waterway. Boaters are used to timing their trips based on a RR schedule, but to reasonably balance RR and boater's needs, boaters need at least 15 minutes twice an hour, say at the top of the hour, and on the half hour, to provide adequate time for safe passage.  Most boats cannot pass alongside each other  going in opposite directions. With wind and tidal action, this is dangerous and unreasonable.  In fact, with a 32' fishing boat, I have never crossed simultaneously with another boat coming in the opposite direction.  The Dixie Highway currently opens on demand, but it would be acceptable for it to mirror the suggested schedule of 15 minutes twice an hour.  If we can't get through this area without waiting more than 30 minutes the value of all boating facilities west of the FEC bridge will be adversely impacted.  The boats were here long before Brightline was permitted to run across this ancient bridge. Please don't forget the importance of the Okeechobee Waterway and the huge impact on commercial facilities and recreational boaters west of the bridge if traditional access is taken away.

There is no way boaters will be able to pass through safely if given only 15 minutes. You have boats coming from both directions that will be bottlenecked. Boaters will be forced to try to fight changing currents, water chop, detrimental weather and serious boat traffic to maintain a position to try to pass through the narrow channel. And this will be coming from both directions, allowing two small boats to pass at the maximum at the same time. This will be an extreme safety concern. This timing should reflect the most need to allow safe passage. There are too many changing conditions that boaters will face to force them to stay in the elements while waiting up to 45 minutes for the train bridge. Furthermore, most drawbridges that follow this time are ones that allow small boat travel at the very least due to a more elevated position. This train bridge will allow no access! Even the smallest boats will be forced to wait. This will alienate western areas like palm city and Port Saint Lucie from accessing the river, downtown Stuart, intercostal waterway, and other surrounding areas. It will cut off access to necessary resources as well as hinder emergency responders to safely and efficiently access both sides of the river in a timely manner. This will have major impacts on boater and resident safety! The timing needs a serous adjustment in favoring waterway access! It is a necessary and vital aspect of the community!",,,,,,,

I own multiple boats which I have used to transit the waterway beneath the Roosevelt and railroad bridges.  My boats have T-tops which do not fit beneath the railroad bridge when it is down, like many boats.  With occasional freight trains, I have had to wait for the railroad bridge to go up, sometimes for over an hour if three or more trains go by while it is down.  It is annoying, but does not happen each boating trip.  The proposed revised schedule for raising the railroad bridge for only brief periods each hour to accommodate high speed rail trains, while not even accounting for additional freight trains, is unacceptable to me as a member of the local boating community.  I almost exclusively fish offshore or go to the intracoastal waterway nearly every trip.  I also spend a significant amount of money supporting the local angling and boating industries.

If I knew that each trip I would be delayed for a significant amount of time both leaving and returning, I would be much less likely to go as often as I do.  This means I will spend a lot less supporting local marine industries.  If you were to take a look at the satellite view of all of the local waterways west of the Roosevelt Bridge and see all of the boats in marinas and docks of residents, I'm confident that you would be looking at thousands of anglers and enthusiasts just like me.  For many, boating would no longer be an enjoyable pastime knowing that they would be stuck waiting for the railroad bridge to go up.  This will cause a cascading effect, making it less desirable to own waterfront property west of the bridge and eventually significantly lowering property values as thousands of families move away from boating regularly.

This scenario is entirely preventable.  The railroad bridge must be raised more than it is down.  Upgrade the opening mechanism to be more responsive to passing trains so it doesn't have to be left down waiting for the next train to pass.  That or reduce the total expected number of trains.  A train that passes in two minutes should not make a boater wait for half an hour.",,,,,,,

(1) Do you currently transit through the FEC Railroad Bridge crossing the Okeechobee Waterway, mile 7.4, at Stuart, Florida? YES we do.
(2) How often do you transit this waterway? Everyday(3) If railway traffic impedes your navigation of this area, how long are you normally delayed? This varies from 30 min to an hour. 
(4) How would you propose to regulate the balance of railway and maritime traffic in this area? I am not sure how to make suggestions without knowing all aspects but if both bridges opened together I do think that would help. At least 2 openings per hour.
(5) What challenges have you experienced when transiting this area due to these bridges and/or railway activity? The railway bridge stays down for not just one train but then it stays down until the next passing train. I operate Stuart Sailing charters with a 40 ft catamaran so sitting in the area waiting for ability to get through is difficult and not safe with other vessels doing the same. This gets tricky for us because we may have a charter on board and are stuck on one side or another.
 (6) At what frequency and duration should the drawbridge openings occur in order to meet the needs of navigation? I am not sure exactly what to suggest as it is difficult for me to know all the factors. If there were at least 2-3 openings per hour that would allow for the flow of maritime traffic. 
(7) Should the SR 707 (Dixie Hwy) Bridge opening schedule mirror the operating schedule of the FEC Railroad Bridge?This would be very helpful as then tall boats would be able to get through. There are many times that the SR 707 bridge is scheduled to open and I am there to pass under but then the railway bridge closes so I can not go through and the SR 707 bridge doesn't open on schedule. ",,,,,,,

We cross the lake many times per year for boat shows, new boat offloads for Marlow Yachts and other brands we sell along with client deliveries and orientation. We often take the inside passage, especially when there is inclement weather and therefore go past the FEC Railroad Bridge often and year-round. Our minimum air draft is 19' with many of the Marlow Yachts we run being 25'+, depending on configuration. We can't afford to have severe delays at the FEC Railroad Bridge as it will be a hazard to navigation with boats stacking up waiting to get through and impede our business by restricting navigation. At a minimum the two bridges should be opened together every half hour or on demand as I see it. I would prefer on demand 24/7 if the train bridge needs to be closed for increased rail traffic but I see scheduled openings as the commonplace practice of compromise. Scheduled openings allow for everyone to plan ahead and accomplish what they need. The space between the two bridges is a tight space for larger yachts and if there is a lot of boat traffic on the weekend there is a potential buildup of boats waiting between them with smaller boats zooming about, sometimes causing unsafe conditions for those requiring deeper draft. I would suggest a staging area outside of the two bridges where larger boats wait to pass when the openings occur. This should increase safety and allow everyone to plan ahead and work together to get where they need to go.",,,,,,,

As it stands now, traffic (especially for bigger boats of the 30’+ Range) is typically single file. Most boaters comply with this unwritten rule due to short wait times to “get through” the bridge. Narrowing this time to 15 minutes will cause mass chaos as boaters will be attempting to pass from both directions during this short window. My personal opinion is that this will increase boating accidents, and with an increase in accidents increase boating fatalities.

I am a frequent boater in the St. Lucie River area and also the owner of Meridian Marina, the largest marina in Palm City, FL. Located just one mile west of the railroad bridge, Meridian Marina is home to a 62,000 sq. ft. indoor storage facility which houses 300 boats, including the Martin County Sheriff's Vessel. The volume of boaters has grown exponentially in our area over the last 5 years. Due to the great demand for additional boat storage, our marina is undergoing an expansion to 540 boats, which will also include the opening of a waterfront restaurant with a courtesy dock for patrons coming by boat. 

The appropriate, safe solution before increasing the volume of rail traffic should be a tunnel (preferably) or a replacement bridge that raises the elevation to minimally the same height as the SR 707 Dixie Hwy Bridge, with openings and closings to be coordinated. Until such a new tunnel or bridge is in place, the regulation governing the railroad bridge should recognize the marine traffic right-of-way and prioritize the safety of the boating public.

The waterway at the current bridge site is a narrow, single-file passageway in a congested area prone to high winds and strong currents. On a typical weekend, holiday, or busier afternoon, 70 to 100 or more boats an hour may traverse the bridge coming from both directions. Those of us who have witnessed firsthand the congestion that can occur at the bridge can testify that the orderly passage of 70+ boats of varying sizes through that single-file chokepoint would be impossible to accomplish in a 15-minute-per-hour opening. Not merely impossible, but the hazardous boating conditions such a regulation would create would constitute reckless endangerment.

To that end, I respectfully request the USCG develop an operational regulation for the railroad bridge that:
1.	Opens the railroad bridge to marine traffic for at least 45 minutes out of each hour;
2.	Extends additional access to marine traffic on Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays;
3.	Limits the railroad bridge from being closed to marine traffic for more than 15 consecutive minutes from 6:00 AM to 10:00 PM;
4.	Coordinates openings with the SR 707 Dixie Hwy Bridge (but does not limit them to just when the much higher Dixie Hwy bridge is open);
5.	Requires a bridge tender onsite 24 x 7 to monitor safety and address emergencies, including enabling special openings for police, fire, and USCG vessels;
6.	Publishes a fixed schedule available to the public through multiple modalities;
7.	Requires advance notice for scheduled closures (with opportunity for public comment if these extend beyond 3 hours) and public alerts for emergency issues with notice to USCG and estimated resolution time; and 
8.	Implements a monitoring and enforcement program that reports deviations from the regulation, assesses penalties for violations, and makes this information available to the public.

I appreciate the opportunity to comment on this important matter and look forward to the USCG continuing to keep our waterways safe and accessible to thousands of boaters who regularly utilize this federal waterway.

Like nearly all boaters in the area, I am at the mercy of the train bridge.  

It is a relatively common occurrence to be stopped by the train bridge for periods ranging from 15 minutes to 45 minutes or more.  This occurs at all hours of the day from early morning departures to the Bahamas to returns from local fishing and sandbar trips.

The current train bridge is not allowed passage of any boat with even a simple top. This is not an issue of large boats or yachts but,  every day boats.  During non-busy times it’s a major inconvenience, during busy portions of the day it borders on dangerous. It presents a hazard to navigation. When the bridge goes up, it’s basically a free-for-all to navigate the narrow opening. Two average size boats crossing between the spans is a dicey situation, with any sort of large boat, it’s not even close to possible. The span is very narrow with a cross current and not easy to navigate with boat wakes and rebound off of the wooden sides. 

15 minutes per hour in no way represents a fair opportunity for boaters.  Under the proposed regulation, it could be as long as one hour and 45 minutes between openings. 15 minutes per hour will result in the buildup of an excessive amount of boats, and a significant navigational hazard as the boats struggle to clear the span in 15 minutes. Even a public schedule would not be helpful because it would still be the 15 minute allotment of time.

I am not against Brightline, but 15 minutes does not represent enough time from either a safety or fairness standpoint. I think the bare minimum boaters should have access for half the time, that being 30 minutes per hour and no more than 30 minutes between openings.

The vast  majority of boaters do not require an opening of the drawbridge at the same time as the train bridge, but absolutely the drawbridge needs to be open while the train bridge is open in order to allow fair access for the larger boats. Otherwise, they will build up and this will be a significant navigational hazard as they are included in the passage through the train bridge span.

Thank you for your consideration and please help preserve navigational safety

Two months ago the RR bridge was down and the boating traffic backed up East and West bound for 50 plus minutes.  I counted at least 43 plus boats waiting to pass.  Not all made it as the Roosevelt bridge tender had to close the bridge after a few minutes.

(2) How often do you transit this waterway? 

Everyday

(3) If railway traffic impedes your navigation of this area, how long are you normally delayed? 

This varies from 30 min to an hour. 

(4) How would you propose to regulate the balance of railway and maritime traffic in this area? 

I am not sure how to make suggestions without knowing all aspects but if both bridges opened together I do think that would help. At least 2 openings per hour.

(5) What challenges have you experienced when transiting this area due to these bridges and/or railway activity? 

The railway bridge stays down for not just one train but then it stays down until the next passing train. We operate Stuart Sailing Charters LLC with a 40 ft catamaran so sitting in the area waiting for ability to get through is difficult and not safe with other vessels doing the same. This gets tricky for us because we may have a charter on board and are stuck on one side or another. 

(6) At what frequency and duration should the drawbridge openings occur in order to meet the needs of navigation?

 I am not sure exactly what to suggest as it is difficult for me to know all the factors. If there were at least 2-3 openings per hour that would allow for the flow of maritime traffic. 

(7) Should the SR 707 (Dixie Hwy) Bridge opening schedule mirror the operating schedule of the FEC Railroad Bridge?

This would be very helpful as tall boats would be able to get through. There are many times that the SR 707 bridge is scheduled to open and I am there to pass under but then the railway bridge closes so I can not go through and the SR 707 bridge doesn't open on schedule. This makes the entire transit totally unpredictable and challenging. ",,,,,,,

Additionally, one should reasonably expect one freight train per hour crossing the bridge although many will cross during darkness when most recreational boating traffic is finished for the day.

Using current bridge regulations, with three trains crossing hourly, the bridge would be closed an estimated 11 minutes per train or 33 minutes per hour. This factors the 8 minutes the bridge is closed prior to the arrival of a train, plus three minutes to get a freight train across the bridge. The Jupiter and Stuart movable bridges open quickly after the passing of a train.
Short of seeing departure times of each train from West Palm or Orlando, and not knowing speed of the train, it is difficult to reasonably determine whether there will be three separate openings of the draw. Perhaps one closure can accommodate the passage of two trains?
If Brightline is operating  at just 90 mph vice advertised speeds of 110 mph, the train is covering 9 miles in 6 minutes. If the bridge fails to close and lock, existing regulations allow the dispatcher time to bring a train to a safe stop, hopefully in a location where grade crossings are not blocked. Something less than 8 minutes might not allow enough time.
 Reducing the time the bridge closes prior to arrival of a train and hoping positive train control can stop the train in an emergency is a dangerous precedent.

Existing regulations allow for the reasonable needs of the maritime community while allowing for the safe operation of passenger and freight traffic on the FEC.",,,,,,,

Summer thunderstorms pop up rapidly, and those boaters without cabins have no safe place to retreat to while waiting for the bridge to open, unnecessarily putting them in harm’s way.

On the weekends, the volume of traffic navigating the bridge is quite substantial at any given moment, and only allowing for 15 minutes of passage poses a safety hazard, as the majority of boaters are recreational and don’t have the extensive boating  knowledge a professional captain does.

The homes behind the bridge are typically of high value, with the property owners shouldering a substantial share of the tax burden.  These residents should be entitled to use the resources they pay for within a reasonable amount of time.

The normal delay when the bridge is closed is at least 15 minutes.
Any balance of marine and rail traffic has to take into account one basic fact: when trains stop they stay put; when vessels stop they drift. The longer the bridge is closed to marine traffic the more vessels will gather awaiting transit, drifting and jogging for position in restricted waterways with significant currents, increasing the chances for collisions and groundings. Therefore, in order to meet the needs of navigation, the bridge should never be closed to marine traffic for longer than 15 minutes, and remain open between closings for a minimum of 15 minutes.
The challenges posed by the bridge are a function of its location. The west side of the bridge has a large open area where vessels can await an opening, but an eastbound vessel, upon approaching the open bridge, has limited visibility of westbound traffic until such vessel is very close to the Dixie Hwy bridge, and only the smallest vessels can pass while transiting either bridge. This means an eastbound vessel, upon sighting westbound traffic under either bridge, must reverse course, a hazardous maneuver if a large number of other westbound vessels have gathered during the closed period and are close aboard. The east side of the bridges poses worst conditions. There is limited room between the RR bridge and the Roosevelt Bridge for vessels to wait; therefore most will be forced to stand by on the east side of the Roosevelt. The channel here is narrow, bordered by an extensive shoal area on the south side and subject to swift currents, making vessel groundings and collisions more likely as vessels gather here. Similar visibility problems exist on this side of the bridges also, adding to the danger to marine traffic extended bridge closings poses.
The Dixie Hwy bridge has enough clearance to allow many smaller vessels to transit without opening; therefore, unless a larger vessel requests an opening the Dixie bridge can remain closed while the RR bridge is open. No vessel larger than a canoe can transit the RR bridge when it is closed, therefore there is no reason to open the Dixie bridge when the RR bridge is closed.
Any balance of RR and marine interests has to consider this fact: The RR was made aware of the limitations to its operations the RR bridge presented when the rail service expansion was proposed. An alternate rail route to the west that did not involve crossing navigable waterways was rejected by the RR. The RR chose to proceed knowing the limitations its traffic faced in crossing the St. Lucie River. The RR should not now be allowed to substantially alter the long-standing ability of marine traffic to proceed through this bridge with minimal delay. If the RR is now complaining of operating delays caused by its trains having to wait for marine traffic to pass it must be remembered that this is a condition that they willingly accepted by proceeding with the construction of the rail expansion using the existing bridge.

6/Remain open until needed.  Coordinate with the Roosevelt Bridge opening.
7/Yes, but not to the determent of the marine traffic.  This is not only a fishing & recreational concern, but also a commercial & emergency services concern! Don't put us in harm's way by severely restricting this bridge!",,,,,,,

We are a membership organization with 5,500 active memberships totaling about 9,000 individuals.  Our members cruise the eastern part of the U.S. and frequently travel the area of the Okeechobee Waterway where the SR 707 (Dixie Hwy) Bridge and FEC Railroad Bridge are located.

The use of these bridges by trains should not supersede the ability of boaters to navigate the waterways in as unrestricted a nature as possible. In the area for which you requested comments, keeping a vessel that is impeded by a closed bridge under control in adverse weather conditions is a challenge, even for experienced boaters. It is even more difficult for inexperienced boaters.  Therefore, in addition to the rights of boaters to use the waterways, there is a serious safety concern with frequent or long bridge closures in this area. 

Given that the SR 707 (Dixie Highway Bridge) already opens on a schedule, it seems prudent to require that the FEC Railroad bridge also be open when the highway bridge is open. In essence, the two bridges should operate as one, as it does boaters no good to be able to pass through one and not the other. Trains should be scheduled appropriately to accommodate the existing SR 707 bridge openings.

In unavoidable circumstances where a train is off-schedule and requires the bridge to be closed when it should be open per the published schedule, it should open at the earliest opportunity. In this case, the highway bridge’s scheduled opening should also be delayed so that boats may freely pass both bridges when the opening occurs. 

Currently, the FEC Railroad bridge is not always tended and does not respond to VHF radio calls. To ensure coordination with boats and both bridges, the Railroad bridge should be tended at all times with operators monitoring VHF channels 09 and 16.

Finally, if FEC Railroad regularly has trains running across at times of scheduled openings, leading to the bridge being closed and boaters being unable to pass, then to help ensure safety, FEC RR should provide dockage on both sides of the bridges, of sufficient lengths and strength, to accommodate the anticipated number and types of vessels forced to wait for bridge openings.

Thank you for the opportunity to participate in this process.

Responses to questions:
1/Yes, I currently transit through the FEC Railroad Bridge crossing the Okeechobee Waterway, mile 7.4, at Stuart, FL, waterway opening often.
2/I personally transit this intersection three to four round trips per week.
3/Typical delays for me would be 20 minutes to 1/2 hour, but have been up to 2 hours. More to the point is the question of emergency services delays such as Coast Guard, Martin County Sheriffs and US Fish & Wildlife officers.
4/My preference would be to regulate the balance of marine traffic through this waterway by having the railroad bridge in an open position when not in use, and have both the railroad bridge and the SR 707 highway bridge open to marine traffic with regularly-scheduled openings of 10 to 15 minutes every half hour as a regularly-scheduled time, 24 hours/day.
5/Current challenges include: 1) Strong water currents; 2) very tight through-fare between three bridges; 3) heavy small-boat traffic cutting to front of line; 4) no designated waiting area out of the channel; and 5) poor communication anticipating the timing of the next railroad bridge opening.
6/BOTH the railway bridge and the SR 707 Bridge should be scheduled to open for ten to fifteen minutes every one-half hour; twenty-four hours/day.
7/This is not a 'yes' or 'no' question. BOTH should be open 10 to 15 minutes every 1/2 hour, 24 hours/day.

ADDITIONAL COMMENTS:
In addition to the bridge schedules, attention should be paid to the Okeechobee Waterway speed and wake zones leading from the Indian Street ""Veterans"" Bridge to these openings - boats are traveling too fast for safety and creating property damage trying to make the bridge openings.  ",,,,,,,

With a vertical clearance of only 6.5' at mean high water the overwhelming majority of local boats wishing to pass through the bridge will require it to be opened to safely traverse.  And with a width of only 50' boats can only pass single file with the bridge open.  In addition the waterway is subject to strong currents which mandate that safe distances be maintained between boats lined up and passing through.  And with a short distance between the railroad bridge and the A1A bridge (see attached photo)  there is insufficient room for boats to congregate in that area.

This waterway is part of the major waterway that connects the east and west coast boaters passing through Lake Okeechobee.  During most of the year and especially during the winter months there are significant number of boaters wishing to pass under the bridges.  Keeping the railroad bridge open for only 15 minutes every hour is insufficient for safe passage and if implemented will represent a significant navigation safety hazard likely resulting in boating accidents.",,,,,,"https://downloads.regulations.gov/USCG-2022-0222-2103/attachment_1.pdf",

Reducing the bridge open time for the railroad is going to be extremely detrimental and hazardous. As a boat owner that passes through that bridge multiple times and as a sailboat that doesn’t have the capacity to go as fast as other boats it will put us in danger. We do not have the ability to rev our engine to get through in a small window of time and be in competition with other boats who have bigger motors and go faster. I don’t believe everybody will follow the rules or will acknowledge that other people need to be through that bridge as well. It’s already a dangerous place to go through let alone compiling a number of boats all wanting to dart through. I could see something very tragic happening with this bridge if they do not adjust this planning and allow at least a 30min consistently every hour. 
Please consider how this affects the residents and boaters that go through this passage, including those who use it to access the Okeechobee waterway. This will be a sad tragic nightmare.",,,,,,,

Comments on the information requested are as follows:
Question 1 &2:  We live in Palm City west of the bridge and regularly, mostly on weekends, during daylight hours, transit through the bridge crossing, mile 7.4 at Stuart, Florida.   Many of our neighbors go out much more often than we do.  Boating and all water activities are a part of the community culture and bring a lot of business and money into the community.  
Question 3:  Currently the bridge is kept in the up position unless there is a train coming; if a train is coming the bridge is down. We have been delayed only a few times due to the railroad bridge being down as there is only 6-7 feet (ft) vertical clearance at high tide. We personally do not need the SR 707 (Dixie Hwy) bridge to be open for us to transit the area, only the railroad bridge.  One time the railroad bridge was down, and we were delayed about 30 minutes; however, usually the train passes by quickly.  Of larger concern is the congregation of boats in the area while waiting to go through which we believe creates a dangerous boating situation that would be exacerbated by longer closings.   
Question 5:  Some challenges we have encountered include:
•	A large number of boats (much less than 70 which we’ve heard the USCG thinks can transit the area in 15 minutes), some small, some large, some with more control (single engines, jet boats, barges, etc.) than others, congregating in the area; 
•	The narrowness of the bridge transit  -  the horizontal clearance is 50 ft - most 26 to 33 ft boats are 10 ft wide and if the boat is larger it must go through single file, one per direction;
•	The low vertical clearance of the railroad bridge when closed; 
•	The strong current under the bridge along with wind which can make navigation difficult;  
•	Shoals/shallow areas just outside the channel.  
Question 4 and 6:  At the very least, boaters should have equal access and we propose boaters get 45 minutes and the train gets 15 minutes. The current schedule of opening when a train is coming hasn’t been overly restrictive and we do not have an issue with it.  If more trains (“dozens” according to one news article) are planned for the track at a higher speed due to Brightline operation (is this the reason the schedule needs changing?), I submit that our community is getting negatively affected without any benefit and rail traffic is being given more priority than our community despite the lack of any positive contributions by the railroad.   In addition, the railroad bridge should be replaced - we’ve heard rumors about its age and disrepair.  A proper and modern railroad bridge should be constructed with vertical and horizontal clearance that would improve and provide freer access to a larger percentage of boats.  The number of trains should be limited until such a bridge is constructed. 
Question 7:  If the railroad bridge is only open for specific time period each hour, then the SR707 bridge should be open as well so larger boats can go through while the railroad bridge is open.  This will likely cause some traffic disruption in downtown Stuart since this is not how the SR707 bridge currently operates.  
We are very much opposed to a change in the current operation of the railroad bridge, especially one that is not equitable, unless the number of trains planned is suddenly going to mean that the bridge is down all the time.  In short, a bridge schedule that is unequitable, favoring rail traffic over waterway access, damages our community, introduces unsafe boating conditions, lowers our property values, and adversely affects marine businesses in the area.   Safety is our most immediate concern as I believe a schedule where the bridge is down the majority of the time will lead to boating collisions and injuries or worse.

We are looking to retire in 2 years and spend many hours on the water.  We are very upset about the significant limited access to this area through the proposed train bridge usage, becsuse we must go throught this area.  We  are concerned about boater safety/frustration as well as potential loss in property values. 

This area is already a bottle neck and already a safety concern as smaller boats navigate past larger ones waiting for the bridge to open. It will become much more dangerous, especially as frustrated boaters jocky for space in line in this constricted part of the waterway.  Because it is narrow and has significant current, only 1 large vessel can safely go through the bridge at a time, often leading to alternating which direction has the right of way.  If you now add a  significant length of time when the bridge is closed, this will literally become a nightmare. 

A significant increase in the proposed train traffic from approximately 10 to 40 trains, should not be allowed on the existing bridge because it seems the bridge will be open very little of the boater's day.  There needs to be be a more equal balance between train and boat use in this area.  We fully support the replacement of the existing bridge so that all larger motor boats can pass under without the need for bridge opening.  While a new bridge is constructed, it would be best to require the bridge stay open unless there a train using it to cross.  Also it must open quickly after the train passes, which unfortunately isn't even happening right now. It would be best to have a set schedule of when the bridge will be open so that significant number of boats can safely pass through, and boaters could plan accordingly.  We hope you consider our concerns and make regulations that allow a safe and enjoyable access to the lower St Lucie River and Intracoastal Waterway.

This means vessels will be queueing up and be forced to rush both eastbound and westbound putting at risk vessels and personal safety of vessel owners and guests.  Expecting this many vessels to safely float on a river with strong current while waiting for an opening is inviting disaster.  Additionally and to further cause backup of larger vessels.  They also require the opening of dixie hwy which will further reduce the passage windows and adding even greater delay and backup to floating vessels.  There is insufficient room to wait between the rail bridge and Dixie Hwy bridge.  This combined with the strong currents further increases risk for disaster, damage, and injury.

This waterway has been in use for decades and many have purchased property to the west for the purpose of boating and safely navigating east to cleaner water and the ocean.  Interrupting water passage for the local Stuart community is completely unfair.  Especially knowing the value of Brightline offers nothing to the community as it's not even stopping in Stuart.  Suggest the open and close times of the rail bridge be split no less than 50/50 and coordinated with concurrent opening of the Dixie bridge to allow vessels such as mine to safely pass without being run into by passing boats.  In addition, the current train schedule actually closes the rail bridge in excess of 10 minutes before the train even arrives.  This too needs to be factored into the down schedule of the bridge.",,,,,,,

Yes

(2)	 How often do you transit this waterway?  6-8 times weekly 

(3)	 If railway traffic impedes your navigation of this area, how long are you normally delayed? 20 minutes to up to an hour and a half once when the 
         antiquated bridge got stuck.

(4)   How would you propose to regulate the balance of railway and maritime traffic in this area? 
15min/hr is completely unacceptable.  At the minimum there should be equal amounts of time per 
hour for railway and boat traffic to pass through.  And, it should be split into 15 minutes  segments, not 30 minutes at a time.  This alone is not enough.  The best solution for the residents of Martin County is for the old train bridge to be replaced.as promised. How long, with all the additional raising and lowering of the bridge until it gets stuck, breaks or causes an accident?


(5)	What challenges have you experienced when transiting this area due to these bridges and/or 
railway activity?   As a new boater, I was forced to navigate at night when I was unprepared to do so because the train bridge got stuck in the down position.  I had plenty of time to get back before it got dark, however the ANCIENT bridge got stuck and I spent an hour and twenty minutes waiting to pass through and by then it was completely dark.  I never would have navigated at night, alone, without the knowledge or experience of having done so with someone else onboard first.  I was a nervous wreck and lucky I made it back to the marina without incident.  In addition, it’s a challenge to maneuver when the traffic backs up and the currents make it difficult to hold your position. 

(6)	Is a 15 minute hourly opening schedule sufficient for marine traffic? If not, please explain why. 
100% NO!  Without a 15/min hour restriction, it can already take that long to pass through.  What happens to all the boats that safely wait their turn or are forced out of the way and the 15 minute window is up?  Add the time they’ve already waited to another 45 minute cycle!  This is what’s going to happen, 15 minutes is not enough time.  This is going to lead to many accidents and possible casualties as people try to avoid this scenario.  By imposing this schedule, you are putting the residents of Martin County at risk of injury and possibly worse.  Weather comes quickly to this area and forcing us to stay on the water while waiting for the next bridge opening is reckless. Closing the bridge as Brightline is set to do is going to be detrimental to the boating lifestyle many of the residents of this area are accustomed to and it is most likely to have an impact on our property values and will adversely affect several marinas, restaurants and other businesses as well.

July 24, 2022

Ms. Jennifer Zercher
Bridge Management Specialist
Seventh Coast Guard District
Miami, FL
Jennifer.N.Zercher@uscg.mil

Thank you for the opportunity to provide input regarding the St Lucie Bridge / Train schedule.  

I recommend that for safety, economic and fairness aspects that the proposed bridge schedule be set to provide 30 minutes of open bridge access for boaters per hour for the following reasons.

Safety Issues and Impact
1.	The current proposal for the bridge to stay in an open position for only 15 minutes sets up a situation of extreme danger to the boating community. The only way that the estimated 70 boats passing through the bridge would be done safely and orderly would be if all 70 vessels were piloted by US Coast Guardsmen and not members of our local boating community.  
a.	Most boaters have little to no professional training on rules and regulations.  A “me-first, my boat is bigger, my boat is faster” attitude is often exhibited when on the water regardless of the rules. This creates an unsafe situation.
b.	A 15-minute window creates an extremely competitive situation where boaters are going to crowd the entrance to make sure they get through the bridge in the allotted window. Larger vessels are going to win in a competition with smaller vessels.
c.	The areas on either side of the bridge are not large enough to accommodate the volume of traffic that will gather waiting for the 15-minute window especially on the weekends, holidays and upcoming storm conditions. The current is also strong as the river narrows at the bridge making it difficult for boats to idle in a static position while waiting for the bridge to open. 
d.	If an accident happens that causes a vessel to be disabled or submerged near the bridge then it sets up a situation that could impede all traffic for hours or possible days depending on the size of the vessel. THIS BRIDGE/WATERWAY is the ONLY PRACTICAL ROUTE FOR BOATERS TO GAIN ACCESS TO THE INTRACOASTAL AND OCEAN WATERWAYS. THERE IS NO ALTERNATIVE ROUTE.  IT IS A SINGLE POINT OF FAILURE.

Business and Commerce Impact
1.	There are many businesses located west of the bridge that depend on expedient access to the Intracoastal and ocean waterways.  This includes boat maintenance facilities, new boat sales and marinas that each store or harbor hundreds of vessels. Their livelihood depends on customers being able to use their facilities for the storage and upkeep of their boats. Limiting these companies’ access to open water to only 15 minutes per hour negatively impacts their business.

Fair Use of the Public Waterways
1.	As previously stated… THIS BRIDGE/WATERWAY is the ONLY PRACTICAL ROUTE FOR BOATERS TO GAIN ACCESS TO THE INTRACOASTAL AND OCEAN WATERWAYS.  THERE IS NO ALTERNATIVE ROUTE.  IT IS A SINGLE POINT OF FAILURE.
2.	As a local resident I bought my home and boat for recreational use knowing that I could easily access the Intracoastal and ocean waterways. While a 15-minute window to pass under the bridge may sound reasonable, I have lived and used the train systems in many large cities and know that train schedules are subject to unexpected changes and delays.  A 15-minute window could easily dwindle down to 10 minutes or 5 minutes due to delayed train schedules.  This could happen any time of the day and compound the already competitive situation created by a large number of vessels waiting for the bridge to open.  If one window is missed that could likely double the number of vessels waiting to pass under the bridge in an already crowded area.  Who will monitor these delays?  How will the boating community be notified of impending delays?  Communication of schedule changes is only fair when a key single point of access is created.
3.	The bridge is over 100 years old.  It has never carried the proposed number or weight of trains in its existence.  Although deemed safe by experts I doubt that everyone would feel safe going under the bridge while trains are crossing – assuming their boat height would allow.  This likely will increase the number of smaller boats waiting for the bridge to open.
4.	When Brightline proposed their expanded use of the railways to accommodate schedules from Miami to Orlando, they stated that they would fund replacing the 100 year-old bridge with a newly constructed bridge 65 feet tall to eliminate the need to raise and lower a bridge.  Once they gained approval they walked back this commitment.  I feel like this was a true “bait and switch” effort just to gain approval.  
5.	To add insult to injury Brightline has not committed to having a stop on the Treasure Coast.  Why should we be impacted so heavily by a 45-minute closure when we have so little to gain by sharing our waterway with them? It just is not fair.

Thank you,

Re:  Docket # USCG-2022-0222; Restricted Access to St Lucie River by FEC RR and Dixie Hwy Brs

Ms. Zercher;

I request you reevaluate the negative safety and economic impacts that will occur if the subject bridges are only open 15 minutes/hour.

Seventy boats can NOT always transit safely and orderly.  It’s my understanding that the Coast Guard assumes up to 70 boats per proposed 15 minutes/hour open period can safely pass through the two bridges.  Based upon my 5 ½ years of boating experience through these two bridges, many times (especially on busy boating days) 70 boats could NOT make a safe and orderly transit.  For commercial and recreational boaters that reside west of these bridges, passage through these bridges is the only way to access the ocean and the ICW.  

The Treasure Coast’s economic vitality is directly dependent upon recreational and commercial boaters having minimal restrictions to its waterways.  The subject proposal to limit access on only 15 minutes per hour, through the FEC RR Bridge and Dixie Highway Bridge that cross the St. Lucie River in Stuart, will severely restrict boating through this choke point and therefore severely damage the local economy.  

While Brightline will provide an important transportation link between Miami and Orlando, Brightline should NOT be allowed to do so by degrading our local marine economy.  Brightline and other government sources should expeditiously be tapped to pay for the renewal and/or upgrade of these two bridges so they don’t restrict recreational or commercial boating.  

Sincerely

We need predictable times for the railroad bridge to be open for proper planning for her eating and sleeping schedule. We also need this because it is very tight under the bridge, the current is very strong and boating traffic is very heavy, so we cannot just sit and wait an hour for another opening. What if there is a storm and hundreds of boats are stuck out there in the elements and current? We need to be able to get back to our marinas/homes asap, so having a 15-minute opening will not allow for that. The bridge needs to be open for at least 30 minutes to allow for the traffic to pass in time and in a safe manner. 
We have been boating here for years and I hold a USCG 100-ton masters license, so we fully understand safe navigation, but having this bridge down for 45 minutes every hour will cause major safety issues and boaters will cause accident's, fight for their spot in line to pass under the bridge, etc. because the bridge won’t be open long enough for all of the boat traffic to pass through in 15 minutes. 
I read that the USCG will be there today, July 25th at noon to test if 70 boats can pass in 15 minutes, but it is a MONDAY and people are working so you may not get 70 boats on the water today. If you tried this on a Saturday at noon and every hour for the entire day, you would have a much better gauge on boat traffic and the bridge being accessible for passing through. We will be very concerned for our safety on our boat if the bridge is only open for 15 minutes because it will cause chaos in a very tight and heavy current area that will be very dangerous for our family and our boat.",,,,,,,

I submit these comments to the Supplementary NOI. I am a lifelong Floridian and boater with over 40 years boating experience. I live and dock my boat west of the FEC Bridge over the Okeechobee Waterway. I have over 15 years of personal experience navigating under the FEC and 707 bascule bridges in a boat that requires 8’ of vertical clearance. It is very common that passage through the SR 707, FEC and Roosevelt bridges (“the three bridges”) has been blocked solely by the FEC Bridge. The vast majority of the boats that travel this route are blocked when the FEC bridge is down. 
I totally agree with the statement in the U.S. Coast Guard (“USCG”) 2018 Waterways Analysis and Management System report that the FEC Bridge operation under the existing rule will be an UNREASONABLE OBSTRUCTION TO NAVIGATION. I am also concerned that the language of the initial NOI and apparent comments by USCG personnel relating to 15 minutes per hour for vessel navigation will INCREASE THIS UNREASONABLE OBSTRUCTION TO NAVIGATION. I make the following comments and suggestions:
:
1.NAVIGATION MUST BE GIVEN 30 CONSECUTIVE MINUTES EACH HOUR. A 30 consecutive minute time in each hour is warranted as the FEC Railroad Bridge has a horizontal clearance of only 50 feet and OWW marine traffic under the FEC Railroad Bridge includes large vessels, barges, sailboats and commercial equipment that may be only able to pass one at a time and whose passage is cumbersome. 
 The bridges are located on the OWW at its convergence with the two forks of the St. Lucie River and a large tidal embayment. This creates strong currents under these bridges. The areas around the bridges are open and impacted by wind. The three bridges are not aligned and the horizontal clearance under the FEC bridge is only 50 feet, making navigation a challenge for large vessels, sailboats which are typically under-powered and commercial traffic such as barges which regularly transit the OWW. I have personally witnessed barges take 10-15 minutes each to transit the three bridges even on a favorable tide. Sailboats are challenged and smart boaters give them room, slowing navigation.
 The initial NOI floated a suggestion that 15 minutes per hour was being considered. I have also been told that USCG personnel have suggested 50-70 boats could pass in a 15-minute period; frankly, that borders on ludicrous given the traffic, the tides and narrow clearance.
2 THE TIME FOR NAVIGATION MUST BE PREDICTABLE. Predictability in terms of the time each hour when the FEC Railroad Bridge is open and available for vessel traffic is essential for marine traffic.  Mariners must be advised of marine traffic of openings by way of an app, text message and internet page. But predictability is not a substitute for sufficient time each hour for navigation. Predictability reduces fuel usage, loitering time in areas affected by tide and wind, makes commercial operation efficient, as well as avoiding “road rage” by those unexpectedly caught by the FEC bridge. And again, telling the mariners when they will have a short window to pass, is not a substitute for a realistic amount of time for vessel traffic to pass. 
 The new rule must also consider that early weekend mornings and afternoons are peak times for recreational boating.
 The portion of each hour set aside by navigation must be consistent from hour to hour. Otherwise, a slot at the top of one hour and a bottom of the following hour creates an unacceptable period of no navigation.
3 THE SR 707 OPERATING SCHEDULE SHOULD AT A MINIMUM MIRROR FEC RAILROAD BRIDGE. The SR 707 Bridge operating schedule must mirror the FEC Railroad Bridge operating schedule. T
4 INCREASED TIME FOR NAVIGATION PRIOR TO THE ARRIVAL OF A TROPICAL CYCLONE. The OWW is a major marine hurricane escape route and regulation must provide for increased navigation time upon the approach of a tropical storm or hurricane as it is expected that when wind speeds reach certain levels the bridges will be locked down and closed to marine traffic that may be seeking to escape the approaching storm. 
As noted in the NOI, The U.S. Coast Guard Sector Miami Waterways Management Office conducted a Waterways Analysis and Management System (WAMS) review of the Intracoastal Waterway from miles 925-1005 in 2018. The WAMS included a focused review of the railroad bridges over the St Lucie River (OWW) and Loxahatchee River. The WAMS concluded that, with the addition of passenger rail service, the FEC Railroad Bridge over the OWW would create an unreasonable obstruction to navigation if operated under the current regulation, 33 CFR 117.317(c). Navigation under a rule providing for 15-minute period of each hour will only increase the obstructions and impacts to navigation. Navigation should have half of each hourly period, preferable a continuous time period that is not interrupted by bridge openings.
Respectfully, Michael Kennedy

That is dangerous and unfair. Having the bridge open twice per hour seems much more logical and fair. 15 minutes twice per hour would be fair. Even 10 minutes per opening would be better than the current proposal. ",,,,,,,

Thank you for this opportunity to respond as a boater, owner of an active yacht brokerage and member of the Marine Industries Association of the Treasure Coast.

Our economy and our local way of life depend on access to our waterways.

The railroad bridge should remain open thirty minutes of the hour giving equal access to boats and trains.
 
Our clients, yacht brokers, MIATC members and myself use this access on a daily basis. 
 
The wait time can range from five minutes to over thirty minutes with the normal delay being twenty minutes. Some waits have been over forty minutes.

The Florida East Coast Railroad bridge location in Stuart, FL is a high use traffic thoroughfare for both recreational and commercial vessels. This passage is also the only available east west access without requiring vessels to travel to Key West, FL
 
I support stationing an FWC, City of Stuart, Martin County or Coast Guard Auxiliary vessels on the downstream side of the bridge.  On high traffic days and time, also station a security vessel on the upstream side of the bridge.
I suggest you provide some means of prioritizing vessels access either by assigning numbers,  or allowing single screw (engine) vessel first access. 
Require vessels to stage a distance away from the bridge to avoid unsafe congestion while the bridge is closed
Ticket boats that attempt last minute dashes through a closing bridge. 
Allow no two way traffic.
 
I support immediately opening the bridge to vessel traffic a minimum of thirty minutes of every hour or every twenty minutes for a twenty minute period.
 
The A1A drawbridge needs to be staff by a trained bridge tender.

Thank you for considering my request.",,,,,,,

be strong.  The uncertainty of the status (open or closed) of the FEC railroad bridge and the relatively short notice given upon closing contributes to the confusion when navigating this narrow section of the waterway. To promote safety and predictability, I suggest
the RR bridge have a fixed 1/2 hourly opening schedule as so many low bridges do on the ICW and elsewhere.  This will promote a more orderly and safe progression of vessels under the bridge.  Additionally, this stretch of the waterway west to the the Indian Veterans Bridge is narrow and contains a blind curve in one of the narrowest sections (180 feet from
bank to bank).  Personally my vessel was damaged by wakes in this section.  To promote the safety of persons and vessels this heavily traveled and highly populated section
of the waterway should be designated a no wake zone.   Thank you for your consideration of these comments.

My vessel is 75 ft. And I am normally towing a 25 ft. Vessel.  The railroad bridge is already narrow and with a constant current it is not advisable for an east bound vessel and a west bound vessel to cross at the same time.  This bridge is adjacent to the Old Roosevelt Rd. Bridge which opens on the hour and half hour and stays open until all marine traffic has safely transited.  You can’t go through the Old Roosevelt Rd. Bridge unless the railroad bridge is open.  Keeping the railroad bridge open for 30 minutes continually each hour should suffice if it coincides with the schedule of the Old Roosevelt Rd. Bridge.

In ability to fairly pass is likely to increase traffic immediately adjacent to two Marinas and cause vessel's to operate with less care in the confined area. These are NOT the objectives of good rule making.  
(1) My wife and I are Florida residents and registered boaters that currently transit through the FEC Railroad Bridge crossing the Okeechobee Waterway, mile 7.4, at Stuart, Florida.
(2) We transit the waterway 5 to 50 times per year, more often when mooring our vessel at Burr Yacht Sales, or having refit done at a local ship-yard.
(3) To date delays have been +/- 15mins for railway traffic.
(4) Opening for 15 mins every half hour would fairly balance railway and maritime traffic.
(5) Excessively long closures causes stackup of vessel's; smaller boats often ignoring right of way by down-current vessel's = hazard to navigation.
(6) The two drawbridges should open simultaneously every half hour to meet the needs of marine navigation.
(7) The SR 707 (Dixie Hwy) Bridge schedule should absolutely mirror the operating schedule of the FEC Railroad Bridge!

In ability to pass the two bridges with regularity and predictability will cause us to perform more operating time inside the local waterways which are already in need of NO WAKE ZONES, specifically Inland of the Roosevelt Bridge heading toward the Okechobee lock - speading boats small and large now show disregard for their wake. Excess restrictions to navigation eastward I believe will amplify the already existing hazard.",,,,,,,

The railroad industry does not have a monopoly over transportation. Waterway transportation is most vital to Florida’s east coast, and safeguarding mariners’ use of our nation’s canals and waterways for transportation is crucial.  Keeping our rivers and waterways open is essential for safe navigation and transportation and for the economic, environmental, recreational, tourism, and commercial utilization of our waterways.
Commercial and recreational navigation of the St. Lucie River and Okeechobee Waterway would be most adversely impacted if the US Coast Guard approved the additional closing of the bridge for the proposed increased train traffic of the Brightline higher speed rail.  
Waterways are crucial junctures for Florida’s commercial and recreational boaters. The multi -billion dollar marine industry includes both small entities and major businesses. The disruption to navigation caused by proposed additional  Stuart FEC Railway bridge closures is unacceptable and will cause great economic and environmental detriment, and various boating safety concerns.  The Florida Department of Transportation and all interstate highways in Florida raise the height of their bridges to accommodate marine transportation--- so why isn’t the Brightline/ FEC Railway required to do the same? 
Boaters must not be “tolled” by any additional bridge closures created by Brightline/ FEC Railway. The United States Coast Guard must continue to stay focused on overseeing free use of the nation’s canals and waterways for the general welfare and for transportation.
Sincerely,
Anne Sinnott

Road traffic should be interfered with least of all.  It does not take long for a train to go past an intersection and they do it at regular times. For the one or two minutes at most that a train may be in an intersection the traffic can stop. 2.  Boats likewise can wait for a train to go through an intersection.  There is absolutely NO need for the train to block boat traffic because it goes through at varying moments throughout the day. Even trains can slow if they must, and not so many travel during a day that clear times when they are allowed and times they are not and likewise for boats can be established as long as neither has to wait for more than five or ten minutes, such as at a drawbridge when even road traffic, which should and must have priority over much less frequent water traffic, must wait for a bit for a boat to get through.

Brightline must be held accountable to fix this train bridge to quickly open and close.  This train bridge is extremely old and takes an extremely long time to operate.

If the bridge is only open 15 minutes per hour there is no way commercial and pleasure boat traffic will make it through in a safe and reasonable manner. Just today, during the bridge protest, we would not try to pass through the bridge as our boat is 22 1/2 foot beam. Larger boats just can’t go through at the same time that other boats are transiting under the bridge. This poses issues to not only pleasure boaters but to commercial traffic, first responders like Coast Guard, sheriffs office, fire rescue. While it is in evitable apparently that bright line will happen, it should not be  to the detriment and safety of the public.

In relation to the Drawbridge Operation Regulation- I am strongly against the adoption of ""more predictable schedule"" implementation for the reasons below. Safety is my primary concern, forcing boaters into a 15 minute window will strongly compromise boater safety. I personally have my family (wife and two daughters ages 6 and 3) onboard at least weekly going under the bridge and have seen very unsafe boaters trying to transverse the waterway before the bridge comes down. Further limiting the time will great increase these unsafe incidents. A regulation that prioritizes the rail is a regulation that is in direct conflict with the safety of boaters of all types. The bridge has a very narrow waterway and can only accommodate boats in one direction at a time. Having this one 15 minute window per hour is going to create a 'perfect storm' for waterway accidents. Imagine a single lane road with no lights or system to pass vehicles in opposing directions, while simultaneously creating a short window of time for its use. I urge you to give the waterway equitable time as to alleviate the unsafe conditions the current regulation creates.

After witnessing the bridge opening this morning, July 25, 2022 around 11:20a, I am compelled to comment for my third time about the current proposal of opening the Stuart railroad crossing for only 15 minute/hour.  As been stated in a least 50 comments, safety during weekends, holidays, or otherwise high traffic times will be greatly compromised by the urgency to get from one side to the other side of the tracks during a limited period of time which the tracks will be raised.  Since there is not an experienced bridge tender to make a judgement call on lowering the tracks, there is a heightened risk of vessel damage and human injury.  I have not read anywhere that there will be any safety personnel present, i.e., Martin County Sherriff Dept., Coast Guard Auxiliary or other Coast Guard vessel, or Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. It is stressful enough trying to navigate a vessel with oncoming traffic through the narrow opening without having to be concerned with 50 other boats surrounding  the area. 
Therefore I am respectively asking Admiral Fagan to;
1. Demand that FEC open the tracks 30 minutes/hour
2. Recommend that FEC raise the tracks to minimum height of 10ft at MHW.
3. Recommend that FEC pay for safety personnel during high traffic times such as weekends, holidays, or other high traffic times.

I applaud your participation in our local demonstration and sincerely hope that you were able to see first hand that amount of vessels stated by the Coast Guard passing through the railroad crossing in our area is not obtainable in the the alooed 15 minutes.

Thank you,

Additionally, i am a waterfront property owner on the west side of the bridge.  This geographic area is a boaters' paradise and growing significantly.  Navigating this passage has always been time consuming and somewhat precarious with the traffic and  currents..  With the increase in both train and boat traffic and the significant  increase in train length,  the situation is already getting worse.   The introduction of the high speed service will further exacerbate the situation. 
it was my understanding that bridges over navigable waterways are to open on call as documented in  CFR Title 33 , part 117.    Sub Part B earlier modified the subject bridge opening requirements that now give total control of openings to rairoad traffic.  Providing FEC, a commercial for profit Corporation with this control over an entire community and other supporting industries is not acceptable...  The current CFR needs to be amended to provide some measure of equity for all parties.

A minimum opening schedule of ten(10)  to fifteen(15) minutes each half hour if requested from early morning to late evening.  I am sure all the resources of FEC have the capability to facilitate this for their freight and high speed traffic. 
 
We all know the preferred solution would be a new bridge that was committed in their original proposal and since reneged

Like most permanent residents and guests of Martin County, I am an avid sportsman, enjoying
adventures on both my yacht sized and family run a bout sized boats.  Transiting the A!A and adjacent
railroad bridges with either boat has always been a challenge.  The upcoming increase in train traffic
will certainly move that challenge up to a dangerous level.  Packing both sides of these bridges with
boats subject to wind and tide conditions will increase the risk of collisions on the water.  
These bridges control boat traffic in one of the most boat active areas of the Intracoastal Waterway, the Saint Lucie Inlet and the “Crossroads” which gives us passage to the Gulf of Mexico, the only such passage in America.  Please give precedence to the importance of boat safety.  All boaters should have had more time to offer their input.  We need at least 15 minutes out of every half hour to provide a minimum of time for boat passages.  Trains run on schedules.  Pleasure boats, police, other government and rescue boats do not.   Our weather is often sudden and violent.  Please give us enough time to execute safe passages through this not so minor waterway obstruction.

I did attend the rally at the bridge on July 25, 2022.   I was one of the last boats thru the bridge.   I am 80 years old, pretty good shape and I have been boating since I was around 8 years old.   I monitored channel 9 today.  The group was well mannered, some were confused who had right of way.  One said on the weekend the thru bridge traffic is usually a free for all.  Very little of that today.  I think the boats moved thru the bridge better today than on a regular day.  The group was larger than usual.  We, the boaters, waterfront owners and boaters who traverse the bridge need access to the waterway.  Fifteen minutes an hour is not enough.  We really need a higher bridge, a bridge to meet the height of the Roosevelt car bridge. A higher RR bridge, a newer faster RR bridge would alleviate some problems. No matter what we need more openings.  Also an App that would tell of a approaching train would be of help.  I have spent many a wait  of 45 minutes or more  for old Rusty, Untrustworthy to open. Thank you",,,,,,,

As  long as I can remember, the train bridge closed in advance of a train, simple. After the train passed the bridge opened again. This system has worked for many many years. Why change it now. The answer is, someone or some group, that never has and probably will never in the future, use the waterway while boating, is trying to make the changes. They have no vested interest in the situation. They have never had to hold a boat against or with the current created by a changing tide. So, I say leave the operation as it has been. The train certainly open the bridge in enough time for it to pass. And, if not, we are all in trouble.

The key point is this is our waterway that supports our way of life and the health and welfare of our entire community. A schedule that acknowledges the primary needs of the local community should have priority over the trains that transit our community.  As such, in constructing the bridge’s operating schedule it should recognize the primary needs of our local merchants, businesses and residents. As such, the bridge should be up to allow boat and ship passage 60 percent of each daily hour. Under no circumstances should this be less than 50 percent.  As stated by numerous commentators, the damage to our local economy, neighborhoods, and most importantly, marine life, with a lesser percentage would be devastating. ",,,,,,,

I live on the North Fork of the St Lucie River and fish off shore as many as 3 times a month, hope to increase those numbers as I am getting ready to retire soon. My boat does not fit under the railroad bridge when it is down. Even now there have been times when I've had to wait as long as forty minutes for the bridge to open , which is far too long. Once it does there are back ups on both sides of the bridge jockeying to get through. A dangerous situation at best. There has to be a schedule that allows for a reliable schedule of openings that will keep the boat traffic from backing up and avoid the danger of boats trying to rush through before the next closure. I also own a business just a few blocks from Confusion Corner in Stuart. As a single lane bridge with double tracks on both sides I also see where trains will have to wait on both sides of the bridge as one passes over, then continue on once the first train passes. Keeping the bridge down for extended periods. Being the trains are both passenger and freight of different speeds and size this is a disaster waiting to happen. The city of Stuart will come to a literal stand still as freight trains are parked on the tracks waiting to cross. I've lived here long enough to have seen it happen when a train is stopped for hours in the city. The same will be for north in Rio and Jensen Beach. This has been a VERY BAD IDEA from the beginning and will only prove to get worse. ",,,,,,,

FEC owns the rights to the land and the tracks but not the St Lucie River. It was long navigable by boat before the railroad. 
The rail bridge obstructs navigation. It must be able to be in down position when trains are passing. That rail bridge and  mechanisms are nearly a century old. As with any mechanical device that old and exposed to the coastal elements it will eventually fail. It is not reliable to cycle up to estimated 20+ times daily. The tax paying residents and valuable local marine industry should not be made to suffer to accommodate the business interests of a private company by allowing  controlling of a public waterway possibly as its way to avoid the more costly alternative of replacing the aged bridge crossing .

Yes.

(2) How often do you transit this waterway?  I transit under this bridge crossing at least 2-3 times per week.

(3) If railway traffic impedes your navigation of this area, how long are you normally delayed? Railway traffic absolutely impedes my navigation and makes travel more unsafe for myself and all other boaters. More often than not, multiple vessels attempt to inject themselves into the line to ""beat"" the bridge closing which sometimes leads to two boats attempting to cross under the bridge overpass simultaneously. This has led to several near misses that I have witnessed. I am sure there have been actual casualties, thankfully none that I have experienced firsthand or witnessed. On several occasions, I have been stuck behind the bridge tempers have flared and escalated. This is with an operational schedule that is much more forgiving than what is being proposed. I fear that, in addition to making travel much more unsafe for myself and my family, it will absolutely hinder, and in some cases cause loss of use for many boaters. Due to what appears to be a very lackadaisical schedule, I have been caught behind the bridge for as little as 20 minutes, but on occasion, as much as 45 minutes. Oftentimes, the train passed and the bridge remained down for a period of 20 minutes more. All the while boats are piling up at either side of the bridge waiting for their opportunity to squeeze in. 

(4) How would you propose to regulate the balance of railway and maritime traffic in this area? The use times should be fair and reasonable. This should allow an equal split at minimum-30 mins closed versus 30 mins opened. In addition, there should be real-time updates and verifiable opening and closing times that are readily accessible for boaters to monitor for travel planning. I would imagine additional security measures should be implemented, such as: laser sensors that prohibit bridge closing if any objects or vessels are transiting at the time the bridge engages its descent, more prominent and visible lighting of the rail bridge (adding a visual indicator of a 5-minute warning such as a yellow blinking light at the top of the bridge when it is in its fully open state and planning decent).

(5) What challenges have you experienced when transiting this area due to these bridges and/or railway activity? As mentioned before, tempers have flared and this will undoubtedly lead to more frustrated boaters. Physical altercations, additional safety hazards leading to an increased potential for accidents, delays in emergency response, shelter from inclement weather, loss of use and enjoyment, races to ""beat "" the bridge. 

(6) At what frequency and duration should the drawbridge openings occur in order to meet the needs of navigation? See item 4. 30 mins open - 30 mins closed.

(7) Should the SR 707 (Dixie Hwy) Bridge opening schedule mirror the operating schedule of the FEC Railroad Bridge? There is no purpose for this bridge with the Roosevelt bridge making the very same connection. Get rid of it and save some taxpayer dollars. 

Question: what additional tax revenue is to be gained by the state/county with the additional use of the railway by Brightline? Similarly, for those of us that live on the waterway and pay a significant tax premium as a result of increased property values, what kind of tax relief will be offered for the loss of use and enjoyment should the bridge schedule become untenable?

On several occasions, and with the strong tidal flow, I have seen boats in near collision conditions. These near collision conditions are much more frequent when the RR bridge is down for an extended period of time.

I believe a much safer condition would exist if the RR bridge could be left in the open position for at least 10 to 15 minutes every half hour and that the Dixie Hwy. bridge would open on demand.  The vehicle traffic on Dixie Hwy. is usually light due to most vehicles using the high rise US 1 bridge.  

Thank you for the opportunity to submit my comments.

Sometimes it is just a short wait when the trains comes through but there have been times when that wait was over two hours because they did not raise the bridge between trains.  That is totally unacceptable.  Having the bridge only open for fifteen minutes every hour would be very inconvenient and cause huge backups.  There are a significant number of boats on the west side of the bridge that would be impacted as well as traffic traveling on the waterway.  I’m not sure how someone concluded that 70 boats could pass through in 15 minutes.  In my experience that would not be the case.  Depending on the size of the boats and if there is traffic for both directions it could take much longer.  If the bridge can not open and close when necessary for the trains, then I would say give equal time each hour to boats and trains.  ",,,,,,,

As a recreational boater, such a limitation seriously inhibits our ability to use and enjoy the waterfront area. It encourages all boaters to run as fast as their boats allow to race up to the staging area so they can make the passage during the alloted time.  The railroad bridge looks like it it 100 years old, it is rusted, decaying and clearly should be replaced. So how it is that this is not part of the Brightline Project. How is it that the project was approved without requiring a new bridge. Not providing a new bridge that permits everyone to use our natural resource is just simply not fair nor a good idea. i do not need to inform the coast guard that pleasure boats regardless of their size do not behave like cars in a restricted/small area or at slow speeds. They will not be able to stay in a line, they are affected by the tide, the wind and a host of other elements.  If the pleasure boats are restricted to grouping for 45 minutes before the bridge goes up, how are they going to que up and not start colliding with each other? Who is going to say who is first? or who should go next. This proposal is a disasteous idea with accidents and potentially loss of life waiting to happen. Brightline should be required to replace this aging relic with a modern bridge that allows everyone to have free transit. Limiting the recreational boater while the most cost effective solution for  Brightline will not work as a practical matter.

Keeping the RR bridge down for more time than it is open will cause a greater risk to boaters and the general public. With the large amount of marine traffic that navigates this area it is simply not feasible for only 15 minutes per hour to be passable. Furthermore, the time it takes to navigate a vessel with any level of restricted maneuverability through this narrow channel will further cause a very dangerous situation. Reference USCG NAVIGATION RULES AND REGULATIONS Rule 9 (Narrow Channels),

Thank you.

The water clearance for the R/R trestle is very limited when down and even small boats with a T-Top cannot make it under.  The trestle opening is also very narrow, and the current is strong. It can be dangerous under good conditions when larger vessels are moving in the opposite direction. Limiting the opening to 15 minutes each hour will cause chaos, especially on holiday weekends. Police, Marine Patrol or the Coast Guard will need to perform traffic control or people will get killed.
I know Brightline is spending millions of dollars building new and improving the tracks. It is not unreasonable to force them to raise the trestle clearance to a height that would allow the majority of water craft to pass. Did they perform a feasibility study, if not why?

I fully understand the need for rail travel and instituting a more predictable bridge schedule.  However, raising the bridge for only 15mins per hour will greatly impact both recreational and commercial use of the waterway.  The railway bridge channel is inadequate for the amount of boat traffic that will be attempting to navigate through in a 15min.window.  The bridge channel is exceedingly narrow for two directions of simultaneous boat traffic.   Add in wind , current and wakes to the backed up marine traffic, and this will quickly become a unnecessarily dangerous situation.
Having a railway bridge only open for 15 minutes per hour may work in some locations, although, this is not one of them.  Safety is my main concern and additional conditions would need to be addressed prior to safely implementing the current proposed schedule.  Thank you

*Long infrequent openings will congest the waterway with boats waiting for passage. The channel is narrow, curved and the current often runs rapidly and it runs at an angle to the channel. This will be an unnecessary hazard to navigation.
*The train tracks have a sharp ""S"" curve north of the bridge which requires the train to slow down to about 25 miles per hour. Therefore, the argument that safety for highspeed trains requires the bridge to be down long before the train is ready to pass is a bogus argument.
*Years ago, Bright Line said that would have a smart phone app available to boaters that would display the rail traffic and show the predicted time of the bridge closures. Where is this app?
*Small boat traffic congestion could, AND SHOULD, be reduced by raising the wires that droop between each of the bridge stanchions.
*The coast guard must monitor the bridge closings and railroad traffic to protect the interests of navigation from being abused by the railroad.
*The Bright Line business plan is destined to fail. When it fails all bridge closure agreements should be reviewed and renegotiated.

This is so for many reason such as public safety, commerce, and economic concerns.  Brightline relys on federal railroad chronological primacy to bully all other concerns.  The 15 minutes that are being offered are only because of public outcry not magnanimity.  You, the Coast Guard have a responsibility to the rest of the population to balance all needs.    A significant portion of the requested closure is due to the extended time it takes a more than 100 year old bascule bridge to open and close and not due to increased train traffic. Simply put this should not be allowed. 

They should be required to improve the bridge (raise as well as speed up its opening and closing time).  I realize that gaining the required grade to raise the bridge will be costly.  They did borrow nearly $2B from the federal government to improve the tracks for their needs.  If they get what they want they will never make an effort to improve the bridge at a severe cost to the Treasure Coast community.  The property value destruction of waterfront homes to the west of the bridge will be enormous and the marine industry will also take a huge financial hit. Every business owner and citizen will suffer financially as well as a have a reduced quality of life here because this community relies on the waterfront even by people who aren’t “on the water”.  

I go through the bridge regularly on my boat and your estimate of 22% (which I believe is incorrectly high)of all boats west of the bridge will fit under the bridge in its current condition is a misdirection. To the extent that those boats are not tenders to larger boats they already avoid the open bridge due to larger boat traffic in the channel.  
1 or 2 large yachts from the marinas west would completely use the 15 minutes and nobody else would get through. And what about a barge? It might not even be able to make it through in the 15 minute window.  How would a train stop for that? 

Due to the conditions on the east side of the bridge with the new Roosevelt bridge limiting where boats can wait it is very dangerous and shallow.  There literally is no where for that many boats to wait unless they go a long way back in both directions in the channel.. This is not safe and you should not allow it in the federal waterway.  
Even currently when the bridge is closed for 15 minutes I have seen dozens of boats on both sides stack up.  It takes far more than 15 minutes to clear the traffic.   There is no way everyone would get through under there new proposed operations. I could spend most of my Saturday or Sunday just waiting to get through the bridge to go fishing, visit the sandbar or patronize one of the many restaurants east of the bridge or visit downtown Stuart by boat.

There must be federal regulations governing the closure of waterways that can be used to force Brightline to allow for more boat traffic.    
Brightline is not being a responsible member of the Florida community and you should not let them close the bridge for 75% of every hour.

I say safely because we all know the traffic jam caused by the proposed time limit of 15min will create chaos on the water for all of the taxpayers trying to get though that section. Not to mention getting emergency services through to assist on the north fork. Last time I checked Brightline isn’t a taxpayer nor are they able to sustain themselves on passenger fare because there is no demand. So why interrupt the waterways utilized by taxpayers for a bloated, unsustainable, under utilized train service? Solution: give Brightline 15min to get over the bridge and 45min to the taxpayers to pass safely to their destinations. Problem solved!

Has anyone at the coast guard sat and surveyed the vessel count coming and going through that passage daily Year round? If so post the study.",,,,,,,

We both live on the water in Stuart and Palm City, and are boaters.. There is no way in fifteen minutes that you can pass safely 70 boats thru the railroad bridge in Stuart. At the 11 am opening today in fifteen minutes approximately twenty five boats passed thru and it was not very safe. At the 11:30 opening it was about 25 that passed thru the bridge west to east in the first fifteen minutes, and over the next fifteen minutes about another 25 boats.  There were over 100 boats in the flotilla today. It was not very safe. So how is it going to be safe trying to get 70 boats thru in fifteen minutes?
The best short term solution is have a fifteen minute opening every half hour. 
The second issue is the bridge itself. As I looked at this 100 year old rust bucket today from my sons boat, you can see it is an accident waiting to happen, and it would not be good if and when it collapses from the high speed train.
Thirdly I have spend 35 years in the marine industry 22 of them with MarineMax. It would devastate the Marine Businesses west of the bridge having to wait for an opening once per hour. When they do their test runs with clients any kind of unsafe situation like this have a high percentage of people walk away from a boat purchase. This would not help the local tax revenue, or the sate of llorida. 
The fourth issue is when I would participate in the Palm Beach Christmas Boat Parade you typically would have 20-25 boats safely pass thru in fifteen minutes which would favor the opening of the railroad bridge every thirty minutes.",,,,,,,

The South Fork of the river and its bascule bridges are to serve priority to the canals purpose for commercial and pleasure craft alike. The St.Lucie river channel is the designated contiguous waters of US, the Army Corps' canal and locks system. The Coast Guard has the authority over all others in this matter to:
1. Provide and maintain navigational aids of the waterways is the responsibility of the Coast Guard. The train bridge has but one single Green and Red light low to the water viewing is blocked by bridge or not visible for most boats that are staging at the required safe distance until the vessel is committed to transit the open bascule bridge channel. At this point vessels are trapped constrained by depth, CBD, and in strong current in a channel under the three bridges. Advance notice or warnings for a rail bridge closing and opening is needed by Sound, Signs, Markers, and or Countdown clock for 32 trains a day. Simply there is no notice much less advance notice that are required especially for the cross Florida barge canal and the contiguous waters of the St. Lucie River to the Atlantic inlet.
2.The rail bridge dictates all of Roosevelt bridges openings. There is no coordination of the rail bridge with Roosevelt bridge opening. The Roosevelt bascule bridge is dependent and has subordinated its responsibility to open to the dictates of an unmanned train bridge for the ""Safe"" passage of vessels. 
3. Bridge opening times posted, tide markers for bridge height clearance restored. 
4. Right of way: few if any boaters and Bridge Tenders understand or communicate right of way under bridges or restricted canals. This was proven today by a fleet of boats that radioed to the tender who has right of way? This is the most dangerous, misunderstood or not trained knowledge of boaters old and new.  The tidal or river current flow direction dictates right of way in a one way only first passage. Collisions, accidents inevitable if boats, especially new boaters that are not made aware of Right of way of if the eastbound or westbound has right of way to pass. Right of way changes with every tide. This the most dangerous aspect of the exceedingly narrow train bridge canal. Roosevelt is a single boat width wide Rail bridge canal. 
Bridge Tenders must add Right of Way to their VHF verbal bridge opening warning to prevent accidents.

In that particular area the North and the South forks of the St. Lucie converge.  The navigable channel narrows at that location and boaters have to pass thru/under 2 bridges in a span of less than 200 feet.  In addition, at certain tide changes, the current in that area can become quite strong, thus making navigation even more difficult.  
Having the FEC Bridge open to vessels for just 15 minutes every hour is not just a question of inconvenience, it is a serious safety issue.  Currently, when the bridge is down for an extended period (waiting for 2 trains to pass) vessels on both sides of the bridge accumulate very quickly. I have personally witnessed a very large number of vessels on each side of the bridge “ stack up” waiting for the bridge to open. With that many vessels in a confined area, with the current running, it becomes hazardous very quickly.  
Additionally, having the bridge down ( or “closed” to vessel traffic) for a period of 45 minutes every hour will restrict emergency vessels from being able to respond in a timely manner.
It appears most of these issues could be avoided by simply having the FEC Bridge open to vessel traffic for 15 minutes out of every 30 minutes.  That would allow the trains to pass and   avoid the large congregation/congestion of vessels waiting, that currently occurs when the bridge is down for 30 - 40 minutes.  Please consider this serious safety issue when making this important decision for all those that traverse our waterway. Thank you.

Its hard to support a plan that brings nothing to Stuart other than increased wait times. Maybe I’m ill-informed, but i find it extremely hard to believe there will be  substantial ridership transiting from South Florida to Orlando on a daily basis. Essentially the residents of Stuart and Palm City will be forced to sacrifice their quality of life for literally no benefit to them. Brightline has been a joke since its inception. What started as a promising project that would have allowed convenient traveling from Orlando to Miami, is now more of  a tourist attraction for train enthusiasts because it has so few useful stops.

Now that enthusiasm is about to be destroyed.  I don’t understand the math with Brightline’s 15-minute window imposed upon us boaters.
   
It takes about 2 minutes for the unmanned Railroad bridge to fully open/close.  Where in the proposal does this 2 minute opening/closing period subtract from?  If it is from the boaters, then it leaves only 11 minutes to navigate through 3 bridges – the Old Roosevelt drawbridge, the Railroad bridge, and the new Roosevelt bridge. Navigation through these narrow channels is difficult enough let alone having the additional pressure of the Railroad bridge crashing down upon your vessel or trapping you between the bridges.  

And what about the freight trains?  Where are they calculated into Brightline’s proposal?    More thought and research needs to take place before making such a decision.

Boating  safety and right away is more important as you can’t predict weather conditions and currents passing in this very small area as no one can predict the number of boats. 

Let brightline pass in 15 minutes every hour boaters need the right away not Brightline the trains are empty every time they pass. What if a boater has a medical condition, injury or episode who is responsible if coast guard can’t get through to assist medical attention? 

Completely against this and question the injuries this could cause to boaters rushing in an area that is already very tight with boating traffic.

We use the waterway often for recreational boating and sometimes as a means of transportation.  The challenges relating to the bridge are two-fold: navigating the narrow passageway with a lot of boat traffic and holding your position while waiting for the bridge to open. Both of these will be significantly compounded if the train bridge is down for more than 30 minutes per hour. 
When the train bridge goes down, or when it is closing while we are approaching it, the delay is no less than 25 minutes.  Oftentimes the bridge is closed and we wait 10 minutes before a train crosses, and then it takes another 10 minutes for the bridge to return to an upright position.  The bridge is old and dilapidated and should be replaced with something higher and more time efficient. When the bridge is down and everyone is waiting on their boats for it to open, it is incredibly challenging to hold your position in the water.  Between current, tides, wind and boat traffic, it can become treacherous as sometimes we get blown close to the concrete pilings of the Roosevelt bridge or to the shallow banks of the shore. Add in irresponsible boaters, jet skiers and those who feel they don't need to wait in line to pass, and it's downright dangerous. When large boats (sailboats, sport fisherman) or emergency boats or rescue boats are passing through, no one else can pass at the same time.  
The railroad bridge should be open AT LEAST half an hour, every hour.  That's the only way to safely move everyone through the passage.  Ideally, it would be open 45 minutes each hour, in divided intervals, so everyone doesn't pile up waiting for the bridge to open up. 
Additionally, rescue vessels are stationed on the western side of the bridge and limited opening will delay their access to assist boaters on the water to the east of the bridge.  
Railroad traffic shouldn't dominate nor dictate the bridge schedule; it should be equitable for all involved. 
The Dixie Hwy Bridge doesn't need to mirror the operating schedule of the FEC Railroad Bridge because it is higher and allows greater passage for boats.  That said, there is an option for drivers to use the Roosevelt Bridge without much diversion, so aligning the openings of the two bridges makes sense to eliminate the backup of boat traffic on the water.

The short duration of openings will force large volumes of marine traffic into a bottle neck situation in an area with strong currents, and no good place to avoid traffic in between the two bridges. To endanger one form of transportation to protect another is a mistake, concessions must be made to ensure safety of navigation, especially when you’re working with a bridge that doesn’t even have a bridge tender. Closings are controlled from a railroad control center adding even more danger to the mad rush of fifteen minutes to clear the span. Inevitably this will lead to the boating public taking dangerous and potentially deadly actions to make the opening. You can see evidence of this anywhere you have controlled bridges, but with bridge tenders you at least have a safety in place to try and prevent tragedy. Between the overall danger, the high probability of economic impact for marine businesses west of the bridge, potential for loss of property values for waterfront owners, and impact on vessels transiting across the state via Lake Okeechobee especially during hurricane season the decision to move forward with the proposed bridge schedule would be a huge mistake that has a very real potential to endanger the lives of those transiting the area.",,,,,,,

During those times numerous boats of all sizes accumulate on both sides of the bridges waiting for the bridges to open.  Waiting in the tight quarters and often high currents results in a lot of stress since everyone is just milling around and wants to get through quickly and safely.  Because of the structures of the bridges, it is impossible to see through them in either direction to see oncoming traffic and once you get between the bridges, it is virtually impossible to stop – you have to keep moving forward.  The opening in the FEC bridge is only about 48 feet wide which prevents two boats to safely pass through simultaneously.  The Roosevelt Bridge opening is better, but still only about 88 feet wide so two smaller boats might pass, but still a safety challenge.  Since to opening spans of the bridges do not line up, there also are heading changes required to pass through both bridges.  On busy boating days (weekends and holidays), it is likely that dozens of boats could accumulate on both sides of the bridges which would require at least 30 minutes of the FEC bridge being open for all boats to pass through.  From a boating safety standpoint, the FEC bridge operating schedule should provide at least 30 minutes of opening time per hour and will require some coordination with Roosevelt Bridge operations.",,,,,,,

There is significant daily marine traffic through the railroad's drawbridge which is quite narrow such that larger boats can barely pass in opposite directions.  The Corps of Engineers indicates about 10,000 vessels pass through the St. Lucie Lock annually, with most also passing the St. Lucie rail bridge.  There is even more local traffic through the rail bridge between the ICW and Palm City and Port St. Lucie. 

USCG issued an operating order for the rail bridge crossing the New River in Fort Lauderdale specifying that the bridge should allow marine traffic to pass for at least 60 minutes of each 2 hour period.  There should be a similar protocol at the rail bridge in Stuart.

The railroad has previously said it expects 32 passenger and 20 freight trains will eventually pass through Stuart daily, most between the hours of 7am and 11pm. This amounts to approximately 3 trains each hour.  The rail bridge takes several minutes to open or close and must be in the down position several minutes before a train is expected to pass and freight trains, which typically have up to 150 cars, take several minutes to pass. Thus each train passing through will result in the waterway being blocked for perhaps 15 minutes.  Three trains per hour would thus leave the waterway open to navigation only 15 minutes of each hour, divided into brief segments of just a few minutes each.  
This would represent an unacceptable restriction of marine traffic.
Property values and marine and water dependent businesses will be significantly damaged if this restriction of marine traffic is allowed.

I therefore urge the Coast Guard to promulgate regulations that would result in an approximately equal and equitable sharing of opportunity for rail and marine traffic to pass through Stuart, particularly during hours of daylight.

I was born in Stuart in the 1950’s and grew up spending a lot of time in and on the St. Lucie River. I know how important the river is to our community in terms of our culture and our economy. We are a water oriented town with many people relying on our rivers and ocean for jobs and recreation. 
 I am concerned about the proposal to severely limit the times that boats can pass under the Roosevelt bridge. Besides the negative effect that would have on our boating community it would create safety issues as well. Imagine boats stacked up in the shallow areas surrounding the channel on both sides of the bridge. It is difficult as is to have boats passing in opposite directions without the pressure of such a short timed opening of the railroad bridge. Prioritizing trains over our boaters is unfair and could be dangerous. 

Please consider a schedule that will be fair to our community. 

Thank you for your consideration,

On behalf of Isle Royale National Park, I would like to submit comments on the Drawbridge Operation Regulation that was implemented during the summer of 2022. 
1. The M/V RANGER III, which is owned and operated by the National Park Service and services Isle Royale as a passenger and cargo ferry, has been operating in the Keweenaw Waterway since the ship's inception in 1958. During this time, the NPS has enjoyed a great relationship with the cities of Houghton-Hancock and the lift-bridge that links the two. The Ranger III has, on many occasions, altered it's schedule to accommodate requests from the lift-bridge for the purpose of traffic flow. We were quite surprised by this regulation and feel that there was not any opportunity for stakeholder input prior to implementation, which would typically be done before a rule alteration.

2. This experimental rule had very negative effects on Ranger III operations. Specifically, the regulation that forced us to move the Ranger III through the lift bridge only on the hour and half hour caused a delay in arrival back in Houghton on nearly every single inbound trip for the duration of the rule. This delay caused the crew to have to work overtime in order to complete unloading operations at the end of the day, which would otherwise be completed during their standard work day.  The delay also increased the ships fuel consumption for the inbound trip. Though marginal, this increase over the full summer operating season became significant. Together, the overtime and fuel costs added up into the tens of thousands of dollars.  

3. Along with a large monetary cost to Isle Royale National Park, there was also a signficant inconvenience to our passengers who come from all over the world to visit Isle Royale. Upon their return our passengers need to travel to airports etc on a specific timeline. Delays to our published arrival time put many  of our passengers behind schedule. 

4. We at Isle Royale understand the desire to minimize the number of lifts that the bridge does in a day. Everyone who lives in our area has been delayed by a bridge opening at one time or another. But in our opinion, this rule really didn't change much. There was only one time over the duration of the rule that another vessel crossed under the bridge span during the same lift as the Ranger III. In the past, using the bridgetenders discretion we have been able to do similar shared lifts with other vessels without the need for this specific regulation. 

5. Upon discussion with Houghton Police Chief John Donnelly, a representative of the City of Houghton, there was never intent by the city to include the Ranger III, a commercial vessel, in this rule when they made the request to DOT. The intent was for this to apply to recreational vessels. 

6.As a commercial vessel with a published departure and arrival times, the experimental rule impacted us negatively. If it is decided that this experimental rule should become permanent, we at Isle Royale National Park would ask that the Ranger III be exempted from the rule moving forward. 

Respectfully, 

Aaron Persenaire

If this rule is adopted then it will change the scheduled time for the opening of the drawbridge in between Houghton and Hancock MI, which has happened multiple time in the past to address the same issue, traffic. This drawbridge has attempted multiple times to solve the traffic problem, but it only ends up hurting the boating companies through workers having to wait for the bridge, then stay late to unload the boats. This cause the boat companies tens of thousands of dollars with the extra overtime and excess burned fuel.  ",,,,,,,

Docket #USCG-2022-0259.


Given this subject addresses vessels under 20’ where there is NO requirement for licensing or training in safe vessel operation including advanced electrical systems as found on electrically powered vessels, I recommend and urge Federal regulations requiring a mandatory annual multi-point inspection of batteries and systems to include verifying function of safety devices, sensors for temperature, voltage and amperage limiting devices and systems and other control and safety functions. That batteries meet UL requirements, are secured and located to prevent submersion by normal bilge water levels. Verify vessel has functioning fire suppression equipment.
Furthermore, I recommend the above for all electrically powered vessels, regardless of battery type.
USCG to issue sticker to affix to exterior of vessel indicating pass/fail/compliance.

Submitted Respectfully
Captain Mitch Witt",,,,,,,

If you want to go on the water get a kayak, canoe, paddle board, or kite surfer which uses no rare earth materials to manufacture or operate. Maybe allow senior citizens and disabled people on motorized recreational crafts, but Americans need to exercise more and consume less.",,,,,,,

I have a few things to say about this proposed rule but first I would like to say I do support it. Referring to section III paragraph A., where it discusses the planning that went into this to give vessels enough time to ask for permission to enter the zone at this time which also gives them enough time to review the reasons and whether or not the vessel should be allowed is a reasonable part of the rule to have and shows people can be allowed to be in the zone if granted permission so if a vessel urgently needs to get through the zone at this time, they can. Next referring to section III paragraph F., where it discusses the environmental impact is where most of my opinion comes from because I actually believe by allowing vessels to enter this zone during the show could be more of a threat to the environment than not allowing vessels through. Fireworks release ashes and sometimes pieces fall that are still ignited so if one of these pieces falls on a passing vessel and catches the vessel on fire which then sends debris and a vessel under water, not only endangering the humans on the vessel but endangering the aquatic life below the water as well. So I believe by not allowing the vessels to pass at this time, which is only about 3 hours, is smart to the environment and the people on the vessels. The time is so short as well with it only being 3 hours, if a vessel needs to be through this water urgently I believe with this rule being proposed giving plenty of time for a small entity as referred to in section III paragraph B, to have enough time to plan to be through this zone before or after the given time zone. Overall I think due to the danger that fireworks can cause I believe this zone being cut off for the time of the show is a good idea and is safe for the people around because every firework show that goes on takes caution with making sure there is no one near the blast off zone in case of a mishap so there should be no difference here. Fireworks are very dangerous and a lot of people are aware that they can burn you, cause you to go blind if it gets in your eye, start fires, and many more things can happen if handled wrong so I think it would be best to keep everyone out of this area for the time being.

A fireworks show is one of the best ways we celebrate our country on July 4th and who better to put that on than the men and women who serve our great nation. Amidst the hardships of the past few years with the pandemic, a fireworks show for the 4th is exactly the kind of event that families and members of the communities need to reconnect and relive the glory days of what life was before the pandemic. This safety zone is also a great idea to prevent any fires that could occur from falling debris. One night of interruption will not severely impact the transportation of goods on this route. There is no way that a fireworks show that will only last for 30 minutes could have detrimental effects on the nearby industries. This kind of event is necessary not only for the community but for those who serve our country. This commemorates the lives that have been sacrificed for the lives we live today. ",,,,,,,

A thriving seaport is critical to the economy of Northeast Florida, and the entire State, with over 26,000 direct and indirect jobs relying on JAXPORT's activity. Therefore, having uninterrupted vessel traffic to and from JAXPORT is imperative. While review the proposed rule, JAXPORT sought insight from the St. Johns Bar Pilots, who are charged with navigating vessels on the St. Johns River. The proposed temporary safety zone for the Jacksonville region is approximately 65 nautical miles northeast of Jacksonville. The current and proposed shipping lanes to and from JAXPORT are not impacted by the proposed temporary safety zone. It was the opinion of the St. Johns Bar Pilots that the proposed temporary safety zone will not cause an impact on the un-interrupted travel of vessels to or from JAXPORT. Therefore, JAXPORT has no objection to the proposed temporary safety zone in this Proposed Rule that is 65 nautical miles northeast from Jacksonville. We will continue our cooperative relationship with the United States Coast Guard to ensure safe, efficient maritime operations.",,,,,,,

One instance would be if malfunctions occur with cameras and detection devices, vessels could be held up at the bridge, unable to pass. This could result in a theft of valuable items held on said vessels and puts safety of crew members at risk.While the plan follows the bridge schedule from before, any malfunctions with equipment would not be able to combat unexpected problems such as unscheduled vessels and emergency situations. I found the proposed rule did not clearly address the advantages and benefits of controlling this bridge remotely.

(2) How often do you transit this waterway? Several times per day

(3) If railway traffic impedes your navigation of this area, how long are you normally delayed? The delay can be as long as 20 - 30 minutes.

(4) How would you propose to regulate the balance of railway and maritime traffic in this area? A posted schedule with equitable time given to maritime and railway traffic

(5) What challenges have you experienced when transiting this area due to these bridges and/or railway activity? The width of the railway passage is quite narrow and is often only safely navigable by one boat at a time. On weekends, I've observed as many as 20 boats waiting on either side. This tends to create an unsafe condition where boats from both directions are rushing to make the passage.

(6) At what frequency and duration should the drawbridge openings occur in order to meet the needs of navigation? Ideally, it would be great if there was no train bridge but at the very least it would be safer if the passage way was wider and the bridge was higher off the water. Since that may be a long way in the future, it would only be fair to allow equal time for maritime and railway traffic.

(7) Should the SR 707 (Dixie Hwy) Bridge opening schedule mirror the operating schedule of the FEC Railroad Bridge? I think an on demand schedule for the Dixie Hwy bridge works. While the Dixie hwy bridge is down it allows for smaller boats to make the passage and get out of the way of the larger vessels.",,,,,,,

As a multi-mission branch of the military responsible for aids to navigation and protecting the maritime environment including safety, the United States Coast Guard allows safe and lawful waterway activities through an established marine event process.  This includes designating certain safety zones such as those established under 33 CFR Part 165 for an event on August 20, 2022 on Lake Erie near Cleveland, Ohio.

The navigable waters from North Coast Harbor into East Basin Channel can be challenging even in fair weather so it is important that any permit issued include the requirement that is effectively enforced that participants are required to cooperate with U.S. Coast Guard personnel and law enforcement officers.  The Coast Guard does have authority to use its personnel and facilities to assist state and local agencies since their personnel are especially qualified to perform particular activities.

This event has been held for several years.  Swimmers have been found to sometimes be disoriented, possibly by specular reflection of light from the surface of the water at the time the event is held, which is 7:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m. local time.   It is important that buoy sighting and pertinent fixed or floating Marine Event In Progress or similar signage be prominently arranged so that is the highest level of visibility to participants.  

Safety and maritime security issues rank high in Coast Guard protocol.  These special events can be challenging and somewhat unpredictable.  Public comments should be reviewed, relevant recommendations examined and the proposal for a temporary safety zone be considered for approval.

I believe having this regulation during any triathlon in Louisville would be very beneficial as an official floating regulation. The Coast Guard could make it a requirement that events provide a certain advanced notice, which they could then provide addequate public notice for the regulation that would cover the event as long as it did not violate any of the Acts mentioned in the preamble or provide significant hardship to the area.",,,,,,,

Subj: Re: Docket No. USCG-2022-0360

The Gulf Intracoastal Canal Association (GICA) is a 117-year-old trade association representing over 160 member companies involved in inland towing and barge transportation, shipping, shipyards, port operations and related maritime industries which use the 1200 miles of Gulf Intracoastal Waterway (GIWW) between Brownsville, Texas and St. Marks, Florida. GICA is committed to facilitating commerce by ensuring safe, reliable, and efficient Gulf Coast waterways. 

This letter is in response to Drawbridge Operation Regulation; Back Bay of Biloxi, Biloxi, MS (Docket No. USCG-2022-0360) regarding a proposal to initiate a temporary deviation to the existing bridge operating regulations to support remote bridge operations. Several recent casualties involving inland towing vessels and remotely operated bridges over the past year on various waterways throughout the Eighth U.S. Coast Guard District have been reported and are very disconcerting. 
 
GICA does not support any temporary deviation to the existing bridge operating regulations to support remote bridge operations until a detailed root cause analysis is conducted of each of the aforementioned casualties.  The root cause analysis is needed to determine if systemic issues exist regarding remotely operated bridges which need to be addressed prior to authorizing any subsequent temporary deviations.  

Thank you for your consideration.  GICA looks forward to working with you and your staff in the years to come to facilitate commerce through ensuring safe, reliable and efficient Gulf coast waterways. 

Sincerely

Paul Dittman
President 
Gulf Intracoastal Canal Association

I am an urban planner who lives on the mainland and works in Sunny Isles Beach, Miami Beach, North Bay Village and other coastal communities. I have been stopped at the open bridge and consequently late for meetings, site visits and other work-related activities more times than I can remember. The proposed change would be most welcome in helping narrowing the windows for which I need to plan and reduce my chances to get stuck at the bridge. I can only imagine how much more impactful the change would be on local residents of those areas trying to reach work or home during rush hour! Therefore, I urge the Coast Guard to adopt the proposed rule. 

Thank you. ",,,,,,,

Reducing the openings, especially during morning and afternoon rush hours will be greatly appreciated.

Please be aware that when the bridge is open or gets stuck, we are cut off from the major hospitals on mainland Dade County and must re-route to Mount Sinai, which is the only hospital east of the Intracoastal waterway.

When the bridge gets stuck, which seem to happen quite often, the traffic backs up for about a mile on both sides of the bridge along SR934 causing a lot of anger among the hundreds of drivers and occupants on both sides of the open bridge.  

What is the purpose of opening this bridge so frequently?  Why do a hundreds if not a thousand people have to be inconvenienced by a few people in large (or tall) vessels?  

Why can't a few people in a few large ships be inconvenienced instead by having fewer openings?",,,,,,,

I live on the island between the two bridges and strongly support a fixed schedule for bridge openings. For those of us living here, the random openings can have negative effects such as arriving to work late, and even missing airplanes.  If we could plan around a fixed schedule it would help tremendously in avoiding missed appointments, etc. 

Thank you for supporting a fixed schedule for bridge openings.

For the past 18 years I have lived between the two draw bridges on the 79th Street Causeway. I have recently moved east to Miami Beach, but now I have to cross both draw bridges if I want to get to Biscayne Blvd or to I-95.

Over this time, I have seen the great inconvenience to motorists who during the week are traveling to and from work or for work. Typically, I see over 60 cars wasting petrol, creating noxious fumes idling for 15 to 20 minutes. Why? All for the benefit of one leisure boat, who wants to cross which is fine, but why can't it be set at fixed time periods such as on the hour or the half hour. Motorists will know when the bridges will open and can plan accordingly.


So many motorists are late to their appointments because of the serendipity of the draw bridge openings. Think about the cost of lost time for over 60 cars at a time, many of them on the clock, the gallons of gas being wasted from idling and the pollution entering in the atmosphere. 

Thank you for considering this change. We have waited long enough.

These changes to the bridge hours are much needed. This bridge is a nuisance. It negatively impacts thousands of drivers for the convince of a few vessels. This bridge is known to break several times a year for hours at a time. Twice my five minute ride home from Publix turned into an hour and half detour to get home. Frozen items were thawed by the time I got home. Every NBV resident has a feeling of dread every time it goes up. Never sure when it may go back down.  The lack of timely communication to the village alert system during outages causes a headache as well.  I joined the notification system just because of this bridge. 

Please restrict the hours and improve our quality of life east of the bridge. 

Best Regards 

Jim Violi 

BTW 
It is long overdue for regulations to be changed in favor of vehicles vs. trains and boats. They may have been here first, but cars and trucks are by far the most common form of transportation and our regulations should reflect that. ",,,,,,,

As a boater this decrease will simply mean a little more planning for a morning or afternoon trip, this is not the end of the world.  Going boating with any size boat much less one that requires an opening is all about planning so being aware of bridge openings goes hand and hand.

I and my family of four hope this change is put into place and thank you for your consideration.

To release the causeway to the traffic should not get more than 2 minutes after drawbridge returned to the horizontal position. Why takes so much time?
how this issue will be fixed?
3-Even if vessels will be forced to pass by in a specific hours, that action will not reduce the traffic issues, because ONLY residents will be aware of that, but that way is largely used by tourists which are not familiar with most of regulations for traffic.

I traverse both bridges quite frequently as there is no other option for getting off our islands to the mainland of MIami and MIami Beach and have seen very few instances where there are vessels in queue to pass the locations.  Thank you for your cooperation and allowing us to ease the frustrations of many that cross these bridges.",,,,,,,

The temporary schedule of one time per hour needs to stay in effect. This is a major thoroughfare for this part of the county and the beaches. It is very disheartening that a government entity does not take the people into effect to help during what everyone knows are very heavy traffic times. That is why they call it rush hour. It is very frustrating that you have Coast Guard and FDOT who do not even consider the other’s needs. What you need to do is push FDOT to build a higher bridge since they are currently working on fixes and construction of the bridge. Please do the right thing and consider the people that pay taxes and need to work to support their families.
I am happy to discuss if you want to call.

I live in North Bay Village and would really appreciate making the temporary bridge schedule permanent. The cahnge has made a tremendous difference in commuting. Especially given the bad track record of the bridge malfunctioning.  When we commute towards I-95 we have to deal with this bridge and the railroad crossing on the other side of Biscayne. 
Please keep the interests of the residents and daily commuters at the forefront. We have deadlines to be at work, so we can make the money and pay the taxes that support the bridge. 
Thank you very much.

Subject:
A new “cybersecurity risks” for river and waterway industry stakeholder and recreational boaters. Meeting for July12th, 2022.


The Army Corps of Engineers USACE Mobile District has started preparing for the (offsite) operations computer control of the- Jim Woodruff Dam, a navigation and hydroelectric dam on the Apalachicola River, located at the confluence of the Flint and Chattahoochee Rivers along the common border of Florida and Georgia. 

The USACE Jim Woodruff hydroelectric dam soon will be remotely operated and controlled from a site approximately 100 miles north at the USACE Walter F. George Dam, located on the Chattahoochee along Alabama and Georgia.

Openly the USACE Mobile District’s goal may involve implementing remote operations (off-site) control of more Army Corps navigation and hydroelectric dams. Possibly to be controlled at one control site the USACE South Atlantic Division Headquarters in Atlanta. 

While the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers, IFPTE have specific security and safety concerns for the working mariners the waterway industry stakeholders and the public enjoying recreational boating we have brought this new cybersecurity risk to your attention.

After the “Colonial” pipeline cyber security disaster and many more attacks on the U.S. the Army Corps of Engineers USACE is still doggedly working to put our top navigation and hydroelectric federal ""critical infrastructures"" lock and dams under their form of an off-site computer operated remote control systems. 

Cybersecurity threats are evolving rapidly. The dark web and hostile governments are openly working to exploit vulnerabilities on critical infrastructure. Now the USACE soon will open new targets (federal dams) for the dark web and hostile governments to exploit and do great harm to our economy, the power grid and surely the public’s safety. 

As the U.S. Coast Guard is mandated to secure the public’s safety by Congress. How will the USCG and the DHS work to secure and provide oversite for this new cybersecurity threat to the rivers and waterways as the operation of off-site control of USACE dams is moving forward? 

•	The National Maritime Security Advisory Committee now must consult with and bring this new security issue of (off-site operations of USACE dams) and makes needed recommendations to the Secretary of Homeland Security.

The IFPTE recommends the Secretary call for the end of any testing of or any operations by (off-site) control for any Army Corps of Engineers USACE critical infrastructures, hydroelectric dams and navigation lock and dams nationwide - Until - Congress, working with the Department of Homeland Security, (DHS) the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency CISA and the U.S. Coast Guard and the USACE all working on matters relating to national maritime security have time to review this (new cybersecurity risks) now developing under the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers USACE. 

Cybersecurity is a national security and economic security imperative for the government. USACE (off-site) operations opens us all to cyber security disasters that will greatly affect critical infrastructures, our ports, cities and towns all along our rivers and waterways. Noting, President Biden has made cybersecurity, a critical element of the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) mission, a top priority for the Biden-Harris Administration at all levels of government.

Homeport does not allow links to documents within the site and also does not allow persons outside of the USCG to post or collaborate on any of the documents. It simply provides the ability for securely vetted plan holders to ""drop"" documents or for most users to download static versions of existing documents. In addition, there is no interface with sites such as those hosted by PHMSA, DOI, or ERMA (NOAA's Common Operating Picture Website for using Geographic Response Plans/Strategies with fully functioning GIS features). The use of the homeport site is from a double tabular interface which leads non-intuitively to a series of dropdowns that represent the various ports and Sectors. It is from those tabs that a user would eventually be able to access the various ACP's and attachments. It would be more beneficial for most users to have all of these plans hosted on a single interface page that was able to utilize and access other agency websites with GIS features like PHMSA and ERMA. The site should break the ports and sectors into a visual map interface selector with which ACP's could be selected by region to cut down on confusion especially from non-US plan holders. As most ACP's have been developed over the years almost entirely in a ""vacuum"" regionally the hosting of plans in a single site could allow better side by side comparison and best practices with plans from other parts of the US. This could also allow better connectivity to National Response Team and Regional Response Team websites in addition to special teams notices. Lastly it would allow multiple ACP's to link to the latest versions of reference documents if those documents were also hosted on the singular site which could also lead to faster and more accurate collaboration among  ACP partners.",,,,,,,

Potential replacement titles could be: ""Differentiating Responses to Hazardous Substance from Oil"" or ""Key Concerns of Hazardous Substance Response""  
  
2) The State Policy subsection (7060.3) would be better retitled as ""State Authorities and Policies"" but this leaves out information on Federal and Tribal authorities and policies which may or may not be necessary

3) A federal authorities subsection may be necessary under Hazardous Substance Response (7060) to ensure that there is a clear area in the ACP where it is indicated that DOE or DOD or other federal agency provides the FOSC for releases of hazardous substances [40 CFR 300.120(c)/(d)] and how those authorities and actions are coordinated with the ACP.",,,,,,,

Section 6040 covers “Environmentally Sensitive Areas.”  But, the planning for control or cleanup of a spill might also need to accommodate the protection of specific sensitive wildlife species.  That protection might be totally different if eggs of an at-risk or endangered species of turtle, nest of an endangered bird species, an endangered species of fish, or an endangered species of plant were at risk.  Having an additional heading, like 6050 covering “Sensitive and Endangered Species” would require that such information would be included in the planning and implementation of.   Including that information might make the difference between an environmental disaster or success.

RE: PWSRCAC Recertification [Docket number USCG-2022-0707]

As a fisherman and longtime user of the waters of Prince William Sound and the Gulf of Alaska, I wish to support the recertification of the Prince William Sound Regional Citizens’ Advisory Council. This organization has served the citizens of the region for more than 30 years by working with Alyeska Pipeline and the shippers of North Slope oil to see that oil spill prevention and response measures are in place. Personally, I was negatively affected by the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill and am sensitive to safe oil transportation and oil spill prevention.

The organization has done good work over the years fulfilling its mandate as spelled out by the Oil Pollution Act of 1990. Many issues associated with the terminal and tanker contingency plans have been critiqued and improved because of input from the RCAC. It has encouraged new technology and sees value in things such as the oleophilic skimmers being incorporated in the current contingency plans. 

While good work has been done in the past, I believe the RCAC is still relevant and needed. The world of government regulations and complicated contingency plans are not what the average citizen, myself included, are keen to get into. I believe having an advocate and advisor like the Council gives me confidence that the public’s best interest is being looked after.

I am also encouraged by outreach efforts by RCAC to interest youth in the importance of keeping oil out of the environment and preserving a healthy ocean. The tours that Alyeska and RCAC sponsor for the public during annual fishing vessel training are a meaningful way to show folks part of the safeguard system.

As a recreational bird watcher, I was interested in recent studies sponsored by PWSRCAC to document the distribution of marine birds in eastern PWS. Several species suffered long term declines after the Exxon Valdez disaster. These ongoing studies will not only help establish what birds are likely to be encountered during the

winter in the Sound, but also focus any response and protection efforts on specifically identified areas.

Based on positive past performance as specified in OPA90, PWS RCAC has done good work in promoting the safe transportation of oil and seen that proper planning and response are in place. It has evolved over the years to meet changing needs and is as relevant now as 30 years ago. Please recertify this organization and let them serve the citizens of the region.

Sincerely yours,




James Herbert

Greetings,

I am writing you in support of the US Coast Guard's recertification of the Prince William Sound Regional Citizens' Advisory Council.

I have lived and worked in Prince William Sound year-round since 1977. Early on I became aware of and concerned about issues related to the operations of the Valdez Marine Terminal and oil tanker transportation in Port Valdez and Prince William Sound. At that time there was process to have concerns addressed. Independent research was unheard of. That all changed with the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 and the establishment of the Prince William Sound Regional Citizens' Advisory Council. We now have public access and involvement with research, plan reviews, workshops, best available technology, rick assessment, weather gaps, historical research, tracking and commenting on industry and agency activities, education, outreach and advocacy to improve and protect the entire system; the oil industry, regulatory agencies, communities and especially the rich biological ecosystem of Prince William Sound.

Threats and issues remain. Oil still flows through the pipeline, loaded on to tankers and transported through Prince William Sound. 

I strongly support the recertification Prince William Sound Regional Citizens' Advisory Council.

Sincerely,
David P. Janka

On March 24, 1989, the oil tanker Exxon Valdez ran aground on Bligh Reef, spilling 11.2 million U.S. gallons of oil into Prince William Sound. This event naturally holds historic significance for Valdez, as the terminus for the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System and as a center for oil spill cleanup activity in the aftermath of the spill. The long-term effects of the oil spill are still being felt today in terms of environmental impact and negative economic effects on industries such as fishing and tourism. The twenty-five-plus years since the oil spill have been marked by heated litigation and legislation, and close scrutiny of the oil industry by environmental groups. The same time span has also seen many changes and improvements to the technology and procedures surrounding oil spill prevention and response, resulting in an unprecedented level of service towards protecting the environment of Prince William Sound.

In 2010, the Valdez Museum completed a large-scale update to our Exxon Valdez Oil Spill exhibit. We relied on the PWSRCAC for expert advice on the content. Utilizing rarely-seen artifacts, modern methods of graphics production and presentation, and updated content, the exhibit explores Valdez's unique role in this environmental tragedy.

Given that it is the mission of the VMHA is to preserve, present and interpret the heritage and culture of Valdez, the Copper River Basin, and Prince William Sound, Alaska, the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill is a critical event to remember and to educate our visitors about. The Valdez Museum & Historical Archive will benefit greatly from the recertification of the Prince William Sound Regional Citizens' Advisory Council as we rely on their expertise in developing education programs and exhibits related to this environmental tragedy.

We hope you will recertify PWSRCAC as the citizens' advisory group for Prince William Sound.

Benjamin Bauman and Company of the17th US Coast Guard District ,
I am writing this letter in regards to DOC NUMBER USCG-2022-0707, on behalf of my
company, Pangaea Adventures. We are a small sea kayak guiding and wildlife cruise tour
company based out of Valdez, Alaska, since 1996.
Our daily work specializes in bringing guests from all over the world out into Prince
William Sound for wildlife and glacier viewing and guided kayak trips in some of its remote
coves and bays. Not only do our livelihoods depend directly upon the careful and obviously
necessary management of these waters, the sound is also our home. Like our guests, we are
constantly amazed at the beauty of the pristine waters and abundance of wildlife in the Sound.
We are truly lucky to live, work, and play in such an impressive place!
We appreciate the mission and values of PWSRCAC to promote the environmentally
safe operation of the Valdez Marine Terminal as well as the oil tankers that travel through our
waters to use it. Since its establishment after the Exxon Valdez oil spill, PWSRCAC works
diligently to ensure response readiness, evaluate risks, and propose solutions that will help
maintain a healthy ecosystem in the Sound and prevent another massive tragedy as that one of
1989.
Along with prevention and readiness, the PWSRCAC advocates for the highest safety
and capability standards for tug escorts and oil tankers, increased frequency for piping
infrastructure and tank inspections, and even routine cleanup and spill response drills and
training events. The PWSRCAC also provides public outreach, keeping our community informed
of current issues, progress in training, environmental monitoring, and changes in guidelines. All
of these are enormous responsibilities and important aspects that the PWSRCAC owns and
promises.
Additionally, the PWSRCAC is composed of an amazing group of talented and
personable individuals, each of which I believe has become a positive and effective contributor
to our community.
As a steward for the environment and for Prince William Sound, I am relieved to have
PWSRCAC looking after our home and our community and doing what they can to help us all
avoid any major oil spills from fouling our waters again. I genuinely hope you will recertify
PWSRCAC as the citizen's advisory group for our Prince William Sound.
Thank you,
Tim Duffy, Owner

My affiliation with PWSRCAC began very early on due to my role as counsel for the City of Cordova during and after the Exxon Valdez oil spill.
I served for a time on the PWSRCAC board of directors including serving as president of the board.
In my considered opinion PWSRCAC has more than proven its worth and value to all stakeholders interested in promoting the safe transportation of oil near and through Prince William Sound.  The broad-based makeup of the organization and its commitment to high standards of scientific and ethical credibility help everyone concerned.  The recertifcation process is one that helps identify and define the true value of PWSRCAC.  As the Deepwater Horizon and similar spills demonstrate it is certain that oil spills will occur sooner or later.  In my view the value of PWSRCAC lies in promoting measures and educational activities which mitigate the risk of spills, enhance mutual communication and understanding among stakeholders of those risks and in critical situations function as a valuable community based resource.  I respectfully urge recertification by the USCG of the PWSRCAC.  Please advise of any questions.  Thank you.  Scott A. Sterling, former member of the PWSRCAC board of directors.",,,,,,,

Hello,
I support recertification of the Prince William Sound Regional Citizens’ Advisory Council (PWSRCAC). Its mission to promote environmentally safe operation of the Alyeska terminal and associated tankers is critical.

PWSRCAC’s work with industry, regulators, and communities to ensure response readiness, evaluate risks, and propose solutions has been exemplary over the years. As a former employee of the organization, I know that first-hand. The council’s work on weather monitoring, safety of oil storage tanks in Valdez, environmental research, and more helps ensure the safe transportation of oil through Alaskan waters. Its new ship handling course at AVTEC in Seward is a great addition to oil spill prevention and creates new employment opportunities for Alaskans. 

Sincerely,
Susan Sommer

As a representative of a coastal community, I request the U.S Coast Guard consider and recertify the Prince William Sound Regional Citizens’ Advisory Council. 

The mission of the PWSRCAC is to prepare businesses, communities, and industries to prevent oil spills, monitor risks, and improve the position of environmental activities specific to the Alyeska post. The council provides oversight of the oil storage tank vents, the observance of the weather patterns in William Sound, and their willingness to ensure high risks are not being prolonged. 

The dedicated advisory council distributes responsibility to supervise the condition of oil storage tanks by initiating inspections to repair damaged vents within a timely manner, thus preventing potential oil leaks. The quality maintenance of the core tools used in oil production and transportation is essential to the goals and purposes stated in 33 U.S.C. 2732. The lessons learned from the Exxon Valdez oil spill of 1989 are utilized and implemented by this important council.

Furthermore, the PWSRCAC’s work with other industries such as the Alaska Ocean Observing System, creates a partnership that prioritizes safety and concentrates on data that can lead to innovation. Finally, they reduce risks by monitoring the water supply for contamination, testing equipment, guarding against harm to marine life, preparing for spill disasters, and regulating further environmental goals. 

In accordance with the Environmental Oversight and Monitoring Act of 1990, I trust that the United States Coast Guard will review the recertification materials, consider our causes of support, and conclude that the PWSRCAC has indeed represented the interests of the communities and should be recertified. 

Respectfully,

Representative Sarah Vance",,,,,,,

We have made Cordova our home since before the Trans-Alaska Pipeline began and experienced first-hand the impacts of life pre-oil spill and post-oil spill. Our perspectives come from diverse work histories in the fishing industry, journalism, teaching, tourism, scientific research and fisheries management. 

Establishment of the PWSRCAC was one of the few “good things” to result from the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill (EVOS). For more than 30 years this organization has lived up to its mission of “citizens promoting environmentally safe operation of the Alyeska terminal and associated tankers.”

Using a cooperative approach in its work with industry and regulators, PWSRCAC ensures oil spill response readiness. The volunteers and staff help citizens understand and evaluate risks, as well as propose solutions to improve the terminal operations and transport of oil through Prince William Sound. 

In the immediate aftermath of the EVOS, we talked a lot about complacency and how to avoid it occurring again. While there will always be risks associated with oil spill transport, PWSRCAC works diligently to communicate among residents, industry workers and government agencies. Those communication links are critical to reducing risks and combatting complacency.

We receive PWSRCAC’s newsletters and try to attend their meetings from time to time to stay informed. Their long-term environmental monitoring work contributes significantly to scientific understanding of Prince William Sound. From a citizen’s perspective, it’s great to have their knowledgeable staff and volunteers regularly reviewing the oil spill response plans and monitoring spill drills. 

In summary, PWSRCAC is an excellent advocate on our behalf as residents of Prince William Sound. We trust you will recertify PWSRCAC as the citizens’ advisory group for Prince William Sound.

PWS RCAC plays a vital role in preventing oil spills like the Exxon Valdez and ensuring a better cleanup in the event of any future accidents and spills. Alaska Geographic has partnered with PWSRCAC since 2008 to assist in public engagement, outreach, and education about oil spill recovery and prevention in Prince William Sound. PWSRCAC has significantly strengthened our efforts to engage residents and visitors as active stewards of Alaska's public lands. Their leadership, network of dedicated volunteers and staff, scientific research and monitoring and sharing of findings, training for residents and volunteers, and well-publicized public meetings and outreach events are incredibly effective at educating and engaging the public about oil spill prevention, impacts and remediation. 
With the Alyeska Terminal's ongoing operation and oil transport across Alaska's land and water, combined with aging infrastructure for oil transport, PWSRCAC's role in the region is critical, and they have filled the public need very effectively.
As a partner to PWSRCAC, Alaska Geographic has worked closely with its staff and volunteers to integrate information on oil spill response and prevention and citizen involvement into our public education programs in the Prince William Sound region, as well as to help engage residents and stakeholders with training and outreach. 
PWSRCAC has helped to educate local teachers and students throughout the EVOS spill region communities about the critical role of citizen oversight of the Alyeska terminal and marine operations and citizen engagement in preventing and responding to oil spills of any size.
The Council is a well-respected community partner and a highly effective organization.

I strongly support the rule to make a safety zone to ensure the launch of Artemis I rocket goes smoothly and to plan. I think the exploration and advancements within space programs in the United States are important. But I think there should be some thought over what is going to happen to the fisherman who normally fish and make a livelihood from the area being turned into a temporary safety zone, and what is going to happen to the wildlife that reside within the safety zone. It would not be fair if there is a mishap within the safety zone killing the wildlife and possibly taking away earnings  from the fishermen. Thank you so much for your consideration. ",,,,,,,

I am slightly concerned with the impact this will have on the local economy but I believe they can bear this short burden for their own safety. I just want to make sure that vessels, especially foreign vessels, are given a clear warning to avoid miscommunication. Also, in the event of a scrubbing on the launch, I think it would only be fair to alert vessels again and take down any precautions as soon as possible because it would be unfair to maintain an exclusion zone if the launch is scrubbed. The idea here is good, I just want to make sure that this does not hinder the movement of free trade and free citizens too much as this launch is a passion project for the government and should be treated as such.

Did they include NOAA National Marine Fisheries Service in any of the discussions?
NOAA NMFS is responsible for the stewardship of the nation’s ocean resources and their habitat. NMFS manages our natural resources through sound science and an ecosystem-based approach to ensuring productive and sustainable fisheries, safe sources of seafood to the American consumer, healthy ecosystems and recovery and conservation of protected resources. 
Commercial fishermen have been harvesting seafood from the South Atlantic in these areas for well over 100 years. The statement indicates it was USCG, FAA, NASA and private space operators.
Has NOAA NMFS been provided the data to assess impacts of the potential hazardous substances being released into the marine environment? Has NMFS determined the potential impact of these substances on the habitat?
What are the possible economic impacts to the commercial fishing small business entities that work in these areas if the ecosystem is damaged or contaminated by these hazardous substances?
Section III:   
Have the 5 safety zone areas been evaluated in terms of seafood production for the commercial seafood industry?
What point in the announcement process are all 5 safety zones being enforced? 
Section III:   The Marine Safety Information Bulletin would include:
The geographic coordinates of the activated safety zone,
A map identifying the location of the activated safety zone,
Information related to potential hazards associated with a reentry vehicle splashdown and recovery operations associated with space activities.
1.	Has an environmental impact analysis been done to evaluate the impact of these substances that are being released by these recovery activities?
2.	Are the releases of these hazardous substances being recorded? Are they being tracked for each splashdown/recovery event?
3.	What levels of Hydrazine and other potential hazardous substances negatively impact the habitat? How/when can they enter into the food chain and what levels are acceptable?
4.	Does this comply with the National Environmental Policy Act?
5.	 Has it been determined the releases of hydrazine and other hazardous substances do not individually or cumulatively have a significant effect environment?
I have concerns with how the information on the locations of the safety zones and when they are being enforced and reopened is being sent to the public. 
This is my understanding of the sequence of events to be as they appear in the CFR:  
1)	A Notice of Enforcement will be published in the Federal Register for the 5 safety zones at least 2 days prior to space vehicle reentry.
a.	When does enforcement of the 5 safety zone areas begin?
b.	Will there also be a Broadcast Notice to Mariners on VHF-FM channel 16?
c.	Will the 5 safety zones be identified on AIS charts? They need to be identified on the electronic tools that are used by mariners. AIS, Chart plotters etc.
d.	How will a commercial fishing vessel that has been at sea for a while or small vessel mariner know where these 5 safety zones are and when they are activated if they don’t have access to the Notice of Enforcement published in the Federal Register?
2)	To the extent possible, 24 hours prior to reentry vehicle splashdown, the public will be informed if 1 of the safety zones will remain closed (enforced) until after recovery operations are complete.
a.	Will this also be broadcast over VHF-FM channel 16?
b.	Does this then open the other 4 safety zones?
3)	After reentry vehicle splashdown recovery, a Broadcast Notice to Mariners on VHF-FM channel 16 will inform the public the safety zone is no longer subject to enforcement. This announcement then grants general permission to be in the safety zone area except within 3 nautical miles of any reentry vehicle or support vessel.
4)	Once the recovery operation is complete, a Broadcast Notice to Mariners on VHF-FM channel 16 will announce the safety zone is open/no longer enforced.
As these activities increase, it will be very important that all commercial fishing vessels have the necessary data, procedures and expected responses to ensure everyone knows what to do and what the hazards are. Announcements of enforcement need to be outbound on Broadcast Notice to Mariners on VHF-FM channel 16 with adequate warning. Expecting these vessels to monitor the Federal Register or any other website has the potential to result in an accidental conflict.
Thank you for the opportunity to comment.

 Many small generational business have fished off the east coast of Florida and the Gulf of Mexico for years.  Most every commercial fishing vessel is a small business that in turn feeds other small businesses that are dependent on the seafood that is harvested by these commercial fishing vessels.   Given the price of fuel and the continued pressure for lower trip limits, every trip a boat makes must take into consideration fishing time and miles transited.  Has there been any economic studies conducted for economical impact due to closures for re-entry or recovery operations if needed?  Has there been any studies done to determine impact to the fisheries from potential ongoing releases of hydrazine and other oil and hazardous materials?

I have concerns on how  these closures will be communicated to the boats-what will be closed and when.  The commercial fishing boats are trying to stay on top of the closures for lift-off, but as the closures for lift-off and re-entries become more frequent in numbers, it is harder to keep up with the closures.  Most of the full time commercial fishing boats are not fast boats and need advance notice of closures.  Some of these boats are making three to four week trips and depending on where they are fishing, communications can be challenging at times.

The commercial fishing industry is a provider of a clean and safe domestic food source to the non-boating American consumer.  Please ensure that everything possible is done to keep the fleet still fishing in coastal Florida waters. 

Thank you for the opportunity to voice my concerns.

United States Coast Guard
Attn: David E. O’Connel
Captain, U.S. Coast Guard, Captain of the Port Maryland-National Capital Region
USCG-2022-0895

Yes I think the coast guard should establish safety zones. It would save lives and help a lot of people. It would keep people out of the dangerous waters. These safety zones would also keep vessels out, so there would be nothing going through the waters and I think that’s a great idea. I feel like it would stop people from drowning in the dangerous waters. I would like to thank the coast guard for protecting and keeping our waterways safe.

                                        Sincerely,
                                        Kolt Suhr",,,,,,,

I appreciate that the Coast Guard is working hand in hand with other branches of government and SpaceX to make sure our exploration of space goes smoothly back on the ground. My only comment is a worry I have about how well published the information about the spacecraft reentry and safe zones will be. From the rule, what I read was, ""To the extent feasible, the Sector Commander or a designated representative would inform the public of the activation of the three temporary safety zones by Notice of Enforcement (NOE) published in the Federal Register at least two days before the reentry vehicle splashdown.""

In my opinion, this is insufficient notice. Very few people look at the Federal Register on a regular basis, and this means that very few people will see any notice posted there about the temporary zones being activated and the spacecraft debris hitting the ocean. To give a suggestion, I would recommend having local news agencies report on both the date and time of the spacecraft reentry and the whereabouts and nature of the temporary safety zones. In addition, I would have signs posted in major marinas and beaches closest to the three sites to provide extra notice to the public. This is in the interest of the greatest safety and transparency for people that will potentially be affected by the safety zones. This will help avoid people being caught up with the Coast Guard or impeded by spacecraft materials that fall back into the ocean.

As I said before, keep up the good work and continue to collaborate with NASA and SpaceX! I am very excited for the future of space travel. Thanks for all the work the Coast Guard does.",,,,,,,

[Docket No. USCG-2023-0063]
Port Access Route Study: Approaches to Galveston Bay and Sabine Pass, Texas, and Calcasieu Pass, Louisiana

The following comments represent the concerns of the Sabine Pilots Association regarding the currently designated and proposed offshore fairway anchorages near the current location of the Sabine “SB” buoy and the future site of the “SB” buoy. 
The fairway anchorages proposed, via our local; U.S. Coast Guard Office, along the Sabine Pass Safety Fairway to accommodate vessels of varying drafts and sizes up to the future channel design draft of 48 feet should be defined as soon as possible to ensure that the traffic system is prepared for the final authorization of the deepened Sabine Neches Channel.

The current and future anchorages are adjacent to the ship channel and outside the areas designated for the proposed wind farm areas. 
The proposed anchorages should be authorized immediately, before the port access route study is initiated for wind farms.

Next, the Coast Guard will have the ability to have specialized authorization from the First Coast Guard District commander or a designated representative to enter or remain in the safety zones.

The fishing industry is more knowledgeable about these waters and hazards (whales) then the new builders you will be overseeing.  To put more restraints on the generations who have been taught to respect the ocean would be harmful to all humans.   This is going to be an issue for entire east coast.

On March 30, 2023, these Tall Ships of America will be visiting the Port of St Pete, in St Petersburg, FL. The coast guard has set a parimeter for a temporary moving safety zone on the waters of Tampa Bay to ensure the saftey of the wooden boats, the public, and the crew on board the ships. The coast guard made this ruling to ensure the safety of vessels and the navigable waters within a 100-yard radius of the American vessels. The guard has prohibited any vessels from entering this zone to make sure that everyone is safe and no harm will come to these historic boats.

This was a really intresting read for me! My family grew up on the water and fishing/ being on boats was all the talk when I was younger. There is a lot of boat saftey and regulations when ships are coming in-shore so I believe this ruling by the Coast Guard should be followed. The wooden boats are beautiful and sturdy but can tip in waves very easily. The wrong hit can turn this parade into a disaster so I do agree with the parimeter being used. ",,,,,,,

The fireworks are to be launched from a barge in Washington Channel in the Potomac River in front of the Wharf in Washington, DC. Hazards from firework displays include accidental discharge of fireworks, dangerous projectiles, and falling hot embers or other debris. The Captain of the Port Maryland-National Capital Region (COTP) has determined that potential hazards associated with the fireworks to be used in this display would be a safety concern for anyone within a 200-foot radius of the barge.

The purpose of this rulemaking is to ensure the safety of vessels and the navigable waters within a 200-foot radius of the fireworks barge before, during, and after the scheduled event. The Coast Guard is requesting that interested parties provide comments within a shortened comment period of 15 days instead of the typical 30 days for this notice of proposed rulemaking. The Coast Guard believes the 15-day comment period still provides for a reasonable amount of time for interested parties to review the proposal and provide informed comments on it while also ensuring the Coast Guard has time to review and respond to any significant comments and has a final rule in effect in time for the scheduled event in order to protect against the identified hazards.",,,,,,,

I agree with the proposal of extending the security zone to 50 yards more. I thought a rule would already be in place that a vessel could not be that close.

Military business and operations are taking place there and no one needs to be that close to the island. ",,,,,,,
